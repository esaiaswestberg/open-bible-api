And I ⌞looked up⌟ and I saw, and look, a man, and in his hand was a measuring rope!
And I asked, “Where are you going?” And he answered me, “To measure Jerusalem to see what is its width and what is its length.”
And look, the angel who was talking to me was coming forward, and another angel was coming forward to meet him.
And he said to him, “Run, say to that young man, ‘Jerusalem shall be inhabited ⌞like villages without walls⌟ because of the multitude of people and animals in its midst.
And I will be for it a wall of fire all around,’ ⌞declares⌟ Yahweh, ‘and I will be the glory in its midst.’ ”
“Woe! Woe! Flee from the land of the north,” ⌞declares⌟ Yahweh, “for I have scattered you like the four winds of the heavens,” ⌞declares⌟ Yahweh.
“Woe, Zion! Escape, you inhabitants of the daughter of Babylon!”
For thus said Yahweh of hosts, after glory he sent me against the nations plundering you: Truly, the one touching you is touching the apple of his eye.
“Yes, look! I am going to wave my hand against them, and they will become plunder for their servants, and you will know that Yahweh of hosts has sent me.
Sing and rejoice, O daughter of Zion, for look, I am coming and I will dwell in your midst,” ⌞declares⌟ Yahweh.
“Many nations will join themselves to Yahweh on that day, and they will be my people, and I will dwell in your midst. And you will know that Yahweh of hosts has sent me to you.
And Yahweh will inherit Judah as his portion ⌞in the holy land⌟, and he will again choose Jerusalem.
Be silent, ⌞all people⌟, before Yahweh, for he is roused from ⌞his holy dwelling⌟.”

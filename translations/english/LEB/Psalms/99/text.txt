Yahweh is king; let the peoples tremble. He sits enthroned between the cherubim. Let the earth shake.
Yahweh is great in Zion, and he is exalted over all the peoples.
Let them praise your great and fearful name. He is holy.
And the strength of the king loves justice. You have established equity; you have executed justice and righteousness in Jacob.
Exalt Yahweh our God, and worship at his footstool. He is holy.
Moses and Aaron were among his priests; Samuel also was among those who called on his name. They called to Yahweh, and he answered them.
He spoke to them in the pillar of cloud. They kept his testimonies and the statute he gave to them.
O Yahweh our God, you answered them. You were a forgiving God to them, but an avenger of their wrong deeds.
Exalt Yahweh our God, and worship at his holy mountain, for Yahweh our God is holy.

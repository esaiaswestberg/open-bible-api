In my distress I called to Yahweh, and he answered me.
“Deliver my life, O Yahweh, from lying lips, from a deceitful tongue.”
What shall be given to you, and what more shall be done to you, deceitful tongue?
The sharpened arrows of a warrior, with burning charcoals from broom trees.
Woe to me, that I sojourn in Meshech, that I dwell among the tents of Kedar.
Too long my soul has had its dwelling near one who hates peace.
I am for peace, but when I speak, they are for war.

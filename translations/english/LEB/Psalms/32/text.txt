Happy is he whose transgression is taken away, whose sin is covered.
Happy is a person to whom Yahweh does not impute iniquity and in whose spirit there is not deceit.
When I kept silent, my bones were worn out due to my groaning all the day.
For day and night your hand was heavy upon me. My vigor was changed into the dry heat of summer. Selah
I made known my sin to you, and my iniquity I did not cover. I said, “I will confess concerning my transgressions to Yahweh,” and you took away the guilt of my sin. Selah
Therefore let all the faithful pray to you at the time for finding you. Surely at the flood of many waters they will not reach him.
You are my hiding place; from trouble you preserve me. With cries of deliverance you surround me. Selah
I will instruct you and teach you in the way that you should go. I will advise you with my eye upon you.
Do not be like a horse or like a mule, without understanding; that needs his tackle—bridle and rein—for restraint or he would not come near you.
Many are the pains of the wicked, but for the one who trusts Yahweh loyal love surrounds him.
Be glad in Yahweh and rejoice, you righteous, and shout for joy, all you upright of heart.

To you, O Yahweh, I lift up my soul.
O my God, I trust you; let me not be put to shame. Do not let my enemies exult over me.
Indeed, none who wait for you should be put to shame. Those who betray without cause should be put to shame.
Make me know your ways, O Yahweh. Teach me your paths.
Cause me to walk in your truth and teach me, because you are the God of my salvation. I await you ⌞all day long⌟.
Remember your compassion, O Yahweh, and your acts of loyal love, because they are from of old.
Do not remember the sins of my youth or my transgressions. According to your loyal love remember me if you will, for the sake of your goodness, O Yahweh.
Good and right is Yahweh; therefore he instructs sinners in the way.
He causes the humble to walk in justice, and teaches the humble his way.
All the paths of Yahweh are loyal love and faithfulness for those who keep his covenant and statutes.
Also, for the sake of your name, O Yahweh, forgive my sin, because it is great.
Who is the man fearing Yahweh? He will instruct him in the way he should choose.
His soul will lodge in prosperity, and his offspring will possess the land.
Intimate fellowship with Yahweh is for those who fear him, and he makes known his covenant to them.
My eyes are continually toward Yahweh, because he will take my feet from the net.
Turn to me and have mercy on me because I am lonely and afflicted.
Remove the troubles of my heart; bring me out from my distresses.
Consider my affliction and trouble, and forgive all my sins.
Consider that my enemies are many, and they hate me with violent hatred.
Protect my life and deliver me. Let me not be put to shame, because I take shelter in you.
Let integrity and uprightness preserve me, because I wait for you.
O God, redeem Israel from all its troubles.

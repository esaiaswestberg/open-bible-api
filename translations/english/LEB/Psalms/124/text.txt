“If it had not been Yahweh who was on our side,” do let Israel say,
“If it had not been Yahweh who was on our side, when men rose up against us,
then they would have swallowed us alive, when their anger was kindled against us.
Then the waters would have flooded over us, the torrent would have passed over our soul.
Then over our soul would have passed the raging waters.”
Blessed be Yahweh, who has not made us prey for their teeth.
Our soul has escaped like a bird from the snare of fowlers. The snare is broken, and we have escaped.
Our help is in the name of Yahweh, maker of heaven and earth.

Of the sons of Korah. A psalm.  How lovely are your dwelling places, O Yahweh of hosts!
My soul longs and even fails for the courtyards of Yahweh. My heart and flesh sing for joy to the living God.
Even a bird finds a home, and a swallow a nest for herself, where she may lay her young, near your altars, O Yahweh of hosts, my king and my God.
Blessed are those who dwell in your house; they can ever praise you. Selah
Blessed is the man whose strength is in you; in their heart are the highways to Zion.
Passing through the Valley of Baca, they make it a spring. The early rain covers it with blessings as well.
They go from strength to strength, until each appears before God in Zion.
O Yahweh, God of hosts, hear my prayer; give ear, O God of Jacob. Selah
Look at our shield, O God, and have regard for the face of your anointed one.
Because better is a day in your courtyards than a thousand elsewhere. I would rather be at the threshold of the house of my God than to dwell in the tents of wickedness.
Because Yahweh God is a sun and a shield; Yahweh gives grace and honor. He does not withhold good from those who walk blamelessly.
O Yahweh of hosts, blessed is the man who trusts you.

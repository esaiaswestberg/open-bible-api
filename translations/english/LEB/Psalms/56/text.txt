Of David. A miktam. When the Philistines seized him in Gath.  Be gracious to me, O God, because humankind has trampled me; fighting all the day he oppresses me.
My enemies trample all day, because many are attacking me proudly.
⌞When⌟ I fear, I trust you.
God, whose word I praise, God I trust; I do not fear. What can mere flesh do to me?
All day they twist my words; all their thoughts are against me for evil.
They attack, they hide, they watch my ⌞steps⌟, as they lie in wait for my life.
Because of iniquity will they escape? In anger cast down the peoples, O God.
You have kept count of my wonderings. Put my tears in your bottle; are they not in your book?
Then my enemies will turn back ⌞when⌟ I call. This I know because God is for me.
God, whose word I praise, Yahweh, whose word I praise,
God I trust; I do not fear. What can mere humankind do to me?
My vows to you, O God, are binding upon me. I will pay thank offerings to you,
because you have delivered my soul from death. Have you not kept my feet from stumbling, that I may walk before God in the light of the living?

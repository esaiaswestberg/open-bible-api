I love him, because Yahweh has heard ⌞the voice of my supplications⌟.
Because he has inclined his ear to me, I will call ⌞all my days⌟.
The ropes of death encircled me, and the distresses of Sheol found me. I found trouble and grief.
Then I called on the name of Yahweh: “O Yahweh, please save my life!”
Gracious is Yahweh and righteous, and our God is merciful.
Yahweh watches over the simple. I was brought low, but he gave me victory.
Return, O my soul, to your repose, for Yahweh has dealt bountifully with you.
For you have rescued me from death, my eyes from tears, my feet from stumbling.
I will walk before Yahweh in the land of the living.
I believed when I spoke, “I am afflicted greatly.”
I said in my haste, “⌞Everyone⌟ is a liar.”
What shall I give back to Yahweh for all his benefits to me?
I will lift up the cup of salvation and proclaim the name of Yahweh.
I will pay my vows made to Yahweh in the presence of all his people.
Costly ⌞in Yahweh’s view⌟ is the death of his faithful ones.
Ah, Yahweh, I am indeed your servant; I am your servant, the child of your maidservant. You have loosed my bonds.
I will offer to you a sacrifice of thanksgiving, and proclaim the name of Yahweh.
I will pay my vows made to Yahweh in the presence of all his people,
in the courts of the house of Yahweh, in the midst of you, O Jerusalem. Praise Yah!

Yahweh, our Lord, how majestic is your name in all the earth, who put your splendor above the heavens.
From the mouth of children and infants you have founded strength on account of your enemies, to silence the enemy and the avenger.
When I look at your heavens, the work of your fingers, the moon and the stars which you set in place—
what is a human being that you think of him? and a child of humankind that you care for him?
And you made him a little lower than heavenly beings, and with glory and with majesty you crowned him.
You make him over the works of your hands; all things you have placed under his feet:
sheep and cattle, all of them, and also the wild animals of the field,
the birds of the sky and the fish of the sea, everything that passes along the paths of seas.
Yahweh, our Lord, how majestic is your name in all of the earth!

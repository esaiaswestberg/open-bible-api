I will sing of loyal love and justice; I will sing praises to you, O Yahweh.
I will give attention to the way of integrity. When will you come to me? I will walk in the integrity of my heart in the midst of my house.
I will not set before my eyes any wicked thing. I hate the work of those who fall away; it will not cling to me.
A perverse heart will depart from me; I will not know evil.
One who slanders his neighbor in secret, him I will destroy. One haughty of eyes and ⌞arrogant⌟ of heart, him I will not endure.
My eyes will be on the faithful of the land, that they may live with me. He who walks in the way of integrity, he shall minister to me.
There will not live in the midst of my house a worker of deceit. One who speaks lies will not remain before my eyes.
⌞Each morning⌟, I will destroy all the wicked of the land, cutting off from the city of Yahweh all evildoers.

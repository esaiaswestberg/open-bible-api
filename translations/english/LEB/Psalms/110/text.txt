A declaration of Yahweh to my lord, “Sit at my right hand until I make your enemies your footstool.”
Yahweh will send out your mighty scepter from Zion; rule in the midst of your enemies.
Your people ⌞will volunteer⌟ in the day of your power. In holy splendor, from the womb of the dawn, you will have the dew of your youth.
Yahweh has sworn and he will not change his mind, “You are a priest forever according to the manner of Melchizedek.”
O Lord, at your right hand he will shatter kings in the day of his anger.
He will judge among the nations; he will fill them with corpses. He will shatter the ⌞rulers⌟ of many countries.
He will drink from the stream by the road; therefore he will lift up his head.

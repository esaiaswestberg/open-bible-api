Yahweh is king! Let the earth rejoice; let many coastlands be glad.
Cloud and thick darkness are surrounding him; righteousness and justice are the foundation of his throne.
Fire goes before him, and devours his enemies round about.
His lightnings light the world; the earth sees and trembles.
The mountains melt like wax at the presence of Yahweh, at the presence of the Lord of all the earth.
The heavens declare his righteousness, and all the peoples see his glory.
Let all who serve an image be ashamed, those who boast about idols. Worship him, all you gods.
Zion hears and is glad, and the daughters of Judah rejoice because of your judgments, O Yahweh.
For you, O Yahweh, are most high over all the earth. You are highly exalted above all gods.
You who love Yahweh, hate evil. He protects the lives of his faithful; he delivers them from the hand of the wicked.
Light is sown for the righteous, and joy for the upright in heart.
Be glad in Yahweh, you righteous, and give thanks ⌞to his holy name⌟.

Praise Yah. Praise Yahweh from the heavens; praise him in the heights.
Praise him, all his angels; praise him, all his hosts.
Praise him, sun and moon; praise him, all stars of light.
Praise him, ⌞highest heavens⌟, and waters above the heavens.
Let them praise the name of Yahweh, because he commanded and they were created.
And he put them in place forever and ever, by a decree he gave that will not pass away.
Praise Yahweh from the earth— great sea creatures and all deeps,
fire and hail, snow and cloud, stormy wind doing his bidding,
the mountains and all hills, fruit trees and all cedars,
beasts and all cattle, creeping things and ⌞flying birds⌟,
kings of the earth and all peoples, princes and all judges of the earth,
young men and young women as well, the old together with the young—
let them praise the name of Yahweh, because his name alone is is exalted. His splendor is above earth and heavens.
And he has raised high a horn for his people, praise for all his faithful— for the children of Israel, a people close to him. Praise Yah.

The earth is Yahweh’s, with its fullness, the world and those who live in it,
because he has founded it on the seas, and has established it on the rivers.
Who may ascend the mountain of Yahweh? And who may stand in his holy place?
He who is innocent of hands and pure of heart, who does not lift up his soul to falseness, and does not swear deceitfully.
He will receive blessing from Yahweh, and justice from the God of his salvation.
Such is the sort of those who seek him, those who seek your face, even Jacob. Selah
Lift up your heads, O gates, and rise up, O ancient doorways, that the king of glory may enter.
Who is the king of glory? Yahweh, strong and mighty; Yahweh, mighty in war!
Lift up your heads, O gates, and lift up, O ancient doorways, that the king of glory may enter.
Who is the king of glory? Yahweh of hosts, He is the king of glory! Selah

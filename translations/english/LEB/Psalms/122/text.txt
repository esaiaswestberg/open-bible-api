I rejoiced in those who said to me, “Let us go to the house of Yahweh.”
Our feet are standing within your gates, O Jerusalem—
Jerusalem that is built as a city that is joined together,
where the tribes go up, the tribes of Yah as a testimony for Israel, to give thanks to the name of Yahweh.
For there the thrones sit for judgment, thrones of David’s house.
Pray for the peace of Jerusalem: “May those who love you be at ease.
May peace be within your walls, security within your palaces.”
For the sake of my brothers and my friends, I will say, “Peace be within you.”
For the sake of the house of Yahweh our God, I will seek your good.

Then Bildad the Shuhite answered and said,
“⌞How long⌟ ⌞will you hunt for words⌟? Consider, and afterward we shall speak.
Why are we considered as animals? Why are we taken as stupid in your eyes?
“You who are tearing ⌞yourself⌟ in your anger, will the earth be forsaken because of you? Or will the rock be removed from its place?
Furthermore, the light of the wicked is put out, and the flame of his fire will not shine.
The light becomes dark in his tent, and his lamp above him is put out.
“⌞His strong steps⌟ are shortened, and his own schemes throw him down,
for he is thrust into a net by his feet, and he walks into a pitfall.
A trap seizes him by the heel; a snare takes hold of him.
His rope is hidden in the ground, and his trap on the path.
“Sudden terrors terrify him all around, and they chase him at his heels.
His wealth will become hunger, and disaster is ready for his stumbling.
It consumes parts of his skin; the firstborn of death consumes his limbs.
He is torn from his tent ⌞in which he trusted⌟, and it brought him to the king of terrors.
“⌞Nothing⌟ remains for him in his tent; sulfur is scattered upon his dwelling place.
His roots dry up ⌞below⌟, and its branches wither away above.
His remembrance perishes from the earth, and there is not a name for him on the street.
“They thrust him from light into darkness, and they drive him out from the world.
There is no offspring for him nor a descendant among his people, and there is not a survivor in his abode.
Those of the west are appalled over ⌞his fate⌟, and those of the east ⌞are seized with horror⌟.
Surely these are the dwellings of the godless, and this is the dwelling place of him who knows not God.”

Now when the wall had been built and I had erected the doors and appointed the gatekeepers, singers, and the Levites,
I gave command over Jerusalem to my brother Hanani and Hananiah the commander of the citadel. For he was a faithful man and feared God more than many.
I said to them, “Do not open the gates of Jerusalem until the sun is hot. While they are standing guard let them shut and fasten the doors. And appoint guards from the inhabitants of Jerusalem, one at his post and another opposite his house.”
The city was widespread and large, but the people in it were few and no houses were rebuilt.
Then my God put into my heart to assemble the nobles, the prefects, and the people to be enrolled. I found the book of the genealogy of those who first came back, and I found this written upon it:
These are the people of the province who came up from captivity of the exiles whom Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon had carried into exile. They returned to Jerusalem and to Judah, each one to his city.
These came with Zerubbabel, Joshua, Nehemiah, Azariah, Raamiah, Nahamani, Mordecai, Bilshan, Mispereth, Bigvai, Nehum, Baanah.   The number of the men of the people of Israel:

All the temple servants and the descendants of Solomon’s servants were three hundred and ninety-two.
These were the ones who came up from Tel-melah, Tel-harsha, Cherub, Addon, and Immer, but they were not able to prove their ancestral houses or their descent, whether they were from Israel:
the descendants of Delaiah, the descendants of Tobiah, the descendants of Nekoda, six hundred and forty-two.
And from the priests: the descendants of Hobaiah, the descendants of Hakkoz, the descendants of Barzillai (who had taken as a wife from the daughters of Barzillai the Gileadite and was called by their name).
These sought their record among those enrolled in the genealogy, but it was not found there, so they were excluded as unclean from the priesthood.
So the governor said to them that they could not eat the most holy food until a priest could come with Urim and Thummim.
All of the assembly together was forty-two thousand three hundred and sixty,
besides their servants and female slaves—these were seven thousand three hundred and thirty-seven. And the male and female singers were two hundred and forty-five,

there were four hundred and thirty-five camels and six thousand seven hundred and twenty male donkeys.
Now some from the heads of the ⌞families⌟ gave to the work. The governor gave to the storehouse one thousand darics of gold, fifty basins, and five hundred and thirty priestly tunics.
Now some of the heads of the ⌞families⌟ gave to the storehouse of the work twenty thousand gold darics and two thousand two hundred silver minas.
And what the rest of the people gave was twenty thousand darics of gold, and two thousand silver minas, and sixty-seven priestly tunics.
So the priests, the Levites, the gatekeepers, the singers, some of the people, the temple servants, and all Israel settled in their cities. When the seventh month came, the ⌞Israelites⌟ were in their cities.

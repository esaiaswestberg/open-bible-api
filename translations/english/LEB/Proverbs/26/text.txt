Like snow in the summer and like rain at the harvest, so honor is not fitting for a fool.
Like the sparrow is to fluttering and like the swallow is to flying, so an undeserved curse does not go forth.

Like an archer who wounds everyone, so is he who hires a fool or he who hires passersby.

As charcoal is to hot embers and wood is to fire, so a man of quarrels is to kindling strife.
The words of a whisperer are like delicious morsels, and they go down to the inner parts of the body.
Like ⌞impure silver⌟ which overlays an earthen vessel, so are smooth lips and an evil heart.
On his lips, an enemy will pretend, but ⌞inside⌟ he will harbor deceit.

For the larger group you must increase their inheritance, and for the smaller group you must make smaller their inheritance; each must be given ⌞their⌟ inheritance according to the number of the ones counted of them.
Surely the land will be divided by lot. They will inherit according to the names of the tribes of their ancestors.

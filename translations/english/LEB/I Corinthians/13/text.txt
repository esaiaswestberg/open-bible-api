If I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, but do not have love, I have become a ringing brass gong or a clashing cymbal.
And if I have the gift of prophecy and I know all mysteries and all knowledge, and if I have all faith so that I can remove mountains, but do not have love, I am nothing.
And if I parcel out all my possessions, and if I hand over my body in order that I will be burned, but do not have love, it benefits me nothing.
Love is patient, love is kind, love is not jealous, it does not boast, it does not become conceited,
it does not behave dishonorably, it ⌞is not selfish⌟, it does not become angry, it does not keep a record of wrongs,
it does not rejoice at unrighteousness, but rejoices with the truth,
bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things.
Love never ends. But if there are prophecies, they will pass away. If there are tongues, they will cease. If there is knowledge, it will pass away.
For we know in part and we prophesy in part,
but whenever the perfect comes, the partial will pass away.
When I was a child, I spoke like a child, I thought like a child, I reasoned like a child. When I became a man, I set aside the things of a child.
For now we see through a mirror ⌞indirectly⌟, but then face to face. Now I know in part, but then I will know completely, just as I have also been completely known.
And now these three things remain: faith, hope, and love. But the greatest of these is love.

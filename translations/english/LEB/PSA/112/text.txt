Praise Yah! Blessed is the man who fears Yahweh; he takes great delight in his commands.
His ⌞descendants⌟ will be mighty in the land; the generation of the upright will be blessed.
Wealth and riches are in his house, and his righteousness endures forever.
His light rises in the darkness for the upright; he is gracious and compassionate and righteous.
It goes well for a man who is gracious and lends, who conducts his ⌞business properly⌟.
For he will not be shaken forever; the righteous ⌞will be remembered forever⌟.
He is not afraid of bad news; his heart is steadfast, secure in Yahweh.
His heart is sustained; he will not be afraid, until he looks in triumph on his enemies.
⌞He gives lavishly⌟ to the needy; his righteousness endures forever. His horn rises high in honor.
The wicked sees it and is vexed. He gnashes his teeth and ⌞becomes weak⌟. The desire of the wicked perishes.

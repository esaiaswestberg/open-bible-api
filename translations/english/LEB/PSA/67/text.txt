May God be gracious to us and bless us. May he cause his face to shine toward us, Selah
that your way may be known on the earth, your salvation among all nations.
Let the peoples praise you, O God; let all of the peoples praise you.
Let the nations be glad and sing for joy, because you judge the peoples with equity and guide the nations on the earth. Selah
Let the peoples praise you, O God; let all the peoples praise you.
The earth has yielded its produce. God, our God, will bless us.
God will bless us, and all the ends of the earth will fear him.

Save, O Yahweh, for the pious have ceased to be; for the faithful have vanished from among the children of humankind.
They speak falseness ⌞to each other⌟. With flattering lips, with ⌞a double heart⌟ they speak.
May Yahweh cut off all flattering lips, the tongue speaking great boasts—
those who say, “With our tongue we will prevail. Our lips are on our side. Who is master over us?”
“Because of the oppression of the afflicted, because of the groaning of the poor, now I will rise up,” Yahweh says. “I shall put them in the safety for which they long.”
The words of Yahweh are pure words like silver refined in the crucible on the ground, refined seven times.
You, O Yahweh, will protect them. You will preserve him from this generation always.
The wicked prowl about when vileness is exalted among the children of humankind.

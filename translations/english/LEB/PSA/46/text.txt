According to Alamoth. A song.  God is our refuge and strength, a very sufficient help in troubles.
Therefore we will not fear though the earth change, and though the mountains totter into the ⌞midst⌟ of the sea,
though its waters roar and foam, though mountains shake with its surging water. Selah
There is a river whose streams gladden the city of God, the holiest of the dwellings of the Most High.
God is in the midst of her; she will not be made to totter. God will help her ⌞at daybreak⌟.
Nations roar, kingdoms shake; he utters his voice, the earth melts.
Yahweh of hosts is with us; our high stronghold is the God of Jacob. Selah
Come, see the works of Yahweh, who has placed desolations on the earth.
He makes wars cease to the ends of the earth; he breaks the bow and cuts off the spear. The wagons of war he burns with fire.
Be still, and know that I am God. I will be exalted among the nations; I will be exalted in the earth.
Yahweh of Hosts is with us; the God of Jacob is our high stronghold.

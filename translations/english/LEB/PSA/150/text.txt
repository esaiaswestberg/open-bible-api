Praise Yah. Praise God in his sanctuary; praise him in his mighty firmament.
Praise him for his mighty deeds; praise him according to the abundance of his greatness.
Praise him with blast of horn; praise him with harp and lyre.
Praise him with tambourine and dancing; praise him with strings and flute.
Praise him with sounding cymbals; praise him with clashing cymbals.
Every breathing thing, let it praise Yah. Praise Yah.

O Yahweh, you favored your land. You restored the fortunes of Jacob.
You took away the guilt of your people; you covered all their sin. Selah
You withdrew all your wrath; you turned from your burning anger.
Restore us, O God of our salvation, and annul your vexation with us.
Will you be angry against us forever? Will you prolong your anger generation after generation?
Will you not again revive us, that your people might rejoice in you?
Show us, O Yahweh, your loyal love, and grant us your salvation.
I will hear what God, Yahweh, will speak, because he will speak peace to his people, even his faithful ones, but let them not return to folly.
Surely his salvation is near for those who fear him, that glory may abide in our land.
Loyal love and faithfulness will meet one another; righteousness and peace will kiss.
Faithfulness will sprout from the ground, and righteousness will look down from heaven.
Yes, Yahweh will give what is good, and our land will give its produce.
Righteousness will go before him, and it will make his steps a pathway.

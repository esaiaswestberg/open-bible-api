My heart is steadfast, O God. I will sing and give praise, even with my glory.
Awake, harp and lyre. I will awake the dawn.
I will give you thanks among the peoples, O Yahweh; I will give you praise among the nations,
because your loyal love is great above the heavens, and your faithfulness reaches to the clouds.
Be exalted above the heavens, O God, and let your glory be above all the earth,
so that your beloved ones may be rescued. Save by your right hand and answer me.
God has spoken in his holiness, “I will exult, I will divide up Shechem, and portion out the valley of Succoth.
Gilead is mine. Manasseh is mine. And Ephraim is the ⌞helmet for⌟ my head. Judah is my scepter;
Moab is my washing pot. Over Edom I will cast my sandal; Over Philistia I will shout in triumph.”
Who will bring me to the fortified city? Who will lead me to Edom?
Have you not rejected us, O God, and not gone out with our armies, O God?
Give us help against the enemy, for the help of humankind is futile.
Through God we will do valiantly, and it is he who will tread down our enemies.

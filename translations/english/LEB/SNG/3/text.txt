On my bed in the night, I sought him whom my ⌞heart⌟ loves. I sought him, but I did not find him.
Now I will arise, and I will go about in the city, in the streets and in the squares; I will seek him whom my ⌞heart⌟ loves. I sought him, but I did not find him.
The sentinels who go about in the city found me. “Have you seen the one whom my ⌞heart⌟ loves?”
⌞Scarcely had I passed⌟ by them when I found him whom my ⌞heart⌟ loves. I held him and I would not let him go until I brought him to the house of my mother, into the bedroom chamber of she who conceived me.
I adjure you, ⌞O maidens of Jerusalem⌟, by the gazelles or by the does of the field, do not arouse or awaken love until it pleases!

Look! It is Solomon’s ⌞portable couch⌟! Sixty mighty men surround ⌞it⌟, the mighty men of Israel.

⌞King Solomon⌟ made for himself a sedan chair from the wood of Lebanon.
He made its column of silver, its back of gold, its seat of purple; its interior is inlaid with leather by ⌞the maidens of Jerusalem⌟.
Come out and look, ⌞O maidens of Zion⌟, at ⌞King Solomon⌟, at the crown with which his mother crowned him on the day of his wedding, on the day of the joy of his heart!

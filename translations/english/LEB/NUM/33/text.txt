“Speak to the ⌞Israelites⌟ and say to them, ‘When you cross the Jordan into the land of Canaan,
you will drive out the inhabitants of the land from your presence, and you will destroy all their idols and all the images of their molten idols, and you will demolish all their high places;
you will dispossess the land and live in it because I have given the land to you to possess it.
You will distribute the land by lot according to your clans; to the larger group you will give a larger inheritance, and to the smaller group you will give less inheritance. However the lot falls for him, there the lot will be. You will distribute it according to the tribes of your ancestors.
But if you do not drive out the inhabitants of the land from your presence, then it will happen that whomever you let remain of them will be like irritants in your eyes and like thorns in your sides; they will be your enemies in the land in which you live.
And just as I planned to do to them, I will do to you.’ ”

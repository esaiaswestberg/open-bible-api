For every high priest taken from among men is appointed on behalf of people in the things relating to God, in order that he can offer both gifts and sacrifices on behalf of sins,
being able to deal gently with those who are ignorant and led astray, since he himself also is surrounded by weakness,
and because of it he is obligated to offer sacrifices for sins ⌞for himself also, as well as for the people⌟.
And someone does not take for himself the honor, but is called by God, just as Aaron also was.
Thus also Christ did not glorify himself to become high priest, but the one who said to him,   “You are my Son, today I have begotten you,”
just as also in another place he says,   “You are a priest ⌞forever⌟ according to the order of Melchizedek,”
who in the days of his flesh offered up both prayers and supplications, with loud crying and tears, to the one who was able to save him from death, and he was heard as a result of his reverence.
Although he was a son, he learned obedience from what he suffered,
and being perfected, he became the source of eternal salvation to all those who obey him,
being designated by God a high priest according to the order of Melchizedek.
Concerning this ⌞we have much to say and it is difficult to explain⌟, since you have become sluggish in hearing.
For indeed, although you ought to be teachers ⌞by this time⌟, you have need of someone to teach you again the beginning elements of the oracles of God, and ⌞you have need of⌟ milk, not solid food.
For everyone who partakes of milk is unacquainted with the message of righteousness, because he is an infant.
But solid food is for the mature, who because of practice have trained their faculties for the distinguishing of both good and evil.

For there will be a time when they will not put up with sound teaching, but in accordance with their own desires, they will accumulate for themselves teachers, ⌞because they have an insatiable curiosity⌟,

For I am already being poured out as a drink offering, and the time of my departure is imminent.

Make haste to come to me quickly.

The Lord be with your spirit. Grace be with you.

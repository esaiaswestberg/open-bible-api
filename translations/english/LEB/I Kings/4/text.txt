Judah and Israel were as many as the sand which is on the seashore in abundance, eating and drinking and rejoicing!
Now Solomon was ruling over all the kingdoms from the River to the land of the Philistines, and up to the border of Egypt, who were bringing tribute and were serving Solomon all the days of his life.
The food of Solomon for one day was thirty dry measures of choice meal and sixty dry measures of flour;
ten stall-fed oxen and twenty pasture-fed oxen and a hundred sheep, besides deer and buck gazelles and roebucks and well-fed fowls.
For he was ruling over all the west of the River from Tiphsah up to Gaza, over all the kings west of the River; and he had peace from every side all around.
Judah and Israel lived in security, each man under his vine and under his fig tree, from Dan as far as Beersheba, all the days of Solomon.
Now Solomon had forty thousand stalls of horses for his war chariots and twelve thousand horsemen.
These governors sustained King Solomon and all who came near to the table of King Solomon, each in his month; they did not omit anything.
The barley and the straw for the horses and for packhorses they brought to the place where they were, each according to his share.
God gave wisdom to Solomon and very great discernment, as well as ⌞breadth of understanding⌟, as the sand which is on the edge of the seashore.
The wisdom of Solomon was greater than the wisdom of all the people of the east and more than all the wisdom of Egypt.
He was wiser than all the men: Ethan the Ezrahite; Heman, Calcol, and Darda the children of Mahol; and ⌞he was very well known⌟.
He spoke three thousand proverbs, and his songs were one thousand and five.
He spoke concerning the trees, from the cedar which is in Lebanon up to the hyssop which grows on the wall; he also spoke concerning the animals, concerning the birds, concerning the creeping things, and concerning the fish.
They came from all the nations to hear the wisdom of Solomon; from all the kings of the earth who had heard of his wisdom.

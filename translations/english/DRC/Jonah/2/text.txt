Now the Lord prepared a great fish to swallow up Jonah: and Jonah was in the belly of a fish for three days and three nights.
And Jonah prayed to the Lord, his God, out of the belly of the fish.
And he said: I cried out of my affliction to the Lord, and he heard me: I cried out of the belly of hell, and thou hast heard my voice.
And thou hast cast me forth into the deep, in the heart of the sea, and a flood hast compassed me: all thy billows, and thy waves have passed over me.
And I said: I am cast away out of the sight of thy eyes: but yet I shall see the holy temple again.
The waters compassed me about even to the soul: the deep hath closed me round about, the sea hath covered my head.
I went down to the lowest parts of the mountains: the bars of the earth have shut me up for ever: and thou wilt bring up my life from corruption, O Lord, my God.
When my soul was in distress within me, I remembered the Lord: that my prayer may come to thee, unto the holy temple.
They that in vain observe vanities, forsake their own mercy.
But I with the voice of praise will sacrifice to thee: I will pay whatsoever I have vowed for my salvation to the Lord.
And the Lord spoke to the fish: and it vomited out Jonah upon the dry land.

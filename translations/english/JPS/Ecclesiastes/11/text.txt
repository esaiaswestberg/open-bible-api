He that observeth the wind shall not sow; and he that regardeth the clouds shall not reap.
As thou knowest not what is the way of the wind, nor how the bones do grow in the womb of her that is with child; even so thou knowest not the work of G-d who doeth all things.
In the morning sow thy seed, and in the evening withhold not thy hand; for thou knowest not which shall prosper, whether this or that, or whether they both shall be alike good.

For if a man live many years, let him rejoice in them all, and remember the days of darkness, for they shall be many. all that cometh is vanity.
Rejoice, O young man, in thy youth; and let thy heart cheer thee in the days of thy youth, and walk in the ways of thy heart, and in the sight of thine eyes; but know thou, that for all these things G-d will bring thee into judgment.
Therefore remove vexation from thy heart, and put away evil from thy flesh; for childhood and youth are vanity.

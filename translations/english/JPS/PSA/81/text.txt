Sing aloud unto G-d our strength; shout unto the G-d of Jacob.
Take up the melody, and sound the timbrel, the sweet harp with the psaltery.
Blow the horn at the new moon, at the full moon for our feast-day.
For it is a statute for Israel, an ordinance of the G-d of Jacob.
He appointed it in Joseph for a testimony, when He went forth against the land of Egypt. The speech of one that I knew not did I hear:
'I removed his shoulder from the burden; His hands were freed from the basket.
Thou didst call in trouble, and I rescued thee; I answered thee in the secret place of thunder; I proved thee at the waters of Meribah. Selah
Hear, O My people, and I will admonish thee: O Israel, if thou wouldest hearken unto Me!
There shall no strange god be in thee; neither shalt thou worship any foreign god.
I am HaShem thy G-d, who brought thee up out of the land of Egypt; open thy mouth wide, and I will fill it.
But My people hearkened not to My voice; and Israel would none of Me.
So I let them go after the stubbornness of their heart, that they might walk in their own counsels.
Oh that My people would hearken unto Me, that Israel would walk in My ways!
I would soon subdue their enemies, and turn My hand against their adversaries.
The haters of HaShem should dwindle away before Him; and their punishment should endure for ever.
They should also be fed with the fat of wheat; and with honey out of the rock would I satisfy thee.'

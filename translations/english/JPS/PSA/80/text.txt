For the Leader; upon Shoshannim. A testimony. A Psalm of Asaph.
Give ear, O Shepherd of Israel, Thou that leadest Joseph like a flock; Thou that art enthroned upon the cherubim, shine forth.
Before Ephraim and Benjamin and Manasseh, stir up Thy might, and come to save us.
O G-d, restore us; and cause Thy face to shine, and we shall be saved.
O HaShem G-d of hosts, how long wilt Thou be angry against the prayer of Thy people?
Thou hast fed them with the bread of tears, and given them tears to drink in large measure.
Thou makest us a strife unto our neighbours; and our enemies mock as they please.
O G-d of hosts, restore us; and cause Thy face to shine, and we shall be saved.
Thou didst pluck up a vine out of Egypt; Thou didst drive out the nations, and didst plant it.
Thou didst clear a place before it, and it took deep root, and filled the land.
The mountains were covered with the shadow of it, and the mighty cedars with the boughs thereof.
She sent out her branches unto the sea, and her shoots unto the River.
Why hast Thou broken down her fences, so that all they that pass by the way do pluck her?
The boar out of the wood doth ravage it, that which moveth in the field feedeth on it.
O G-d of hosts, return, we beseech Thee; look from heaven, and behold, and be mindful of this vine,
And of the stock which Thy right hand hath planted, and the branch that Thou madest strong for Thyself.
It is burned with fire, it is cut down; they perish at the rebuke of Thy countenance.
Let Thy hand be upon the man of Thy right hand, upon the son of man whom Thou madest strong for Thyself.
So shall we not turn back from Thee; quicken Thou us, and we will call upon Thy name.
O HaShem G-d of hosts, restore us; cause Thy face to shine, and we shall be saved.

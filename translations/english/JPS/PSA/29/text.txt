A Psalm of David. Ascribe unto HaShem, O ye sons of might, ascribe unto HaShem glory and strength.
Ascribe unto HaShem the glory due unto His name; worship HaShem in the beauty of holiness.
The voice of HaShem is upon the waters; the G-d of glory thundereth, even HaShem upon many waters.
The voice of HaShem is powerful; the voice of HaShem is full of majesty.
The voice of HaShem breaketh the cedars; yea, HaShem breaketh in pieces the cedars of Lebanon.
He maketh them also to skip like a calf; Lebanon and Sirion like a young wild-ox.
The voice of HaShem heweth out flames of fire.
The voice of HaShem shaketh the wilderness; HaShem shaketh the wilderness of Kadesh.
The voice of HaShem maketh the hinds to calve, and strippeth the forests bare; and in His temple all say: 'Glory.'
HaShem sat enthroned at the flood; yea, HaShem sitteth as King for ever.
HaShem will give strength unto His people; HaShem will bless his people with peace.

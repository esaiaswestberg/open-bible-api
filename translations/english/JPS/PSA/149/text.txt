Hallelujah. Sing unto HaShem a new song, and His praise in the assembly of the saints.
Let Israel rejoice in his Maker; let the children of Zion be joyful in their King.
Let them praise His name in the dance; let them sing praises unto Him with the timbrel and harp.
For HaShem taketh pleasure in His people; He adorneth the humble with salvation.
Let the saints exult in glory; let them sing for joy upon their beds.
Let the high praises of G-d be in their mouth, and a two-edged sword in their hand;
To execute vengeance upon the nations, and chastisements upon the peoples;
To bind their kings with chains, and their nobles with fetters of iron;
To execute upon them the judgment written; He is the glory of all His saints. Hallelujah.

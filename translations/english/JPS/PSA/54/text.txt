For the Leader; with string-music. Maschil of David:
when the Ziphites came and said to Saul: 'Doth not David hide himself with us?'
O G-d, save me by Thy name, and right me by Thy might.
O G-d, hear my prayer; give ear to the words of my mouth.
For strangers are risen up against me, and violent men have sought after my soul; they have not set G-d before them. Selah
Behold, G-d is my helper; the L-rd is for me as the upholder of my soul.
He will requite the evil unto them that lie in wait for me; destroy Thou them in Thy truth.
With a freewill-offering will I sacrifice unto Thee; I will give thanks unto Thy name, O HaShem, for it is good.
For He hath delivered me out of all trouble; and mine eye hath gazed upon mine enemies.

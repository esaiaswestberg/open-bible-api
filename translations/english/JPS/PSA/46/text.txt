For the Leader; a Psalm of the sons of Korah; upon Alamoth. A Song.
G-d is our refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble.
Therefore will we not fear, though the earth do change, and though the mountains be moved into the heart of the seas;
Though the waters thereof roar and foam, though the mountains shake at the swelling thereof. Selah
There is a river, the streams whereof make glad the city of G-d, the holiest dwelling-place of the Most High.
G-d is in the midst of her, she shall not be moved; G-d shall help her, at the approach of morning.
Nations were in tumult, kingdoms were moved; He uttered His voice, the earth melted.
HaShem of hosts is with us; the G-d of Jacob is our high tower. Selah
Come, behold the works of HaShem, who hath made desolations in the earth.
He maketh wars to cease unto the end of the earth; He breaketh the bow, and cutteth the spear in sunder; He burneth the chariots in the fire.
'Let be, and know that I am G-d; I will be exalted among the nations, I will be exalted in the earth.'
HaShem of hosts is with us; the G-d of Jacob is our high tower. Selah

For the Leader; with string-music. A Psalm of David.
Hear my cry, O G-d; attend unto my prayer.
From the end of the earth will I call unto Thee, when my heart fainteth; lead me to a rock that is too high for me.
For Thou hast been a refuge for me, a tower of strength in the face of the enemy.
I will dwell in Thy Tent for ever; I will take refuge in the covert of Thy wings. Selah
For Thou, O G-d, hast heard my vows; Thou hast granted the heritage of those that fear Thy name.
Mayest Thou add days unto the king's days! May his years be as many generations!
May he be enthroned before G-d for ever! Appoint mercy and truth, that they may preserve him.
So will I sing praise unto Thy name for ever, that I may daily perform my vows.

For the Leader; with string-music. A Psalm, a Song.
G-d be gracious unto us, and bless us; may He cause His face to shine toward us; Selah
That Thy way may be known upon earth, Thy salvation among all nations.
Let the peoples give thanks unto Thee, O G-d; let the peoples give thanks unto Thee, all of them.
O let the nations be glad and sing for joy; for Thou wilt judge the peoples with equity, and lead the nations upon earth. Selah
Let the peoples give thanks unto Thee, O G-d; let the peoples give thanks unto Thee, all of them.
The earth hath yielded her increase; may G-d, our own G-d, bless us.
May G-d bless us; and let all the ends of the earth fear Him.

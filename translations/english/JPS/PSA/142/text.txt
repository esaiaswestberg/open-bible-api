Maschil of David, when he was in the cave; a Prayer.
With my voice I cry unto HaShem; with my voice I make supplication unto HaShem.
I pour out my complaint before Him, I declare before Him my trouble;
When my spirit fainteth within me--Thou knowest my path--in the way wherein I walk have they hidden a snare for me.
Look on my right hand, and see, for there is no man that knoweth me; I have no way to flee; no man careth for my soul.
I have cried unto Thee, O HaShem; I have said: 'Thou art my refuge, my portion in the land of the living.'
Attend unto my cry; for I am brought very low; deliver me from my persecutors; for they are too strong for me.
Bring my soul out of prison, that I may give thanks unto Thy name; the righteous shall crown themselves because of me; for Thou wilt deal bountifully with me.

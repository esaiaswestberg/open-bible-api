A Psalm of David. I will give Thee thanks with my whole heart, in the presence of the mighty will I sing praises unto Thee.
I will bow down toward Thy holy temple, and give thanks unto Thy name for Thy mercy and for Thy truth; for Thou hast magnified Thy word above all Thy name.
In the day that I called, Thou didst answer me; Thou didst encourage me in my soul with strength.
All the kings of the earth shall give Thee thanks, O HaShem, for they have heard the words of Thy mouth.
Yea, they shall sing of the ways of HaShem; for great is the glory of HaShem.
For though HaShem be high, yet regardeth He the lowly, and the haughty He knoweth from afar.
Though I walk in the midst of trouble, Thou quickenest me; Thou stretchest forth Thy hand against the wrath of mine enemies, and Thy right hand doth save me.
HaShem will accomplish that which concerneth me; Thy mercy, O HaShem, endureth for ever; forsake not the work of Thine own hands.

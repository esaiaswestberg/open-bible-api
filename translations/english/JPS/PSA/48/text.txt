A Song; a Psalm of the sons of Korah.
Great is HaShem, and highly to be praised, in the city of our G-d, His holy mountain,
Fair in situation, the joy of the whole earth; even mount Zion, the uttermost parts of the north, the city of the great King.
G-d in her palaces hath made Himself known for a stronghold.
For, lo, the kings assembled themselves, they came onward together.
They saw, straightway they were amazed; they were affrighted, they hasted away.
Trembling took hold of them there, pangs, as of a woman in travail.
With the east wind Thou breakest the ships of Tarshish.
As we have heard, so have we seen in the city of HaShem of hosts, in the city of our G-d--G-d establish it for ever. Selah
We have thought on Thy lovingkindness, O G-d, in the midst of Thy temple.
As is Thy name, O G-d, so is Thy praise unto the ends of the earth; Thy right hand is full of righteousness.
Let mount Zion be glad, let the daughters of Judah rejoice, because of Thy judgments.
Walk about Zion, and go round about her; count the towers thereof.
Mark ye well her ramparts, traverse her palaces; that ye may tell it to the generation following.
For such is G-d, our G-d, for ever and ever; He will guide us eternally.

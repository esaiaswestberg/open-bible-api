For the Leader. A Psalm of David.
HaShem answer thee in the day of trouble; the name of the G-d of Jacob set thee up on high;
Send forth thy help from the sanctuary, and support thee out of Zion;
Receive the memorial of all thy meal-offerings, and accept the fat of thy burnt-sacrifice; Selah
Grant thee according to thine own heart, and fulfil all thy counsel.
We will shout for joy in thy victory, and in the name of our G-d we will set up our standards; HaShem fulfil all thy petitions.
Now know I that HaShem saveth His anointed; He will answer him from His holy heaven with the mighty acts of His saving right hand.
Some trust in chariots, and some in horses; but we will make mention of the name of HaShem our G-d.
They are bowed down and fallen; but we are risen, and stand upright.
Save, HaShem; let the King answer us in the day that we call.

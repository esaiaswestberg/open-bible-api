A Song of Ascents. Out of the depths have I called Thee, O HaShem.
L-rd, hearken unto my voice; let Thine ears be attentive to the voice of my supplications.
If Thou, HaShem, shouldest mark iniquities, O L-rd, who could stand?
For with Thee there is forgiveness, that Thou mayest be feared.
I wait for HaShem, my soul doth wait, and in His word do I hope.
My soul waiteth for the L-rd, more than watchmen for the morning; yea, more than watchmen for the morning.
O Israel, hope in HaShem; for with HaShem there is mercy, and with Him is plenteous redemption.
And He will redeem Israel from all his iniquities.

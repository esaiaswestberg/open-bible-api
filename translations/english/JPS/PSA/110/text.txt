A Psalm of David. HaShem saith unto my lord: 'Sit thou at My right hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool.'
The rod of Thy strength HaShem will send out of Zion: 'Rule thou in the midst of thine enemies.'
Thy people offer themselves willingly in the day of thy warfare; in adornments of holiness, from the womb of the dawn, thine is the dew of thy youth.
HaShem hath sworn, and will not repent: 'Thou art a priest for ever after the manner of Melchizedek.'
The L-rd at thy right hand doth crush kings in the day of His wrath.
He will judge among the nations; He filleth it with the dead bodies, He crusheth the head over a wide land.
He will drink of the brook in the way; therefore will he lift up the head.

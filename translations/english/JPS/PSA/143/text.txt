A Psalm of David. O HaShem, hear my prayer, give ear to my supplications; in Thy faithfulness answer me, and in Thy righteousness.
And enter not into judgment with Thy servant; for in Thy sight shall no man living be justified.
For the enemy hath persecuted my soul; he hath crushed my life down to the ground; he hath made me to dwell in darkness, as those that have been long dead.
And my spirit fainteth within me; my heart within me is appalled.
I remember the days of old; I meditate on all Thy doing; I muse on the work of Thy hands.
I spread forth my hands unto Thee; my soul thirsteth after Thee, as a weary land. Selah
Answer me speedily, O HaShem, my spirit faileth; hide not Thy face from me; lest I become like them that go down into the pit.
Cause me to hear Thy lovingkindness in the morning, for in Thee do I trust; cause me to know the way wherein I should walk, for unto Thee have I lifted up my soul.
Deliver me from mine enemies, O HaShem; with Thee have I hidden myself.
Teach me to do Thy will, for Thou art my G-d; let Thy good spirit lead me in an even land.
For Thy name's sake, O HaShem, quicken me; in Thy righteousness bring my soul out of trouble.
And in Thy mercy cut off mine enemies, and destroy all them that harass my soul; for I am Thy servant.

For the Leader; a Psalm for the sons of Korah.
O clap your hands, all ye peoples; shout unto G-d with the voice of triumph.
For HaShem is most high, awful; a great King over all the earth.
He subdueth peoples under us, and nations under our feet.
He chooseth our inheritance for us, the pride of Jacob whom He loveth. Selah
G-d is gone up amidst shouting, HaShem amidst the sound of the horn.
Sing praises to G-d, sing praises; sing praises unto our King, sing praises.
For G-d is the King of all the earth; sing ye praises in a skilful song.
G-d reigneth over the nations; G-d sitteth upon His holy throne.
The princes of the peoples are gathered together, the people of the G-d of Abraham; for unto G-d belong the shields of the earth; He is greatly exalted.

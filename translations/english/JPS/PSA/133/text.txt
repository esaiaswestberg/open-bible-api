A Song of Ascents; of David. Behold, how good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity!
It is like the precious oil upon the head, coming down upon the beard; even Aaron's beard, that cometh down upon the collar of his garments;
Like the dew of Hermon, that cometh down upon the mountains of Zion; for there HaShem commanded the blessing, even life for ever.

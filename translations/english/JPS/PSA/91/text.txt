O thou that dwellest in the covert of the Most High, and abidest in the shadow of the Almighty;
I will say of HaShem, who is my refuge and my fortress, my G-d, in whom I trust,
That He will deliver thee from the snare of the fowler, and from the noisome pestilence.
He will cover thee with His pinions, and under His wings shalt thou take refuge; His truth is a shield and a buckler.
Thou shalt not be afraid of the terror by night, nor of the arrow that flieth by day;
Of the pestilence that walketh in darkness, nor of the destruction that wasteth at noonday.
A thousand may fall at Thy side, and ten thousand at Thy right hand; it shall not come nigh thee.
Only with thine eyes shalt thou behold, and see the recompense of the wicked.
For thou hast made HaShem who is my refuge, even the Most High, thy habitation.
There shall no evil befall thee, neither shall any plague come nigh thy tent.
For He will give His angels charge over thee, to keep thee in all thy ways.
They shall bear thee upon their hands, lest thou dash thy foot against a stone.
Thou shalt tread upon the lion and asp; the young lion and the serpent shalt thou trample under feet.
'Because he hath set his love upon Me, therefore will I deliver him; I will set him on high, because he hath known My name.
He shall call upon Me, and I will answer him; I will be with him in trouble; I will rescue him, and bring him to honour.
With long life will I satisfy him, and make Him to behold My salvation.'

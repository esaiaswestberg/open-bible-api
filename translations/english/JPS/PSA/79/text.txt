A Psalm of Asaph. O G-d, the heathen are come into Thine inheritance; they have defiled Thy holy temple; they have made Jerusalem into heaps.
They have given the dead bodies of Thy servants to be food unto the fowls of the heaven, the flesh of Thy saints unto the beasts of the earth.
They have shed their blood like water round about Jerusalem, with none to bury them.
We are become a taunt to our neighbours, a scorn and derision to them that are round about us.
How long, O HaShem, wilt Thou be angry for ever? How long will Thy jealousy burn like fire?
Pour out Thy wrath upon the nations that know Thee not, and upon the kingdoms that call not upon Thy name.
For they have devoured Jacob, and laid waste his habitation.
Remember not against us the iniquities of our forefathers; let Thy compassions speedily come to meet us; for we are brought very low.
Help us, O G-d of our salvation, for the sake of the glory of Thy name; and deliver us, and forgive our sins, for Thy name's sake.
Wherefore should the nations say: 'Where is their G-d?' Let the avenging of Thy servants' blood that is shed be made known among the nations in our sight.
Let the groaning of the prisoner come before Thee; according to the greatness of Thy power set free those that are appointed to death;
And render unto our neighbours sevenfold into their bosom their reproach, wherewith they have reproached Thee, O L-rd.
So we that are Thy people and the flock of Thy pasture will give Thee thanks for ever; we will tell of Thy praise to all generations.

A Psalm of David; when he changed his demeanour before Abimelech, who drove him away, and he departed.
I will bless HaShem at all times; His praise shall continually be in my mouth.
My soul shall glory in HaShem; the humble shall hear thereof, and be glad.
O magnify HaShem with me, and let us exalt His name together.
I sought HaShem, and He answered me, and delivered me from all my fears.
They looked unto Him, and were radiant; and their faces shall never be abashed.
This poor man cried, and HaShem heard, and saved him out of all his troubles.
The angel of HaShem encampeth round about them that fear Him, and delivereth them.
O consider and see that HaShem is good; happy is the man that taketh refuge in Him.
O fear HaShem, ye His holy ones; for there is no want to them that fear Him.
The young lions do lack, and suffer hunger; but they that seek HaShem want not any good thing.
Come, ye children, hearken unto me; I will teach you the fear of HaShem.
Who is the man that desireth life, and loveth days, that he may see good therein?
Keep thy tongue from evil, and thy lips from speaking guile.
Depart from evil, and do good; seek peace, and pursue it.
The eyes of HaShem are toward the righteous, and His ears are open unto their cry.
The face of HaShem is against them that do evil, to cut off the remembrance of them from the earth.
They cried, and HaShem heard, and delivered them out of all their troubles.
HaShem is nigh unto them that are of a broken heart, and saveth such as are of a contrite spirit.
Many are the ills of the righteous, but HaShem delivereth him out of them all.
He keepeth all his bones; not one of them is broken.
Evil shall kill the wicked; and they that hate the righteous shall be held guilty.
HaShem redeemeth the soul of His servants; and none of them that take refuge in Him shall be desolate.

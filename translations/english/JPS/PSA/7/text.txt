Shiggaion of David, which he sang unto HaShem, concerning Cush a Benjamite.
O HaShem my G-d, in Thee have I taken refuge; save me from all them that pursue me, and deliver me;
Lest he tear my soul like a lion, rending it in pieces, while there is none to deliver.
O HaShem my G-d, if I have done this; if there be iniquity in my hands;
If I have requited him that did evil unto me, or spoiled mine adversary unto emptiness;
Let the enemy pursue my soul, and overtake it, and tread my life down to the earth; yea, let him lay my glory in the dust. Selah
Arise, O HaShem, in Thine anger, lift up Thyself in indignation against mine adversaries; yea, awake for me at the judgment which Thou hast commanded.
And let the congregation of the peoples compass Thee about, and over them return Thou on high.
O HaShem, who ministerest judgment to the peoples, judge me, O HaShem, according to my righteousness, and according to mine integrity that is in me.
Oh that a full measure of evil might come upon the wicked, and that Thou wouldest establish the righteous; for the righteous G-d trieth the heart and reins.
My shield is with G-d, who saveth the upright in heart.
G-d is a righteous judge, yea, a G-d that hath indignation every day:
If a man turn not, He will whet His sword, He hath bent His bow, and made it ready;
He hath also prepared for him the weapons of death, yea, His arrows which He made sharp.
Behold, he travaileth with iniquity; yea, he conceiveth mischief, and bringeth forth falsehood.
He hath digged a pit, and hollowed it, and is fallen into the ditch which he made.
His mischief shall return upon his own head, and his violence shall come down upon his own pate.
I will give thanks unto HaShem according to His righteousness; and will sing praise to the name of HaShem Most High.

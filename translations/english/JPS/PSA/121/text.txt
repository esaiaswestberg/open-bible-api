A Song of Ascents. I will lift up mine eyes unto the mountains: from whence shall my help come?
My help cometh from HaShem, who made heaven and earth.
He will not suffer thy foot to be moved; He that keepeth thee will not slumber.
Behold, He that keepeth Israel doth neither slumber nor sleep.
HaShem is thy keeper; HaShem is thy shade upon thy right hand.
The sun shall not smite thee by day, nor the moon by night.
HaShem shall keep thee from all evil; He shall keep thy soul.
HaShem shall guard thy going out and thy coming in, from this time forth and for ever.

For the Leader; for Jeduthun. A Psalm of Asaph.
I will lift up my voice unto G-d, an cry; I will lift up my voice unto G-d, that He may give ear unto me.
In the day of my trouble I seek the L-rd; with my hand uplifted, mine eye streameth in the night without ceasing; my soul refuseth to be comforted.
When I think thereon, O G-d, I must moan; when I muse thereon, my spirit fainteth. Selah
Thou holdest fast the lids of mine eyes; I am troubled, and cannot speak.
I have pondered the days of old, the years of ancient times.
In the night I will call to remembrance my song; I will commune with mine own heart; and my spirit maketh diligent search:
'Will the L-rd cast off for ever? and will He be favourable no more?
Is His mercy clean gone for ever? Is His promise come to an end for evermore?
Hath G-d forgotten to be gracious? Hath He in anger shut up his compassions?' Selah
And I say: 'This is my weakness, that the right hand of the Most High could change.
I will make mention of the deeds of HaShem; yea, I will remember Thy wonders of old.
I will meditate also upon all Thy work, and muse on Thy doings.'
O G-d, Thy way is in holiness; who is a great god like unto G-d?
Thou art the G-d that doest wonders; Thou hast made known Thy strength among the peoples.
Thou hast with Thine arm redeemed Thy people, the sons of Jacob and Joseph. Selah
The waters saw Thee, O G-d; the waters saw Thee, they were in pain; the depths also trembled.
The clouds flooded forth waters; the skies sent out a sound; Thine arrows also went abroad.
The voice of Thy thunder was in the whirlwind; the lightnings lighted up the world; the earth trembled and shook.
Thy way was in the sea, and Thy path in the great waters, and Thy footsteps were not known.
Thou didst lead Thy people like a flock, by the hand of Moses and Aaron.

And in that day thou shalt say: 'I will give thanks unto Thee, O HaShem; for though Thou was angry with me, Thine anger is turned away, and Thou comfortest me.
Behold, G-d is my salvation; I will trust, and will not be afraid; for GOD HaShem is my strength and song; and He is become my salvation.'
Therefore with joy shall ye draw water out of the wells of salvation.
And in that day shall ye say: 'Give thanks unto HaShem, proclaim His name, declare His doings among the peoples, make mention that His name is exalted.
Sing unto HaShem; for He hath done gloriously; this is made known in all the earth.
Cry aloud and shout, thou inhabitant of Zion, for great is the Holy One of Israel in the midst of thee.'

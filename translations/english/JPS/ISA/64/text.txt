As when fire kindleth the brush-wood, and the fire causeth the waters to boil; to make Thy name known to Thine adversaries, that the nations might tremble at Thy presence,
When Thou didst tremendous things which we looked not for--Oh that Thou wouldest come down, that the mountains might quake at Thy presence!--
And whereof from of old men have not heard, nor perceived by the ear, neither hath the eye seen a G-d beside Thee, who worketh for him that waiteth for Him.
Thou didst take away him that joyfully worked righteousness, those that remembered Thee in Thy ways--behold, Thou wast wroth, and we sinned--upon them have we stayed of old, that we might be saved.
And we are all become as one that is unclean, and all our righteousnesses are as a polluted garment; and we all do fade as a leaf, and our iniquities, like the wind, take us away.
And there is none that calleth upon Thy name, that stirreth up himself to take hold of Thee; for Thou hast hid Thy face from us, and hast consumed us by means of our iniquities.
But now, O HaShem, Thou art our Father; we are the clay, and Thou our potter, and we all are the work of Thy hand.
Be not wroth very sore, O HaShem, neither remember iniquity for ever; behold, look, we beseech Thee, we are all Thy people.
Thy holy cities are become a wilderness, Zion is become a wilderness, Jerusalem a desolation.
Our holy and our beautiful house, where our fathers praised Thee, is burned with fire; and all our pleasant things are laid waste.
Wilt Thou refrain Thyself for these things, O HaShem? Wilt Thou hold Thy peace, and afflict us very sore?

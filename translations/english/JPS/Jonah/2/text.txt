And HaShem prepared a great fish to swallow up Jonah; and Jonah was in the belly of the fish three days and three nights.
Then Jonah prayed unto HaShem his G-d out of the fish's belly.
And he said: I called out of mine affliction unto HaShem, and He answered me; out of the belly of the nether-world cried I, and Thou heardest my voice.
For Thou didst cast me into the depth, in the heart of the seas, and the flood was round about me; all Thy waves and Thy billows passed over me.
And I said: 'I am cast out from before Thine eyes'; yet I will look again toward Thy holy temple.
The waters compassed me about, even to the soul; the deep was round about me; the weeds were wrapped about my head.
I went down to the bottoms of the mountains; the earth with her bars closed upon me for ever; yet hast Thou brought up my life from the pit, O HaShem my G-d.
When my soul fainted within me, I remembered HaShem; and my prayer came in unto Thee, into Thy holy temple.
They that regard lying vanities forsake their own mercy.
But I will sacrifice unto Thee with the voice of thanksgiving; that which I have vowed I will pay. Salvation is of HaShem.
And HaShem spoke unto the fish, and it vomited out Jonah upon the dry land.

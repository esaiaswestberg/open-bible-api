And HaShem spoke unto Moses, saying:
'Make thee two trumpets of silver; of beaten work shalt thou make them; and they shall be unto thee for the calling of the congregation, and for causing the camps to set forward.
And when they shall blow with them, all the congregation shall gather themselves unto thee at the door of the tent of meeting.
And if they blow but with one, then the princes, the heads of the thousands of Israel, shall gather themselves unto thee.
And when ye blow an alarm, the camps that lie on the east side shall take their journey.
And when ye blow an alarm the second time, the camps that lie on the south side shall set forward; they shall blow an alarm for their journeys.
But when the assembly is to be gathered together, ye shall blow, but ye shall not sound an alarm.
And the sons of Aaron, the priests, shall blow with the trumpets; and they shall be to you for a statute for ever throughout your generations.
And when ye go to war in your land against the adversary that oppresseth you, then ye shall sound an alarm with the trumpets; and ye shall be remembered before HaShem your G-d, and ye shall be saved from your enemies.
Also in the day of your gladness, and in your appointed seasons, and in your new moons, ye shall blow with the trumpets over your burnt-offerings, and over the sacrifices of your peace-offerings; and they shall be to you for a memorial before your G-d: I am HaShem your G-d.'

And he said unto him: 'I will not go; but I will depart to mine own land, and to my kindred.'
And he said: 'Leave us not, I pray thee; forasmuch as thou knowest how we are to encamp in the wilderness, and thou shalt be to us instead of eyes.
And it shall be, if thou go with us, yea, it shall be, that what good soever HaShem shall do unto us, the same will we do unto thee.'

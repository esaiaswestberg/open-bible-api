These are the stages of the children of Israel, by which they went forth out of the land of Egypt by their hosts under the hand of Moses and Aaron.
And Moses wrote their goings forth, stage by stage, by the commandment of HaShem; and these are their stages at their goings forth.
And they journeyed from Rameses in the first month, on the fifteenth day of the first month; on the morrow after the passover the children of Israel went out with a high hand in the sight of all the Egyptians,
while the Egyptians were burying them that HaShem had smitten among them, even all their first-born; upon their gods also HaShem executed judgments.

And Aaron the priest went up into mount Hor at the commandment of HaShem, and died there, in the fortieth year after the children of Israel were come out of the land of Egypt, in the fifth month, on the first day of the month.
And Aaron was a hundred and twenty and three years old when he died in mount Hor.

And they pitched by the Jordan, from Beth-jeshimoth even unto Abel-shittim in the plains of Moab.
And HaShem spoke unto Moses in the plains of Moab by the Jordan at Jericho, saying:
'Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them: When ye pass over the Jordan into the land of Canaan,
then ye shall drive out all the inhabitants of the land from before you, and destroy all their figured stones, and destroy all their molten images, and demolish all their high places.
And ye shall drive out the inhabitants of the land, and dwell therein; for unto you have I given the land to possess it.
And ye shall inherit the land by lot according to your families--to the more ye shall give the more inheritance, and to the fewer thou shalt give the less inheritance; wheresoever the lot falleth to any man, that shall be his; according to the tribes of your fathers shall ye inherit.
But if ye will not drive out the inhabitants of the land from before you, then shall those that ye let remain of them be as thorns in your eyes, and as pricks in your sides, and they shall harass you in the land wherein ye dwell.
And it shall come to pass, that as I thought to do unto them, so will I do unto you.

For the Leader. A Psalm of David the servant of HaShem.
Transgression speaketh to the wicked, methinks-- there is no fear of G-d before his eyes.
For it flattereth him in his eyes, until his iniquity be found, and he be hated.
The words of his mouth are iniquity and deceit; he hath left off to be wise, to do good.
He deviseth iniquity upon his bed; he setteth himself in a way that is not good; he abhorreth not evil.
Thy lovingkindness, O HaShem, is in the heavens; Thy faithfulness reacheth unto the skies.
Thy righteousness is like the mighty mountains; Thy judgments are like the great deep; man and beast Thou preservest, O HaShem.
How precious is Thy lovingkindness, O G-d! and the children of men take refuge in the shadow of Thy wings.
They are abundantly satisfied with the fatness of Thy house; and Thou makest them drink of the river of Thy pleasures.
For with Thee is the fountain of life; in Thy light do we see light.
O continue Thy lovingkindness unto them that know Thee; and Thy righteousness to the upright in heart.
Let not the foot of pride overtake me, and let not the hand of the wicked drive me away.
There are the workers of iniquity fallen; they are thrust down, and are not able to rise.

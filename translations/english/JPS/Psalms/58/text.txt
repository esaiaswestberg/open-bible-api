For the Leader; Al-tashheth. A Psalm of David; Michtam.
Do ye indeed speak as a righteous company? Do ye judge with equity the sons of men?
Yea, in heart ye work wickedness; ye weigh out in the earth the violence of your hands.
The wicked are estranged from the womb; the speakers of lies go astray as soon as they are born.
Their venom is like the venom of a serpent; they are like the deaf asp that stoppeth her ear;
Which hearkeneth not to the voice of charmers, or of the most cunning binder of spells.
Break their teeth, O G-d, in their mouth; break out the cheek-teeth of the young lions, O HaShem.
Let them melt away as water that runneth apace; when he aimeth his arrows, let them be as though they were cut off.
Let them be as a snail which melteth and passeth away; like the untimely births of a woman, that have not seen the sun.
Before your pots can feel the thorns, He will sweep it away with a whirlwind, the raw and the burning alike.
The righteous shall rejoice when he seeth the vengeance; he shall wash his feet in the blood of the wicked.
And men shall say: 'Verily there is a reward for the righteous; verily there is a G-d that judgeth in the earth.'

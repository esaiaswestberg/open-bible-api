Hallelujah. Praise HaShem, O my soul.
I will praise HaShem while I live; I will sing praises unto my G-d while I have my being.
Put not your trust in princes, nor in the son of man, in whom there is no help.
His breath goeth forth, he returneth to his dust; in that very day his thoughts perish.
Happy is he whose help is the G-d of Jacob, whose hope is in HaShem his G-d,
Who made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is; who keepeth truth for ever;
Who executeth justice for the oppressed; who giveth bread to the hungry. HaShem looseth the prisoners;
HaShem openeth the eyes of the blind; HaShem raiseth up them that are bowed down; HaShem loveth the righteous;
HaShem preserveth the strangers; He upholdeth the fatherless and the widow; but the way of the wicked He maketh crooked.
HaShem will reign for ever, Thy G-d, O Zion, unto all generations. Hallelujah.

For the Leader; Maschil of the sons of Korah.
As the hart panteth after the water brooks, so panteth my soul after Thee, O G-d.
My soul thirsteth for G-d, for the living G-d: 'When shall I come and appear before G-d?'
My tears have been my food day and night, while they say unto me all the day: 'Where is Thy G-d?'
These things I remember, and pour out my soul within me, how I passed on with the throng, and led them to the house of G-d, with the voice of joy and praise, a multitude keeping holyday.
Why art thou cast down, O my soul? and why moanest thou within me? Hope thou in G-d; for I shall yet praise Him for the salvation of His countenance.
O my G-d, my soul is cast down within me; therefore do I remember Thee from the land of Jordan, and the Hermons, from the hill Mizar.
Deep calleth unto deep at the voice of Thy cataracts; all Thy waves and Thy billows are gone over me.
By day HaShem will command His lovingkindness, and in the night His song shall be with me, even a prayer unto the G-d of my life.
I will say unto G-d my Rock: 'Why hast Thou forgotten me? Why go I mourning under the oppression of the enemy?'
As with a crushing in my bones, mine adversaries taunt me; while they say unto me all the day: 'Where is Thy G-d?'
Why art thou cast down, O my soul? and why moanest thou within me? Hope thou in G-d; for I shall yet praise Him, the salvation of my countenance, and my G-d.

A Song, a Psalm of David.
My heart is steadfast, O G-d; I will sing, yea, I will sing praises, even with my glory.
Awake, psaltery and harp; I will awake the dawn.
I will give thanks unto Thee, O HaShem, among the peoples; and I will sing praises unto Thee among the nations.
For Thy mercy is great above the heavens, and Thy truth reacheth unto the skies.
Be Thou exalted, O G-d, above the heavens; and Thy glory be above all the earth.
That Thy beloved may be delivered, save with Thy right hand, and answer me.
G-d spoke in His holiness, that I would exult; that I would divide Shechem, and mete out the valley of Succoth.
Gilead is mine, Manasseh is mine; Ephraim also is the defence of my head; Judah is my sceptre.
Moab is my washpot; upon Edom do I cast my shoe; over Philistia do I cry aloud.
Who will bring me into the fortified city? Who will lead me unto Edom?
Hast not Thou cast us off, O G-d? and Thou goest not forth, O G-d, with our hosts?
Give us help against the adversary; for vain is the help of man.
Through G-d we shall do valiantly; for He it is that will tread down our adversaries.

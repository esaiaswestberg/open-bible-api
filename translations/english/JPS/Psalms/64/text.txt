For the Leader. A Psalm of David.
Hear my voice, O G-d, in my complaint; preserve my life from the terror of the enemy.
Hide me from the council of evil-doers; from the tumult of the workers of iniquity;
Who have whet their tongue like a sword, and have aimed their arrow, a poisoned word;
That they may shoot in secret places at the blameless; suddenly do they shoot at him, and fear not.
They encourage one another in an evil matter; they converse of laying snares secretly; they ask, who would see them.
They search out iniquities, they have accomplished a diligent search; even in the inward thought of every one, and the deep heart.
But G-d doth shoot at them with an arrow suddenly; thence are their wounds.
So they make their own tongue a stumbling unto themselves; all that see them shake the head. 10 And all men fear; and they declare the work of G-d, and understand His doing.

The righteous shall be glad in HaShem, and shall take refuge in Him; and all the upright in heart shall glory.

Hallelujah; for it is good to sing praises unto our G-d; for it is pleasant, and praise is comely.
HaShem doth build up Jerusalem, He gathereth together the dispersed of Israel;
Who healeth the broken in heart, and bindeth up their wounds.
He counteth the number of the stars; He giveth them all their names.
Great is our L-rd, and mighty in power; His understanding is infinite.
HaShem upholdeth the humble; He bringeth the wicked down to the ground.
Sing unto HaShem with thanksgiving, sing praises upon the harp unto our G-d;
Who covereth the heaven with clouds, who prepareth rain for the earth, who maketh the mountains to spring with grass.
He giveth to the beast his food, and to the young ravens which cry.
He delighteth not in the strength of the horse; He taketh no pleasure in the legs of a man.
HaShem taketh pleasure in them that fear Him, in those that wait for His mercy.
Glorify HaShem, O Jerusalem; praise thy G-d, O Zion.
For He hath made strong the bars of thy gates; He hath blessed thy children within thee.
He maketh thy borders peace; He giveth thee in plenty the fat of wheat.
He sendeth out His commandment upon earth; His word runneth very swiftly.
He giveth snow like wool; He scattereth the hoar-frost like ashes.
He casteth forth His ice like crumbs; who can stand before His cold?
He sendeth forth His word, and melteth them; He causeth His wind to blow, and the waters flow.
He declareth His word unto Jacob, His statutes and His ordinances unto Israel.
He hath not dealt so with any nation; and as for His ordinances, they have not known them. Hallelujah.

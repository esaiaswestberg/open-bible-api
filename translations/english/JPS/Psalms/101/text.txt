A Psalm of David. I will sing of mercy and justice; unto Thee, O HaShem, will I sing praises.
I will give heed unto the way of integrity; oh when wilt Thou come unto me? I will walk within my house in the integrity of my heart.
I will set no base thing before mine eyes; I hate the doing of things crooked; it shall not cleave unto me.
A perverse heart shall depart from me; I will know no evil thing.
Whoso slandereth his neighbour in secret, him will I destroy; whoso is haughty of eye and proud of heart, him will I not suffer.
Mine eyes are upon the faithful of the land, that they may dwell with me; he that walketh in a way of integrity, he shall minister unto me.
He that worketh deceit shall not dwell within my house; he that speaketh falsehood shall not be established before mine eyes.
Morning by morning will I destroy all the wicked of the land; to cut off all the workers of iniquity from the city of HaShem.

For the Leader; with string-music. A Psalm of Asaph, a Song.
In Judah is G-d known; His name is great in Israel.
In Salem also is set His tabernacle, and His dwelling-place in Zion.
There He broke the fiery shafts of the bow; the shield, and the sword, and the battle. Selah
Glorious art Thou and excellent, coming down from the mountains of prey.
The stout-hearted are bereft of sense, they sleep their sleep; and none of the men of might have found their hands.
At Thy rebuke, O G-d of Jacob, they are cast into a dead sleep, the riders also and the horses.
Thou, even Thou, art terrible; and who may stand in Thy sight when once Thou art angry?
Thou didst cause sentence to be heard from heaven; the earth feared, and was still,
When G-d arose to judgment, to save all the humble of the earth. Selah
Surely the wrath of man shall praise Thee; the residue of wrath shalt Thou gird upon Thee.
Vow, and pay unto HaShem your G-d; let all that are round about Him bring presents unto Him that is to be feared;
He minisheth the spirit of princes; He is terrible to the kings of the earth.

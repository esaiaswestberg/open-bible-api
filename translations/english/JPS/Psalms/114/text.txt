When Israel came forth out of Egypt, the house of Jacob from a people of strange language;
Judah became His sanctuary, Israel His dominion.
The sea saw it, and fled; the Jordan turned backward.
The mountains skipped like rams, the hills like young sheep.
What aileth thee, O thou sea, that thou fleest? thou Jordan, that thou turnest backward?
Ye mountains, that ye skip like rams; ye hills, like young sheep?
Tremble, thou earth, at the presence of the L-rd, at the presence of the G-d of Jacob;
Who turned the rock into a pool of water, the flint into a fountain of waters.

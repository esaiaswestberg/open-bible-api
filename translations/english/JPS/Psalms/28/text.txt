A Psalm of David. Unto thee, O HaShem, do I call; my Rock, be not Thou deaf unto me; lest, if Thou be silent unto me, I become like them that go down into the pit.
Hear the voice of my supplications, when I cry unto Thee, when I lift up my hands toward Thy holy Sanctuary.
Draw me not away with the wicked, and with the workers of iniquity; who speak peace with their neighbours, but evil is in their hearts.
Give them according to their deeds, and according to the evil of their endeavours; give them after the work of their hands; render to them their desert.
Because they give no heed to the works of HaShem, nor to the operation of His hands; He will break them down and not build them up.
Blessed be HaShem, because He hath heard the voice of my supplications.
HaShem is my strength and my shield, in Him hath my heart trusted, and I am helped; therefore my heart greatly rejoiceth, and with my song will I praise Him.
HaShem is a strength unto them; and He is a stronghold of salvation to His anointed.
Save Thy people, and bless Thine inheritance; and tend them, and carry them for ever.

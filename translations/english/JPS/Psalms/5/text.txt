For the Leader; upon the Nehiloth. A Psalm of David.
Give ear to my words, O HaShem, consider my meditation.
Hearken unto the voice of my cry, my King, and my G-d; for unto Thee do I pray.
O HaShem, in the morning shalt Thou hear my voice; in the morning will I order my prayer unto Thee, and will look forward.
For Thou art not a G-d that hath pleasure in wickedness; evil shall not sojourn with Thee.
The boasters shall not stand in Thy sight; Thou hatest all workers of iniquity.
Thou destroyest them that speak falsehood; HaShem abhorreth the man of blood and of deceit.
But as for me, in the abundance of Thy lovingkindness will I come into Thy house; I will bow down toward Thy holy temple in the fear of Thee.
O HaShem, lead me in Thy righteousness because of them that lie in wait for me; make Thy way straight before my face.
For there is no sincerity in their mouth; their inward part is a yawning gulf, their throat is an open sepulchre; they make smooth their tongue.
Hold them guilty, O G-d, let them fall by their own counsels; cast them down in the multitude of their transgressions; for they have rebelled against Thee.
So shall all those that take refuge in Thee rejoice, they shall ever shout for joy, and Thou shalt shelter them; let them also that love Thy name exult in Thee.
For Thou dost bless the righteous; O HaShem, Thou dost encompass him with favour as with a shield.

For the Leader; upon Mahalath. Maschil of David.
The fool hath said in his heart: 'There is no G-d'; they have dealt corruptly, and have done abominable iniquity; there is none that doeth good.
G-d looked forth from heaven upon the children of men, to see if there were any man of understanding, that did seek after G-d.
Every one of them is unclean, they are together become impure; there is none that doeth good, no, not one.
'Shall not the workers of iniquity know it, who eat up My people as they eat bread, and call not upon G-d?'
There are they in great fear, where no fear was; for G-d hath scattered the bones of him that encampeth against thee; Thou hast put them to shame, because G-d hath rejected them.
Oh that the salvation of Israel were come out of Zion! When G-d turneth the captivity of His people, let Jacob rejoice, let Israel be glad.

For the Leader. A Psalm of David.
Happy is he that considereth the poor; HaShem will deliver him in the day of evil.
HaShem preserve him, and keep him alive, let him be called happy in the land; and deliver not Thou him unto the greed of his enemies.
HaShem support him upon the bed of illness; mayest Thou turn all his lying down in his sickness.
As for me, I said: 'O HaShem, be gracious unto me; heal my soul; for I have sinned against Thee.'
Mine enemies speak evil of me: 'When shall he die, and his name perish?'
And if one come to see me, he speaketh falsehood; his heart gathereth iniquity to itself; when he goeth abroad, he speaketh of it.
All that hate me whisper together against me, against me do they devise my hurt:
'An evil thing cleaveth fast unto him; and now that he lieth, he shall rise up no more.'
Yea, mine own familiar friend, in whom I trusted, who did eat of my bread, hath lifted up his heel against me.
But Thou, O HaShem, be gracious unto me, and raise me up, that I may requite them.
By this I know that Thou delightest in me, that mine enemy doth not triumph over me.
And as for me, Thou upholdest me because of mine integrity, and settest me before Thy face for ever.
Blessed be HaShem, the G-d of Israel, from everlasting and to everlasting. Amen, and Amen. BOOK II

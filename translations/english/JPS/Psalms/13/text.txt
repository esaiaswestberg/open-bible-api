For the Leader. A Psalm of David.
How long, O HaShem, wilt Thou forget me for ever? How long wilt Thou hide Thy face from me?
How long shall I take counsel in my soul, having sorrow in my heart by day? How long shall mine enemy be exalted over me?
Behold Thou, and answer me, O HaShem my G-d; lighten mine eyes, lest I sleep the sleep of death;
Lest mine enemy say: 'I have prevailed against him'; lest mine adversaries rejoice when I am moved.
But as for me, in Thy mercy do I trust; my heart shall rejoice in Thy salvation. I will sing unto HaShem, because He hath dealt bountifully with me.

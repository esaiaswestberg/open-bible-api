A Psalm of Asaph. G-d standeth in the congregation of G-d; in the midst of the judges He judgeth:
'How long will ye judge unjustly, and respect the persons of the wicked? Selah
Judge the poor and fatherless; do justice to the afflicted and destitute.
Rescue the poor and needy; deliver them out of the hand of the wicked.
They know not, neither do they understand; they go about in darkness; all the foundations of the earth are moved.
I said: Ye are godlike beings, and all of you sons of the Most High.
Nevertheless ye shall die like men, and fall like one of the princes.'
Arise, O G-d, judge the earth; for Thou shalt possess all nations.

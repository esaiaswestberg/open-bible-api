For the Leader; on the Sheminith. A Psalm of David.
Help, HaShem; for the godly man ceaseth; for the faithful fail from among the children of men.
They speak falsehood every one with his neighbour; with flattering lip, and with a double heart, do they speak.
May HaShem cut off all flattering lips, the tongue that speaketh proud things!
Who have said: 'Our tongue will we make mighty; our lips are with us: who is lord over us?'
'For the oppression of the poor, for the sighing of the needy, now will I arise', saith HaShem; 'I will set him in safety at whom they puff.'
The words of HaShem are pure words, as silver tried in a crucible on the earth, refined seven times.
Thou wilt keep them, O HaShem; Thou wilt preserve us from this generation for ever.
The wicked walk on every side, when vileness is exalted among the sons of men.

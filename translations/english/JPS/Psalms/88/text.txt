A Song, a Psalm of the sons of Korah; for the Leader; upon Mahalath Leannoth. Maschil of Heman the Ezrahite.
O HaShem, G-d of my salvation, what time I cry in the night before Thee,
Let my prayer come before Thee, incline Thine ear unto my cry.
For my soul is sated with troubles, and my life draweth nigh unto the grave.
I am counted with them that go down into the pit; I am become as a man that hath no help;
Set apart among the dead, like the slain that lie in the grave, whom Thou rememberest no more; and they are cut off from Thy hand.
Thou hast laid me in the nether-most pit, in dark places, in the deeps.
Thy wrath lieth hard upon me, and all Thy waves Thou pressest down. Selah
Thou hast put mine acquaintance far from me; Thou hast made me an abomination unto them; I am shut up, and I cannot come forth.
Mine eye languisheth by reason of affliction; I have called upon Thee, O HaShem, every day, I have spread forth my hands unto Thee.
Wilt Thou work wonders for the dead? Or shall the shades arise and give Thee thanks? Selah
Shall Thy mercy be declared in the grave? or Thy faithfulness in destruction?
Shall Thy wonders be known in the dark? and Thy righteousness in the land of forgetfulness?
But as for me, unto Thee, O HaShem, do I cry, and in the morning doth my prayer come to meet Thee.
HaShem, why castest Thou off my soul? Why hidest Thou Thy face from me?
I am afflicted and at the point of death from my youth up; I have borne Thy terrors, I am distracted.
Thy fierce wrath is gone over me; Thy terrors have cut me off.
They came round about me like water all the day; they compassed me about together.
Friend and companion hast Thou put far from me, and mine acquaintance into darkness.

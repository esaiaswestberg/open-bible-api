For the Leader. A Psalm of David;
When Nathan the prophet came unto him, after he had gone in to Bath-sheba.
Be gracious unto me, O G-d, according to Thy mercy; according to the multitude of Thy compassions blot out my transgressions.
Wash me thoroughly from mine iniquity, and cleanse me from my sin.
For I know my transgressions; and my sin is ever before me.
Against Thee, Thee only, have I sinned, and done that which is evil in Thy sight; that Thou mayest be justified when Thou speakest, and be in the right when Thou judgest.
Behold, I was brought forth in iniquity, and in sin did my mother conceive me.
Behold, Thou desirest truth in the inward parts; make me, therefore, to know wisdom in mine inmost heart.
Purge me with hyssop, and I shall be clean; wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.
Make me to hear joy and gladness; that the bones which Thou hast crushed may rejoice.
Hide Thy face from my sins, and blot out all mine iniquities.
Create me a clean heart, O G-d; and renew a stedfast spirit within me.
Cast me not away from Thy presence; and take not Thy holy spirit from me.
Restore unto me the joy of Thy salvation; and let a willing spirit uphold me.
Then will I teach transgressors Thy ways; and sinners shall return unto Thee.
Deliver me from bloodguiltiness, O G-d, Thou G-d of my salvation; so shall my tongue sing aloud of Thy righteousness.
O L-rd, open Thou my lips; and my mouth shall declare Thy praise.
For Thou delightest not in sacrifice, else would I give it; Thou hast no pleasure in burnt-offering.
The sacrifices of G-d are a broken spirit; a broken and a contrite heart, O G-d, Thou wilt not despise.
Do good in Thy favour unto Zion; build Thou the walls of Jerusalem.
Then wilt Thou delight in the sacrifices of righteousness, in burnt-offering and whole offering; then will they offer bullocks upon Thine altar.

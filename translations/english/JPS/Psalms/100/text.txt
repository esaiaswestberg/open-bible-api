A Psalm of thanksgiving. Shout unto HaShem, all the earth.
Serve HaShem with gladness; come before His presence with singing.
Know ye that HaShem He is G-d; it is He that hath made us, and we our His, His people, and the flock of His pasture.
Enter into His gates with thanksgiving, and into His courts with praise; give thanks unto Him, and bless His name.
For HaShem is good; His mercy endureth for ever; and His faithfulness unto all generations.

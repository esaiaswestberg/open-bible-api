A Psalm of David, when he fled from Absalom his son.
HaShem, how many are mine adversaries become! Many are they that rise up against me.
Many there are that say of my soul: 'There is no salvation for him in G-d.' Selah
But thou, O HaShem, art a shield about me; my glory, and the lifter up of my head.
With my voice I call unto HaShem, and He answereth me out of His holy mountain. Selah
I lay me down, and I sleep; I awake, for HaShem sustaineth me.
I am not afraid of ten thousands of people, that have set themselves against me round about.
Arise, O HaShem; save me, O my G-d; for Thou hast smitten all mine enemies upon the cheek, Thou hast broken the teeth of the wicked.
Salvation belongeth unto HaShem; Thy blessing be upon Thy people. Selah

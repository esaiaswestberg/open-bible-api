For the Leader. A Psalm. A Song of David.
Praise waiteth for Thee, O G-d, in Zion; and unto Thee the vow is performed.
O Thou that hearest prayer, unto Thee doth all flesh come.
The tale of iniquities is too heavy for me; as for our transgressions, Thou wilt pardon them.
Happy is the man whom Thou choosest, and bringest near, that he may dwell in Thy courts; may we be satisfied with the goodness of Thy house, the holy place of Thy temple!
With wondrous works dost Thou answer us in righteousness, O G-d of our salvation; Thou the confidence of all the ends of the earth, and of the far distant seas;
Who by Thy strength settest fast the mountains, who art girded about with might;
Who stillest the roaring of the seas, the roaring of their waves, and the tumult of the peoples;
So that they that dwell in the uttermost parts stand in awe of Thy signs; Thou makest the outgoings of the morning and evening to rejoice.
Thou hast remembered the earth, and watered her, greatly enriching her, with the river of G-d that is full of water; Thou preparest them corn, for so preparest Thou her.
Watering her ridges abundantly, settling down the furrows thereof, Thou makest her soft with showers; Thou blessest the growth thereof.
Thou crownest the year with Thy goodness; and Thy paths drop fatness.
The pastures of the wilderness do drop; and the hills are girded with joy.
The meadows are clothed with flocks; the valleys also are covered over with corn; they shout for joy, yea, they sing.

For the Leader; upon the Gittith. A Psalm of David.
O HaShem, our L-rd, how glorious is Thy name in all the earth! whose majesty is rehearsed above the heavens.
Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings hast Thou founded strength, because of Thine adversaries; that Thou mightest still the enemy and the avenger.
When I behold Thy heavens, the work of Thy fingers, the moon and the stars, which Thou hast established;
What is man, that Thou art mindful of him? and the son of man, that Thou thinkest of him?
Yet Thou hast made him but little lower than the angels, and hast crowned him with glory and honour.
Thou hast made him to have dominion over the works of Thy hands; Thou hast put all things under His feet:
Sheep and oxen, all of them, yea, and the beasts of the field;
The fowl of the air, and the fish of the sea; whatsoever passeth through the paths of the seas.
O HaShem, our L-rd, how glorious is Thy name in all the earth!

Hear, OGod, my cry; attend unto my prayer.
From the end of the earth will I call unto thee, when my heart is overwhelmed: thou wilt lead me on to a rock which is too high for me.
For thou hast been a refuge for me, a strong tower from before the enemy.
I will sojourn in thy tent for ever; I will take refuge in the covert of thy wings. Selah.
For thou, OGod, hast heard my vows; thou hast given [me] the inheritance of those that fear thy name.
Thou wilt add days to the days of the king: his years shall be as many generations.
He shall abide beforeGod for ever: bestow loving-kindness and truth, that they may preserve him.
So will I sing forth thy name for ever, performing my vows from day to day.

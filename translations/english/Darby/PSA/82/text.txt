God standeth in the assembly ofGod, he judgeth among thegods.
How long will ye judge unrighteously, and accept the person of the wicked? Selah.
Judge the poor and the fatherless, do justice to the afflicted and the destitute;
Rescue the poor and needy, deliver them out of the hand of the wicked.
They know not, neither do they understand; they walk on in darkness: all the foundations of the earth are moved.
I have said, Ye aregods, and all of you are children of the Most High;
But ye shall die like men, and fall like one of the princes.
Arise, OGod, judge the earth; for thou shalt inherit all the nations.

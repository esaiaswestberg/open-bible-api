Judge me, OGod, and plead my cause against an ungodly nation; deliver me from the deceitful and unrighteous man.
For thou art theGod of my strength: why hast thou cast me off? why go I about mourning because of the oppression of the enemy?
Send out thy light and thy truth: they shall lead me, they shall bring me to thy holy mount, and unto thy habitations.
Then will I go unto the altar ofGod, unto theGod of the gladness of my joy: yea, upon the harp will I praise thee, OGod, myGod.
Why art thou cast down, my soul? and why art thou disquieted within me? hope inGod; for I shall yet praise him, [who is] the health of my countenance, and myGod.

As the hart panteth after the water-brooks, so panteth my soul after thee, OGod.
My soul thirsteth forGod, for the livingGod: when shall I come and appear beforeGod?
My tears have been my bread day and night, while they say unto me all the day, Where is thyGod?
These things I remember and have poured out my soul within me: how I passed along with the multitude, how I went on with them to the house ofGod, with the voice of joy and praise, a festive multitude.
Why art thou cast down, my soul, and art disquieted in me? hope inGod; for I shall yet praise him, [for] the health of his countenance.
MyGod, my soul is cast down within me; therefore do I remember thee from the land of the Jordan, and the Hermons, from mount Mizar.
Deep calleth unto deep at the noise of thy cataracts; all thy breakers and thy billows are gone over me.
In the day-time will Jehovah command his loving-kindness, and in the night his song shall be with me, a prayer unto theGod of my life.
I will say untoGod my rock, Why hast thou forgotten me? why go I mourning because of the oppression of the enemy?
As with a crushing in my bones mine adversaries reproach me, while they say unto me all the day, Where is thyGod?
Why art thou cast down, my soul? and why art thou disquieted within me? hope inGod; for I shall yet praise him, [who is] the health of my countenance, and myGod.

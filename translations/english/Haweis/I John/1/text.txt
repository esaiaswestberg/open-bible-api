THAT which was from the beginning, which we have seen with our eyes, which we have gazed upon, and our hands have handled of the word of life;
(for the life was manifested, and we have beheld it, and bear testimony, and declare unto you that life eternal, which was with the Father, and was manifested to us;)
that which we have seen and heard, declare we to you, that ye also may have communion with us: and indeed our communion is with the Father, and with his Son Jesus Christ.
And these things write we unto you, that your joy may be complete.
And this is the promise which we have heard from him, and declare unto you, that God is light, and that darkness in him there is none.
If we say that we have communion with him, and walk in darkness, we lie, and practise not the truth:
but if we walk in the light, as he is himself in the light, we have communion with each other, and the blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanseth us from all sin.
If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us.
If we confess our sins, faithful is he and righteous to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.
If we say that we have not sinned, we make him a liar, and his word is not in us.

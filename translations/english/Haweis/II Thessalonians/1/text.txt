PAUL, and Silvanus, and Timothy, to the church of the Thessalonians in God our Father and in the Lord Jesus Christ:
grace unto you and peace, from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ.
We are bound to give thanks to God always for you, brethren, as it is fit, because your faith groweth exceedingly, and the love of every one of you all towards each other aboundeth:
so that we ourselves make our boast of you among the churches of God, for your patience and fidelity under all your persecutions and afflictions which ye endure:
which is a manifest proof of the righteous judgment of God, that ye should be counted worthy of the kingdom of God, for which ye also suffer:
seeing it is a righteous thing with God to recompense tribulation to them that trouble you;
and to you who are troubled, rest with us, at the revelation of the Lord Jesus Christ from heaven with his mighty angels,
in a flame of fire, taking vengeance of them that know not God, and obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ:
who shall receive punishment, even eternal perdition, from the presence of the Lord, and from the glory of his power:
when he shall come to be glorified in his saints, and to be admired by all those who believe; because our testimony was believed among you in that day.
Wherefore also we pray continually for you, that our God would count you worthy of the calling, and fulfil all the good pleasure of his goodness, and the work of faith with power:
that the name of our Lord Jesus Christ may be glorified by you, and you by him, according to the grace of our God and Lord, Jesus Christ.

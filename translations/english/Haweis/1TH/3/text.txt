WHEREFORE when we could no longer forbear, we thought it good to be left at Athens alone:
and sent Timothy our brother, and a minister of God, and our fellow-labourer in the gospel of Christ, that he might stablish you, and comfort you concerning your faith:
that no man might be shaken by these tribulations; for ye yourselves know that thereunto we are appointed.
For when we were with you, we told you before that we were about to suffer tribulation; as also it came to pass, and ye know.
For this cause also, when I could no longer forbear, I sent to know your fidelity, lest by any means the tempter had tempted you, and our labour should be in vain.
But now when Timothy returned to us from you, and brought us the glad tidings of your faith and love, and that ye retain a kind remembrance of us always, earnestly desirous to see us, as we are also to see you:
for this cause we have felt consolation, brethren, in you under all our tribulation and distress, because of your fidelity.
For now we live, if ye stand fast in the Lord.
For what sufficient thanks can we render to God for you, for all the joy with which we rejoice on your account before our God,
night and day most fervently praying that we may see your face, and amply supply the deficiencies of your faith?
Now God himself, and our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ direct our way unto you.
And the Lord cause you to abound and overflow with love one to another, and towards all men, as we also do to you:
to the end that your hearts may be established blameless in holiness before God and our Father, at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ with all his saints.

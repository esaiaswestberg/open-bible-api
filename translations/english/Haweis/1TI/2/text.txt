I EXHORT therefore, first of all, that there be offered supplications, prayers, intercessions, thanksgivings for the whole race of mankind:
for kings, and all that are in a state of eminence, that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and seriousness.
For this is becoming, and acceptable before God our Saviour;
who wills all men to be saved, and come to the acknowledgment of truth.
For there is one God, and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus;
who gave himself a ransom for all, the testimony to be born in his appointed times;
of which I am ordained a preacher and apostle, (I speak the truth in Christ, I lie not,) a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and truth.
I will then that men pray in every place, lifting up holy hands without wrath or doubting:
in like manner also that the women dress themselves in decent apparel, with modesty and sobriety; not with plaited tresses, or gold, or pearls, or very costly clothing,
but as becometh women professing godliness, with good works.
Let the woman learn in silence with all subjection:
for I permit not a woman to teach in public, or to assume authority over the man, but to abide in silence.
For Adam was first formed, Eve afterwards.
And Adam was not deceived, but the woman being deceived, by transgression fell.
But she shall be saved through childbearing, if they abide in faith, and love, and holiness with sobriety.

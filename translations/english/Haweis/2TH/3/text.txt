FINALLY, brethren, pray for us, that the word of the Lord may run, and be glorified, even as among you;
and that we may be delivered from unreasonable and wicked men: for there is not faith in all.
But the Lord is faithful, who will stablish you, and keep you from the wicked one.
But we have confidence in the Lord towards you, that the things which we have enjoined you, ye both do, and will do.
And the Lord direct your hearts into the love of God, and into the patience of Christ.
Now we command you, brethren, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, to withdraw yourselves from every brother who walketh disorderly, and not according to the injunction which he hath received from us.
For ye yourselves know how ye ought to imitate us; for we behaved not ourselves disorderly among you,
neither did we eat bread with any man unpaid for, but with labour and toil worked night and day, that we might be burdensome to none of you:
not that we have not such power, but that we might be ourselves an example for you to imitate.
For when we were with you, this we enjoined you, that if a man would not work, neither should he eat.
For we hear that there are some among you who walk disorderly, doing no work, but being busy-bodies.
Now such we command, and conjure, by our Lord Jesus Christ, that with quietness they labour, and eat their own bread.
But ye, brethren, be not weary of well doing.
And if any man obey not our word by letter, mark that man, and maintain no society with him, that he may be ashamed.
Yet regard him not as an enemy, but admonish him as a brother.
And the Lord of peace himself give you peace, by every means, in every situation.   The Lord be with you all.

The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.   The second epistle was written to the Thessalonians from Athens. \p

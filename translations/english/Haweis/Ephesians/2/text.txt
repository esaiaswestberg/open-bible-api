AND you hath he quickened, who were dead in trespasses and sins,
wherein in times past ye walked after the fashion of this world, after the prince of the power of the air, the spirit who now worketh with energy in the children of disobedience:
among whom also we all have had our conversation in time past, in the lusts of the flesh, fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind, and were by nature children of wrath, as well as the rest.
But God, being rich in mercy, through the great love with which he hath loved us,
though we were dead in sins, hath quickened us together with Christ, (by grace ye are saved,)
and hath raised us up together with him, and made us sit down together in the heavenly regions in Christ Jesus.
That he might shew forth in the ages to come the transcendent riches of his grace, in the kindness shewed to us in Christ Jesus.
For by grace ye are saved through faith, and this not of yourselves; it is the gift of God:
not by works, lest any man should boast;
for we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good works, for which God hath before prepared us, that we should walk therein.
Wherefore remember that ye in time past were Gentiles in the flesh, who are called uncircumcision by that called circumcision made by hands in the flesh;
that ye were at that time without Christ, alienated from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers to the covenants of promise, having no hope, and atheists in the world:
but now in Christ Jesus, ye who formerly were far off, are become nigh by the blood of Christ.
For he is our peace, who hath made both one, and hath broken down the middle wall of separation,
destroying the enmity in his flesh, even the law of precepts, in ordinances, that he might from the two create in himself one new man, making peace,
and might reconcile them both in one body to God by the cross, having slain the enmity thereby;
and coming, hath preached peace to you who were afar off, and to those who were nigh:
for through him we both have access by one Spirit unto the Father.
So then ye are no more strangers and foreigners, but fellow-citizens with the saints, and of the household of God;
built up on the foundation of apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief corner stone;
in whom the whole building exactly cemented together groweth into a holy temple in the Lord:
by whom also ye have been built up together for an habitation of God through the Spirit.

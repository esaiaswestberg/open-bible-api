AND I saw another sign in the heaven, great and wonderful, seven angels having the seven last plagues because by them is the wrath of God completely executed.
And I saw as it were a sea of glass mingled with fire; and those who had obtained the victory over the beast, and over his image, and over his mark, and over the number of his name standing upon the sea of glass, holding the harps of God.
And they sung the sacred ode of Moses the servant of the Lord, and the song of the Lamb, saying, Great and marvellous are thy works, O Lord God Almighty; righteous and true are thy ways, O King of saints.
Who should not fear thee, O Lord, and glorify thy name? because thou only art holy: for all nations shall come and worship before thee, because thy righteous judgments are made evident.
And after these things I beheld, and, lo! the temple of the tabernacle of witness in heaven was opened:
and the seven angels having the seven plagues came forth out of the temple, clothed in linen white and shining, and girded about the breasts with golden girdles.
And one of the four living beings gave unto the seven angels seven golden vases full of the wrath of God, who liveth for ever and ever.
And the temple was filled with smoke from the glory of God, and from his power; and no person was able to enter into the temple, until the seven plagues of the seven angels were completely executed.

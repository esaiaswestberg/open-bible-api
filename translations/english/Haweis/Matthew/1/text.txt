THE book of the genealogy of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham.
Abraham begat Isaac, and Isaac begat Jacob, and Jacob begat Judas and his brethren,
and Judas begat Phares, and Zara of Thamar, and Phares begat Esrom, and Esrom begat Aram;
and Aram begat Amminadab, and Amminadab begat Naasson, and Naasson begat Salmon,
and Salmon begat Boaz of Rachab, and Boaz begat Obed of Ruth, and Obed begat Jesse,
and Jesse begat David the king, and David the king begat Solomon of her that had been the wife of Urias,
and Solomon begat Roboam, and Roboam begat Abia, and Abia begat Asa,
and Asa begat Josaphat, and Josaphat begat Joram, and Joram begat Ozias,
and Ozias begat Joatham, and Joatham begat Ahaz, and Ahaz begat Hezekias,
and Hezekias begat Manasses, and Manasses begat Amon, and Amon begat Josias,
and Josias begat Jechonias and his brethren, about the time they were carried away to Babylon,
and after they were brought to Babylon, Jechonias begat Salathiel, and Salathiel begat Zorobabel,
and Zorobabel begat Abiud, and Abiud begat Eliakim, and Eliakim begat Azor,
and Azor begat Sadoc, and Sadoc begat Achim, and Achim begat Eliud,
and Eliud begat Eleazar, and Eleazar begat Matthan, and Matthan begat Jacob,
and Jacob begat Joseph, the husband of Mary, of whom is born Jesus, who is called Christ.
So all the generations from Abraham to David are fourteen generations, and from David to the carrying away into Babylon fourteen generations, and from the carrying away into Babylon unto Christ fourteen generations.
Now the generation of Jesus Christ was attended with these circumstances: His mother Mary being betrothed to Joseph, before they cohabited together, she was found with child from the Holy Spirit.
Then Joseph her husband being a just man, and not willing to expose her publicly, designed to put her away privately.
And as he was revolving the matter in his mind, behold, an angel of the Lord in a dream appeared unto him, saying, Joseph, son of David, fear not to take Mary for thy wife, for that which is conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit.
And she shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call his name Jesus, for he shall save his people from their sins.
Now the whole of this was done, that what was spoken of the Lord, by the prophet, might be fulfilled, saying,
“A virgin shall be with child and shall bring forth a son, and they shall call his name Immanuel,” which is being interpreted, God with us.
Then Joseph when arisen from sleep, did as the angel of the Lord commanded him, and took his wife;
and he knew her not, until she had brought forth her son, the first begotten, and he called his name Jesus.

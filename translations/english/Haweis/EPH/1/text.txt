PAUL, an apostle of Jesus Christ, by the will of God, to the saints which are at Ephesus, and to the faithful in Christ Jesus:
grace be unto you, and peace from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ.
Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who hath blessed us with every spiritual blessing in heavenly things in Christ;
as he hath elected us in him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and blameless before him in love:
having predestinated us for his adopted children by Jesus Christ unto himself, according to the good pleasure of his will,
to the praise of the glory of his grace, whereby he hath made us acceptable in that beloved one;
in whom we have redemption through his blood, even the forgiveness of sins, according to the riches of his grace;
wherein he hath abounded towards us with all wisdom and intelligence,
having made known to us the mystery of his will, according to his good pleasure, which he purposed in himself;
at the dispensation of the fulness of the appointed times to gather together under one head all things in Christ, whether they be things in heaven or things in earth, in him:
in whom also we have obtained our inheritance, predestinated according to the purpose of him who effectually worketh all things according to the counsel of his own will:
that we should be to the praise of his glory, who first had hope in Christ.
In whom ye also trusted after ye had heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation; in whom also, having believed, ye have been sealed with the holy Spirit of promise,
which is the earnest of our inheritance, until the final redemption, acquired by him, come, to the praise of his glory.
For this cause I also, since I heard of your faith in the Lord Jesus, and the love ye have to all saints,
have not ceased offering up my praises for you, making mention of you in my prayers,
that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, would give you the spirit of wisdom and revelation by the knowledge of him;
the eyes of your understanding being enlightened, that you may know what is the hope to which he hath called you, and what the riches of the glory of his inheritance for the saints,
and what the transcendent greatness of his power in us, who believe, according to the energy of his mighty strength
which he displayed in Christ when he raised him from the dead, and set him at his own right hand in the heavenly regions,
far above all principality, and authority, and power, and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this world, but also in that which is to come;
and hath put all things under his feet, and hath appointed him head over all to the church,
which is his body, the fulness of him that filleth all in all.

who have borne testimony to thy love before the church; to whom thou wilt perform a good act of service in forwarding them on their journey, in a manner worthy of God.

I had many things to write; but I would not write to thee with ink and pen:
but I hope shortly to see thee, and we shall speak mouth to mouth.   Peace be to thee. The friends salute thee. Salute the friends by name. \p

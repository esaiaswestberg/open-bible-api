LET every soul be subject to the superior powers: for there is no power but from God; the existing powers are appointed by God.
Wherefore he that sets himself against authority, resists the ordinance of God: and they who resist shall receive to themselves condemnation.
For rulers are not a terror to good works, but to evil. Wilt thou then not be afraid of the power? Do that which is good, and thou shalt have praise from it:
for he is the minister of God to thee for good. But if thou doest that which is evil, tremble! for he beareth not the sword in vain: for he is the minister of God, an avenger to inflict wrath on him that practises what is evil.
Wherefore there is a necessity for being in subjection, not only for fear of wrath, but also for conscience sake.
For on this account pay ye taxes also: for they are God’s ministers, continually employed on this very service.
Render therefore to all their dues: tribute to whom tribute is due, custom to whom custom, fear to whom fear, honour to whom honour.
Owe no man any thing, but to love one another: for he that loveth another hath fulfilled the law.
For this, Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt do no murder, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not bear false witness, Thou shalt not covet; and if there be any other commandment, it is comprised in this word, even in this, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.
Love doeth no ill to a neighbour; the fulfilment therefore of the law is love.
And thus do, knowing the time; for the hour is come that we should awake from sleep, for now our salvation is nearer than when we believed.
The night is far advanced, the day approaches: let us therefore put off the works of darkness, and let us put on the armour of light.
Let us walk becomingly as in the face of day, not in revels and drunkenness, not in impurities and wantonness, not in strife and envy.
But put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make not provision for the flesh, to gratify its passions.

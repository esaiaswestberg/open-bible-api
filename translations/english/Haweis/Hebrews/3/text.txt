WHEREFORE, holy brethren, partakers of the heavenly calling, contemplate the apostle and high-priest whom ye confess, Jesus Christ;
who was faithful to him who appointed him, as Moses also was in all his house.
For this personage hath been counted worthy of higher glory than Moses, inasmuch as he who built it, hath greater honour than the house.
For every house is built by some person; but he who is the architect of all things is God.
And Moses indeed was faithful in all that house of his as a servant, to bear testimony of the things which should be after spoken;
but Christ as a son over his own house: whose house are we, if we hold firmly the confidence and glorying of hope stedfast unto the end.
Wherefore, as the Holy Ghost saith, To day if ye will hear his voice,
harden not your hearts, as in that bitter provocation, at the day of the temptation in the wilderness;
when your fathers tempted me, proved me, and saw my works during forty years.
Wherefore I was provoked against that generation, and said, They are always deluded in heart, and they have not known my ways:
so I swore in my wrath that they shall not enter into my rest.
Take heed, brethren, that there be not in any one of you a wicked heart of infidelity, evident in departure from the living God:
but exhort one another daily, whilst to-day remains, that no one of you be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin.
For we are partakers with Christ, if we hold the beginning of our confidence firm unto the end;
while it is said, To-day if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts as in the provocation.
For some, though they had heard, provoked him; yet not all who came out of Egypt by Moses.
But against whom was he incensed forty years? Was it not against those who had sinned, whose corpses fell in the wilderness?
And to whom did he swear that they should not enter into his rest, but to those who did not believe?
So we see that they could not enter in because of unbelief.

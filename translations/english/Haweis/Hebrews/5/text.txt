FOR, every high-priest taken from among men, is constituted on behalf of men for those services which relate to God, that he should offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins:
being able to feel tenderly for the ignorant and erroneous; forasmuch as he is himself encompassed with infirmity.
And on this account he ought, as for the people, so also for himself, to offer sacrifice for sins.
And no man assumes to himself this honour, but he who is called of God, even as Aaron was.
So Christ also did not himself assume the glory to become high-priest, but he gave it who spake to him, “Thou art my Son; I have this day begotten thee.”
As he saith also in another passage, “Thou art priest forever after the order of Melchisedec;”
who in the days of his flesh, with strong crying and tears, having offered up prayers and supplications to him who was able to save him from death, and being heard for his reverential awe,
though he was a son, he learned obedience from the things which he suffered:
and complete himself, he became the author of eternal salvation to all who obey him;
publicly proclaimed of God high-priest after the order of Melchisedec.
Concerning whom we have much to discourse, and of difficult interpretation to explain, seeing ye are dull of hearing.
For though ye ought for the time to be teachers of others, ye have again need that some one teach you the leading principles of the oracles of God; and are become as those who need milk, and not solid food.
For every one who useth milk is inexperienced in the word of righteousness: for he is an infant.
But solid nourishment is proper for grown men, even as many as by habit have their organs of perception exercised for the discernment both of good and evil.

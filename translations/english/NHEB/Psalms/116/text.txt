I love the Lord, because he listens to my voice, and my cries for mercy.
Because he has turned his ear to me, therefore I will call on him as long as I live.
The cords of death surrounded me, the pains of Sheol got a hold of me. I found trouble and sorrow.
Then I called on the name of the Lord: "Lord, I beg you, deliver my soul."
The Lord is Gracious and righteous. Yes, our God is merciful.
The Lord preserves the simple. I was brought low, and he saved me.
Return to your rest, my soul, for the Lord has dealt bountifully with you.
For you have delivered my soul from death, my eyes from tears, and my feet from falling.
I will walk before the Lord in the land of the living.
I believed, therefore I said, "I am greatly afflicted."
I said in my haste, "All men are liars."
What will I give to the Lord for all his benefits toward me?
I will take the cup of salvation, and call on the name of the Lord.
I will pay my vows to the Lord, yes, in the presence of all his people.
Precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of his holy ones.
Lord, truly I am your servant. I am your servant, the son of your handmaid. You have freed me from my chains.
I will offer to you the sacrifice of thanksgiving, and will call on the name of the Lord.
I will pay my vows to the Lord, yes, in the presence of all his people,
in the courts of the Lord's house, in the midst of you, Jerusalem. Praise Yah!

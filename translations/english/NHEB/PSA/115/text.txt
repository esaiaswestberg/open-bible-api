Not to us, Lord, not to us, but to your name give glory, for your loving kindness, and for your truth's sake.
Why should the nations say, "Where is their God, now?"
But our God is in the heavens. He does whatever he pleases.
Their idols are silver and gold, the work of men's hands.
They have mouths, but they do not speak. They have eyes, but they do not see.
They have ears, but they do not hear. They have noses, but they do not smell.
They have hands, but they do not feel. They have feet, but they do not walk, neither do they speak through their throat.
Those who make them will be like them; yes, everyone who trusts in them.
Israel, trust in the Lord! He is their help and their shield.
House of Aaron, trust in the Lord! He is their help and their shield.
You who fear the Lord, trust in the Lord! He is their help and their shield.
The Lord remembers us. He will bless us. He will bless the house of Israel. He will bless the house of Aaron.
He will bless those who fear the Lord, both small and great.
May the Lord increase you more and more, you and your children.
Blessed are you by the Lord, who made heaven and earth.
The heavens are the heavens of the Lord; but the earth has he given to the children of men.
The dead do not praise Yah, neither any who go down into silence;
But we will bless Yah, from this time forth and forevermore. Praise the Lord!

Jehovah hath reigned, peoples tremble, The Inhabitant of the cherubs, the earth shaketh.
Jehovah in Zion <FI>is<Fi> great, And high He <FI>is<Fi> over all the peoples.
They praise Thy name, `Great, and fearful, holy <FI>it<Fi> is.'
And the strength of the king Hath loved judgment, Thou--Thou hast established uprightness; Judgment and righteousness in Jacob, Thou--Thou hast done.
Exalt ye Jehovah our God, And bow yourselves at His footstool, holy <FI>is<Fi> He.
Moses and Aaron among His priests, And Samuel among those proclaiming His name. They are calling unto Jehovah, And He doth answer them.
In a pillar of cloud He speaketh unto them, They have kept His testimonies, And the statute He hath given to them.
O Jehovah, our God, Thou hast afflicted them, A God forgiving Thou hast been to them, And taking vengeance on their actions.
Exalt ye Jehovah our God, And bow yourselves at His holy hill, For holy <FI>is<Fi> Jehovah our God!

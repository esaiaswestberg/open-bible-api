To the Overseer. --By a servant of Jehovah, by David. The transgression of the wicked Is affirming within my heart, `Fear of God is not before his eyes,
For he made <FI>it<Fi> smooth to himself in his eyes, To find his iniquity to be hated.
The words of his mouth <FI>are<Fi> iniquity and deceit, He ceased to act prudently--to do good.
Iniquity he deviseth on his bed, He stationeth himself on a way not good, Evil he doth not refuse.'
O Jehovah, in the heavens <FI>is<Fi> Thy kindness, Thy faithfulness <FI>is<Fi> unto the clouds.
Thy righteousness <FI>is<Fi> as mountains of God, Thy judgments <FI>are<Fi> a great deep. Man and beast Thou savest, O Jehovah.
How precious <FI>is<Fi> Thy kindness, O God, And the sons of men In the shadow of Thy wings do trust.
They are filled from the fatness of Thy house, And the stream of Thy delights Thou dost cause them to drink.
For with Thee <FI>is<Fi> a fountain of life, In Thy light we see light.
Draw out Thy kindness to those knowing Thee, And Thy righteousness to the upright of heart.
Let not a foot of pride meet me, And a hand of the wicked let not move me.
There have workers of iniquity fallen, They have been overthrown, And have not been able to arise!

A Song of the Ascents. O the happiness of every one fearing Jehovah, Who is walking in His ways.
The labour of thy hands thou surely eatest, Happy <FI>art<Fi> thou, and good <FI>is<Fi> to thee.
Thy wife <FI>is<Fi> as a fruitful vine in the sides of thy house, Thy sons as olive plants around thy table.
Lo, surely thus is the man blessed who is fearing Jehovah.
Jehovah doth bless thee out of Zion, Look, then, on the good of Jerusalem, All the days of thy life,
And see the sons of thy sons! Peace on Israel!

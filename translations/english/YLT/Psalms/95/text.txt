Come in, we bow ourselves, and we bend, We kneel before Jehovah our Maker.
For He <FI>is<Fi> our God, and we the people of His pasture, And the flock of His hand, To-day, if to His voice ye hearken,
Harden not your heart as <FI>in<Fi> Meribah, As <FI>in<Fi> the day of Massah in the wilderness,
Where your fathers have tried Me, Have proved Me, yea, have seen My work.
Forty years I am weary of the generation, And I say, `A people erring in heart--they! And they have not known My ways:'
Where I sware in Mine anger, `If they come in unto My rest--!'

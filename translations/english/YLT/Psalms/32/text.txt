By David. --An Instruction. O the happiness of him whose transgression <FI>is<Fi> forgiven, Whose sin is covered.
O the happiness of a man, To whom Jehovah imputeth not iniquity, And in whose spirit there is no deceit.
When I have kept silence, become old have my bones, Through my roaring all the day.
When by day and by night Thy hand is heavy upon me, My moisture hath been changed Into the droughts of summer. Selah.
My sin I cause Thee to know, And mine iniquity I have not covered. I have said, `I confess concerning My transgressions to Jehovah,' And Thou--Thou hast taken away, The iniquity of my sin. Selah.
For this doth every saintly one pray to Thee, As the time to find. Surely at an overflowing of many waters, Unto him they come not.
Thou <FI>art<Fi> a hiding-place for me, From distress Thou dost keep me, <FI>With<Fi> songs of deliverance dost compass me. Selah.
I cause thee to act wisely, And direct thee in the way that thou goest, I cause mine eye to take counsel concerning thee.
Be ye not as a horse--as a mule, Without understanding, With bridle and bit, its ornaments, to curb, Not to come near unto thee.
Many <FI>are<Fi> the pains of the wicked; As to him who is trusting in Jehovah, Kindness doth compass him.
Be glad in Jehovah, and rejoice, ye righteous, And sing, all ye upright of heart!

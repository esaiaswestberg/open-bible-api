A Song of the Ascents. Those trusting in Jehovah <FI>are<Fi> as Mount Zion, It is not moved--to the age it abideth.
Jerusalem! mountains <FI>are<Fi> round about her, And Jehovah <FI>is<Fi> round about His people, From henceforth even unto the age.
For the rod of wickedness resteth not On the lot of the righteous, That the righteous put not forth on iniquity their hands.
Do good, O Jehovah, to the good, And to the upright in their hearts.
As to those turning <FI>to<Fi> their crooked ways, Jehovah causeth them to go with workers of iniquity. Peace on Israel!

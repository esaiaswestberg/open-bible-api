To the Overseer. --`Destroy not.' --A secret treasure of David, in his fleeing from the face of Saul into a cave. Favour me, O God, favour me, For in Thee is my soul trusting, And in the shadow of Thy wings I trust, Until the calamities pass over.
I call to God Most High, To God <FI>who<Fi> is perfecting for me.
He sendeth from the heaven, and saveth me, He reproached--who is panting after me. Selah. God sendeth forth His kindness and His truth.
My soul <FI>is<Fi> in the midst of lions, I lie down <FI>among<Fi> flames--sons of men, Their teeth <FI>are<Fi> a spear and arrows, And their tongue a sharp sword.
Be Thou exalted above the heavens, O God, Above all the earth Thine honour.
A net they have prepared for my steps, Bowed down hath my soul, They have digged before me a pit, They have fallen into its midst. Selah.
Prepared is my heart, O God, Prepared is my heart, I sing and praise.
Awake, mine honour, awake, psaltery and harp, I awake the morning dawn.
I thank Thee among the peoples, O Lord, I praise Thee among the nations.
For great unto the heavens <FI>is<Fi> Thy kindness, And unto the clouds Thy truth.
Be thou exalted above the heavens, O God. Above all the earth Thine honour!

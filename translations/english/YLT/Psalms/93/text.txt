Jehovah hath reigned, Excellency He hath put on, Jehovah put on strength, He girded Himself, Also--established is the world, unmoved.
Established is Thy throne since then, From the age Thou <FI>art<Fi> .
Floods have lifted up, O Jehovah, Floods have lifted up their voice, Floods lift up their breakers.
Than the voices of many mighty waters, Breakers of a sea, mighty on high <FI>is<Fi> Jehovah,
Thy testimonies have been very stedfast, To Thy house comely <FI>is<Fi> holiness, O Jehovah, for length of days!

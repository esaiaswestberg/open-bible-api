And God speaketh unto Moses, and saith unto him, `I <FI>am<Fi> Jehovah,
and I appear unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob, as God Almighty; as to My name Jehovah, I have not been known to them;
and also I have established My covenant with them, to give to them the land of Canaan, the land of their sojournings, wherein they have sojourned;
and also I have heard the groaning of the sons of Israel, whom the Egyptians are causing to serve, and I remember My covenant.
`Therefore say to the sons of Israel, I <FI>am<Fi> Jehovah, and I have brought you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians, and have delivered you from their service, and have redeemed you by a stretched-out arm, and by great judgments,
and have taken you to Me for a people, and I have been to you for God, and ye have known that I <FI>am<Fi> Jehovah your God, who is bringing you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians;
and I have brought you in unto the land which I have lifted up My hand to give it to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, and have given it to you--a possession; I <FI>am<Fi> Jehovah.'
And Moses speaketh so unto the sons of Israel, and they hearkened not unto Moses, for anguish of spirit, and for harsh service.
And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses, saying,
`Go in, speak unto Pharaoh king of Egypt, and he doth send the sons of Israel out of his land;
and Moses speaketh before Jehovah, saying, `Lo, the sons of Israel have not hearkened unto me, and how doth Pharaoh hear me, and I of uncircumcised lips?'
And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses, and unto Aaron, and chargeth them for the sons of Israel, and for Pharaoh king of Egypt, to bring out the sons of Israel from the land of Egypt.

To the Overseer, to Jeduthun. --A Psalm of David. I have said, `I observe my ways, Against sinning with my tongue, I keep for my mouth a curb, while the wicked <FI>is<Fi> before me.'
I was dumb <FI>with<Fi> silence, I kept silent from good, and my pain is excited.
Hot <FI>is<Fi> my heart within me, In my meditating doth the fire burn, I have spoken with my tongue.
`Cause me to know, O Jehovah, mine end, And the measure of my days--what it <FI>is<Fi> ,' I know how frail I <FI>am<Fi> .
Lo, handbreadths Thou hast made my days, And mine age <FI>is<Fi> as nothing before Thee, Only, all vanity <FI>is<Fi> every man set up. Selah.
Only, in an image doth each walk habitually, Only, <FI>in<Fi> vain, they are disquieted, He heapeth up and knoweth not who gathereth them.
And, now, what have I expected? O Lord, my hope--it <FI>is<Fi> of Thee.
From all my transgressions deliver me, A reproach of the fool make me not.
I have been dumb, I open not my mouth, Because Thou--Thou hast done <FI>it<Fi> .
Turn aside from off me Thy stroke, From the striving of Thy hand I have been consumed.
With reproofs against iniquity, Thou hast corrected man, And dost waste as a moth his desirableness, Only, vanity <FI>is<Fi> every man. Selah.
Hear my prayer, O Jehovah, And <FI>to<Fi> my cry give ear, Unto my tear be not silent, For a sojourner I <FI>am<Fi> with Thee, A settler like all my fathers.
Look from me, and I brighten up before I go and am not!

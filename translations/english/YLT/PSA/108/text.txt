A Song, a Psalm of David. Prepared is my heart, O God, I sing, yea, I sing praise, also my honour.
Awake, psaltery and harp, I awake the dawn.
I thank Thee among peoples, O Jehovah, And I praise Thee among the nations.
For great above the heavens <FI>is<Fi> Thy kindness, And unto the clouds Thy truth.
Be Thou exalted above the heavens, O God, And above all the earth Thy honour.
That Thy beloved ones may be delivered, Save <FI>with<Fi> Thy right hand, and answer us.
God hath spoken in His holiness: I exult, I apportion Shechem, And the valley of Succoth I measure,
Mine <FI>is<Fi> Gilead, mine <FI>is<Fi> Manasseh, And Ephraim <FI>is<Fi> the strength of my head, Judah <FI>is<Fi> my lawgiver,
Moab <FI>is<Fi> a pot for my washing, Upon Edom I cast my shoe, Over Philistia I shout habitually.
Who doth bring me in to the fenced city? Who hath led me unto Edom?
Hast not Thou, O God, cast us off? And Thou goest not out, O God, with our hosts!
Give to us help from adversity, And vain is the salvation of man.
In God we do mightily, And He doth tread down our adversaries!

Praise ye Jah! Praise, ye servants of Jehovah. Praise the name of Jehovah.
The name of Jehovah is blessed, From henceforth, and unto the age.
From the rising of the sun unto its going in, Praised <FI>is<Fi> the name of Jehovah.
High above all nations <FI>is<Fi> Jehovah, Above the heavens <FI>is<Fi> his honour.
Who <FI>is<Fi> as Jehovah our God, He is exalting <FI>Himself<Fi> to sit?
He is humbling <FI>Himself<Fi> to look On the heavens and on the earth.
He is raising up from the dust the poor, From a dunghill He exalteth the needy.
To cause to sit with princes, With the princes of His people.
Causing the barren one of the house to sit, A joyful mother of sons; praise ye Jah!

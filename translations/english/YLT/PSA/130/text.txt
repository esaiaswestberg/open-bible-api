A Song of the Ascents. From depths I have called Thee, Jehovah.
Lord, hearken to my voice, Thine ears are attentive to the voice of my supplications.
If iniquities Thou dost observe, O Lord, who doth stand?
But with Thee <FI>is<Fi> forgiveness, that Thou mayest be feared.
I hoped <FI>for<Fi> Jehovah--hoped hath my soul, And for His word I have waited.
My soul <FI>is<Fi> for the Lord, More than those watching for morning, Watching for morning!
Israel doth wait on Jehovah, For with Jehovah <FI>is<Fi> kindness, And abundant with Him <FI>is<Fi> redemption.
And He doth redeem Israel from all his iniquities!

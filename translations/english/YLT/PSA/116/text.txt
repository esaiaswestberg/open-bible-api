I have loved, because Jehovah heareth My voice, my supplication,
Because He hath inclined His ear to me, And during my days I call.
Compassed me have cords of death, And straits of Sheol have found me, Distress and sorrow I find.
And in the name of Jehovah I call: I pray Thee, O Jehovah, deliver my soul,
Gracious <FI>is<Fi> Jehovah, and righteous, Yea, our God <FI>is<Fi> merciful,
A preserver of the simple <FI>is<Fi> Jehovah, I was low, and to me He giveth salvation.
Turn back, O my soul, to thy rest, For Jehovah hath conferred benefits on thee.
For Thou hast delivered my soul from death, My eyes from tears, my feet from overthrowing.
I walk habitually before Jehovah In the lands of the living.
I have believed, for I speak, I--I have been afflicted greatly.
I said in my haste, `Every man <FI>is<Fi> a liar.'
What do I return to Jehovah? All His benefits <FI>are<Fi> upon me.
The cup of salvation I lift up, And in the name of Jehovah I call.
My vows to Jehovah let me complete, I pray you, before all His people.
Precious in the eyes of Jehovah <FI>is<Fi> the death for His saints.
Cause <FI>it<Fi> to come, O Jehovah, for I <FI>am<Fi> Thy servant. I <FI>am<Fi> Thy servant, son of Thy handmaid, Thou hast opened my bonds.
To Thee I sacrifice a sacrifice of thanks, And in the name of Jehovah I call.
My vows to Jehovah let me complete, I pray you, before all His people,
In the courts of the house of Jehovah, In thy midst, O Jerusalem, praise ye Jah!

A Song of the Ascents, by David. Save <FI>for<Fi> Jehovah--who hath been for us, (Pray, let Israel say),
Save <FI>for<Fi> Jehovah--who hath been for us, In the rising up of man against us,
Then alive they had swallowed us up, In the burning of their anger against us,
Then the waters had overflowed us, The stream passed over our soul,
Then passed over our soul had the proud waters.
Blessed <FI>is<Fi> Jehovah who hath not given us, A prey to their teeth.
Our soul as a bird hath escaped from a snare of fowlers, The snare was broken, and we have escaped.
Our help <FI>is<Fi> in the name of Jehovah, Maker of the heavens and earth!

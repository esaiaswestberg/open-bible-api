And Job answereth and saith: --
Also--to-day <FI>is<Fi> my complaint bitter, My hand hath been heavy because of my sighing.
O that I had known--and I find Him, I come in unto His seat,
I arrange before Him the cause, And my mouth fill <FI>with<Fi> arguments.
I know the words He doth answer me, And understand what He saith to me.
In the abundance of power doth He strive with me? No! surely He putteth <FI>it<Fi> in me.
There the upright doth reason with Him, And I escape for ever from my judge.
Lo, forward I go--and He is not, And backward--and I perceive him not.
<FI> To<Fi> the left in His working--and I see not, He is covered <FI>on<Fi> the right, and I behold not.
For He hath known the way with me, He hath tried me--as gold I go forth.
On His step hath my foot laid hold, His way I have kept, and turn not aside,
The command of His lips, and I depart not. Above my allotted portion I have laid up The sayings of His mouth.
And He <FI>is<Fi> in one <FI>mind<Fi> , And who doth turn Him back? And His soul hath desired--and He doth <FI>it<Fi> .
For He doth complete my portion, And many such things <FI>are<Fi> with Him.
Therefore, from His presence I am troubled, I consider, and am afraid of Him.
And God hath made my heart soft, And the Mighty hath troubled me.
For I have not been cut off before darkness, And before me He covered thick darkness.

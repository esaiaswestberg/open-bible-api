In their tribulation, they will arise early to me. Come, let us return to the Lord.
For he has seized us, and he will heal us. He will strike, and he will cure us.
He will revive us after two days; on the third day he will raise us up, and we will live in his sight. We will understand, and we will continue on, so that we may know the Lord. His landing place has been prepared like the first light of morning, and he will come to us like the early and the late rains of the land.

But you, Judah, set a harvest for yourself, while I reverse the captivity of my people.

But Zophar the Naamathite, responding, said:
Will he who speaks much, not also listen? Or will a talkative man be justified?
Will men be silent only for you? And when you have mocked others, will no one refute you?
For you said: “My word is pure, and I am clean in your sight.”
Yet I wish that God would speak with you, and would open his lips to you,
so that he might reveal to you the secrets of wisdom, and how intricate his law is, and that you would understand how much less he requires of you than your iniquity deserves.
By chance, will you comprehend the footsteps of God and reach all the way to the perfection of the Almighty?
He is higher than heaven, and what will you do? He is deeper than hell, but how will you know?
His measure is longer than the earth and wider than the sea.
If he overturns all things, or packs them together, who will contradict him?
For he knows the vanity of men, and when he sees iniquity, does he not evaluate it?
A vain man is lifted up in arrogance, and he thinks that he is born free like a wild ass’s colt.
But you have fortified your heart and extended your hands to him.
If you would send away from you the iniquity that is in your hand, and not let injustice remain in your tabernacle,
then you would be able to lift up your face without blemish, and you would be steadfast and unafraid.
Misery, likewise, you would forget, or would remember only like waters that have passed by.
And brightness, like that of midday, will rise upon you until evening, and when you would think yourself consumed, you will rise up like the morning star.
And, when hope has been set before you, you will have faith, and, when buried, you will sleep secure.
You will rest, and there will be nothing to make you afraid, and many will make requests before your face.
But the eyes of the impious will fade away, and the path to escape will perish before them, for the abomination of the soul is their hope.

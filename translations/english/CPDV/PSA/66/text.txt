Unto the end. With hymns, a Canticle Psalm of David.
May God have mercy on us and bless us. May he shine his countenance upon us, and may he have mercy on us.
So may we know your way upon the earth, your salvation among all nations.
Let the peoples confess to you, O God. Let all the peoples confess to you.
May the nations rejoice and exult. For you judge the peoples with equity, and you direct the nations on earth.
Let the peoples confess to you, O God. Let all the peoples confess to you.
The earth has provided her fruit. May God, our God, bless us.
May God bless us, and may all the ends of the earth fear him.

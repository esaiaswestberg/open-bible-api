Unto the end. With hymns, of David.
O God, pay attention to my supplication. Be attentive to my prayer.
I cried out to you from the ends of the earth. When my heart was in anguish, you exalted me on a rock. You have led me,
for you have been my hope, a tower of strength before the face of the enemy.
I will dwell in your tabernacle forever. I will be protected under the cover of your wings.
For you, my God, have listened to my prayer. You have granted an inheritance to those who fear your name.
You will add days to the days of the king, to his years, even to the time of generation after generation.
He remains in eternity, in the sight of God. Who will long for his mercy and truth?
So I will compose a psalm to your name, forever and ever, so that I may repay my vows from day to day.

Unto the end. A Psalm of David.
May the Lord hear you in the day of tribulation. May the name of the God of Jacob protect you.
May he send you help from the sanctuary and watch over you from Zion.
May he be mindful of all your sacrifices, and may your burnt-offerings be fat.
May he grant to you according to your heart, and confirm all your counsels.
We will rejoice in your salvation, and in the name of our God, we will be magnified.
May the Lord fulfill all your petitions. Now I know that the Lord has saved his Christ.  He will hear him from his holy heaven. The salvation of his right hand is in his power.
Some trust in chariots, and some in horses, but we will call upon the name of the Lord our God.
They have been bound, and they have fallen. But we have risen up, and we have been set upright.
O Lord, save the king, and hear us on the day that we will call upon you.

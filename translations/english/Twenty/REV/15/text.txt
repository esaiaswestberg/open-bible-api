Then I saw another portent in the heavens — a great and marvellous portent — seven angels with the seven last Curses; because with them the Wrath of God is ended.
Then I saw what appeared to be a sea of glass mixed with fire; and, standing by this sea of glass, holding the harps of God, I saw those who had come victorious out of the conflict with the Beast and its image and the number that formed its name.
They are singing the song of Moses, the Servant of God, and the song of the Lamb —   ‘Great and marvellous are thy deeds, O Lord, our God, the Almighty. Righteous and true are thy ways, Eternal King.
Who will not reverence and praise thy Name, O Lord? Thou alone art holy! All nations will come and worship before thee, for thy judgments have become manifest.’
After this I saw that the inmost shrine of the Tabernacle of Revelation in Heaven was opened,
and out of it came the seven angels with the seven Curses. They were adorned with precious stones, pure and bright, and had golden girdles round their breasts.
One of the four Creatures gave the seven angels seven golden bowls, filled with the Wrath of God who lives for ever and ever.
‘The Temple was filled with smoke from the Glory’ and Majesty of God; and no one could enter the Temple, until the seven Curses inflicted by the seven angels were at an end.

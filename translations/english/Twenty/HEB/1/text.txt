God, who, of old, at many times and in many ways, spoke to our ancestors, by the Prophets,
has in these latter days spoken to us by the Son, whom he appointed the heir of all things, and through whom he made the universe.
For he is the radiance of the Glory of God and the very expression of his Being, upholding all creation by the power of his word; and, when he had made an expiation for the sins of men, he ‘took his seat at the right hand’ of God’s Majesty on high,
having shown himself as much greater than the angels as the Name that he has inherited surpasses theirs.
For to which of the angels did God ever say —   ‘Thou art my Son; this day I have become thy Father’? or again — ‘I will be to him a Father, and he shall be to me a Son’?
And again, when God brought the First-born into the world, he said — ‘Let all the angels of God bow down before him.’
Speaking of the angels, he said — ‘He makes the winds his angels And the fiery flames his servants’;
while of the Son he said — ‘God is thy throne for ever and ever; The sceptre of his Kingdom is the sceptre of Justice;
Thou lovest righteousness and hatest iniquity; Therefore God, thy God, has anointed thee with the festal oil more abundantly than thy peers.’
Again — ‘Thou, Lord, in the beginning didst lay the foundation of the earth, And the heavens are the work of thy hands.
They shall perish, but thou remainest; As a garment they shall all grow old;
As a mantle thou wilt fold them up, And as a garment they shall be changed, But thou art the same, and thy years shall know no end.’
To which of the angels has God ever said — ‘Sit thou at my right hand Until I put thy enemies as a stool for thy feet’?
Are not all the angels spirits in the service of God, sent out to minister for the sake of those who are destined to obtain Salvation?

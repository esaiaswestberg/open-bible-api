“Sore have they vexed me from youth” thus let Israel say
“Sore have they vexed me from youth, but they have not prevailed against me.
The ploughers ploughed on my back, they made their furrows long.
But the Lord, who is righteous, has cut the cords of the wicked.”
Let all who are haters of Zion be put to shame and defeated.
May they be as the grass on the house-top, which withers before it shoots up;
which fills not the arms of the reaper, nor the lap of the binder of sheaves,
whereof no one says as they pass, “The blessing of God be upon you.”    In the name of the Lord we bless you.

The Lord is my shepherd: I am never in need.
He lays me down in green pastures. He gently leads me to waters of rest,
he refreshes my life. He guides me along paths that are straight, true to his name.
And when my way lies through a valley of gloom, I fear no evil, for you are with me. Your rod and your staff comfort me.
You spread a table for me in face of my foes; with oil you anoint my head, and my cup runs over.
Surely goodness and love will pursue me --- all the days of my life. In the house of the Lord I will live through the length of the days.

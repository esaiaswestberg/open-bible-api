I was glad when they said to me, “We will go to the house of the Lord.”
Now we are standing, within your gates, O Jerusalem.
O Jerusalem, built close-packed, like a city without breach or gap,
to you do the tribes come, the tribes of the Lord, as the law has ordained for Israel, there to give thanks to the Lord.
There once stood thrones of justice even thrones of the household of David.
Pray that all may be well with Jerusalem, and well with those who love you,
well within your ramparts, and well within your palaces.
For the sake of my brethren and friends, I will wish you now prosperity:
for the sake of the house of the Lord our God, I will seek your good.

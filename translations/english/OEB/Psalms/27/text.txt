The Lord is my light and my saviour; whom then should I fear? The Lord protects my life; whom then should I dread?
When the wicked drew near to assail me and eat up my flesh, it was those who distressed and opposed me who stumbled and fell.
Though against me a host should encamp, yet my heart would be fearless: though battle should rise up against me, still would I be trustful.
One thing have I asked of the Lord, and that do I long for --- To live in the house of the Lord all the days of my life, to gaze on the grace of the Lord and inquire in his temple.
For he will hide me in his shelter in the day of misfortune. In his sheltering tent he hides me: he lifts me up on a rock.
And now that my head he has lifted above my encircling foes, I will march round the altar and sacrifice, shouting with joy, in his tent, making music and song to the Lord.
Hear, O Lord, my loud cry, and graciously answer me.
My heart has said to you, “Your face, O Lord, I seek.”
Hide not your face from me, reject not your servant in anger: for you have been my help. Abandon me not, nor forsake me, O God of my help:
for father and mother have left me; but the Lord will take me up.
Teach me your way, O Lord: lead me in an even path, because of my enemies.
Give me not up, O Lord, unto the rage of my foes; for against me have risen false witnesses, breathing out cruelty.
Firm is the faith I cherish, that I, in the land of the living, will yet see the goodness of God.
Let your heart be courageous and strong, and wait on the Lord.

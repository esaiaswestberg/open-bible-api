Save me, O God, from my enemies; secure me from my assailants.
Save me from those who do wrong, save me from the bloodthisty.
For see! They lay ambush for me, strong men are banded against me not for sin or transgression of mine, for no guilt of mine, O Lord,
they run and make ready. Awake! Come forth to meet me, and see!
You, O Lord of hosts, God of Israel, awake! And punish the proud, every one; spare none of the traitors vile. (Selah)
At evening they come, and, howling like dogs, make their round in the city.
Look at their venomous mouths, tongues like swords, they think no one hears them.
But you, Lord, laugh at them, you mock all the insolent.
My strength, I will sing to you, for God is my sure retreat.
My God with his love will meet me, and feast my eyes on my foes.
Slay them not, lest my people forget, let your hosts keep them roaming and wandering.
In their sinful speech snare them, O Lord; and may they be trapped in their pride, for the curses and lies that they utter.
In your wrath make a clean end of them, that people, to the ends of the earth, may know that God rules in Jacob. (Selah)
At evening they come, and, howling like dogs, make their round in the city.
They roam about for a feast, and snarl, if they get not their fill.
But I will sing of your might; I will ring out your love in the morning. For to me you have been a sure refuge, a retreat in the day of my trouble.
My strength, I will sing praise to you, for God is my sure retreat, my faithful God.

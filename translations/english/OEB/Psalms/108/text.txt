My heart is steadfast, O God, my heart is steadfast. I would sing, I would make music; awake, my soul. Awake, harp and lyre; I would wake the dawn. I would praise you among the peoples, O Lord; make music among the nations to you. For great to heaven is your love, and your faithfulness to the clouds. Be exalted, O God, o’er the heavens, and your glory o’er all the earth.




So those you love may be rescued, save by your right hand and answer us.
God did solemnly swear: “As victor will I divide Shechem, portion out the valley of Succoth.
Mine is Gilead, mine is Manasseh, Ephraim is my helmet, Judah my sceptre of rule,
Moab the pot that I wash in, on Edom I hurl my sandal, I shout o’er Philistia in triumph.”
O to be brought to the fortified city! O to be led into Edom!
Have you not spurned us, O God? You do not march forth with our armies.
Grant us help from the foe, for human help is worthless.
With God we shall yet do bravely, he himself will tread down our foes.

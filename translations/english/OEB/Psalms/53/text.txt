Fools say in their heart, “There is no God.” Vile, hateful their life is; not one does good.
From heaven God looks out on humans, to see if any are wise, and care for God.
But all have turned bad, the taint is on all; not one does good, no, not one.
Have they learned their lesson, those workers of evil? Who ate up my people, eating, devouring, never calling to the Lord.
Sore afraid will they be, where no fear was; when God scatters the bones of the godless people. They will be put to shame, when God rejects them.
If only help from Zion would come for Israel! When God brings his people a change of fortune, how glad will be Jacob, and Israel how joyful!

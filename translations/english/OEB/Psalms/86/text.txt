Incline your ear, Lord, and answer me, for I am afflicted and needy. Guard me, for I am loyal: save your servant, who trusts in you.

Lord, be gracious to me, for you are my God; I cry to you all the day.
Gladden the heart of your servant; for to you, Lord, I set my hope.
For you, Lord, are good and forgiving, rich in love towards all who call on you.
Listen, O Lord, to my prayer; attend to my plea for mercy.
In the day of my trouble I call on you, with assurance that you will answer me.
None of the gods is like you, Lord, nor are any works like yours.
All the nations you have made will come and bow down before you, giving glory, O Lord, to your name.
For great are you, and a doer of wonders; you alone are God.
Teach me, O Lord, your way, that I may walk in your truth: so my heart shall rejoice in your name.
I will give you thanks, O Lord, with all my heart, my God, I will honour your name forever.
For great is your love towards me, from the depths of Sheol you have saved me.
Haughty men have risen up against me, O God, a band of the violent seeking my life, who think nothing of you.
But you are a God of pity and grace, patient and rich in kindness and faithfulness; turn to me with your grace, O Lord.
Grant your strength to your servant, and save the child of your handmaid.
Show me a sign of your favour, which those who hate me may see with confusion, since you, Lord, are my helper and comforter.

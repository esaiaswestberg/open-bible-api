How many, Lord, are my foes! Those who rise up against me are many.
Many are those who say of me, “There is no help for him in his God.” (Selah)
But you, Lord, are shield about me, my glory, who lifts up my head.
When loudly I call to the Lord, from his holy hill he gives answer. (Selah)
I laid down and slept: now I wake, for the Lord sustains me.
I fear not the myriads of people who beset me on every side.
Arise, Lord: save me, my God, who strikes all my foes on the cheek, and shatters the teeth of the wicked.
Victory belongs to the Lord: let your blessing descend on your people. (Selah)

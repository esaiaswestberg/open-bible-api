Listen, O Lord, to my prayer; give ear to my plea. In your faithfulness give me answer, and in your righteousness. With your servant O enter you not into judgment, for in your sight can no one alive be justified.

For the enemy persecutes me, crushing my life to the ground, making me live in the darkness, as those who have long been dead.
My spirit is faint within me, my heart is bewildered within me.
I remember the days of old, and brood over all you have done, musing on all that your hands have wrought.
I spread out my hands to you: I thirst for you, like parched earth. (Selah)
Answer me soon, Lord, because my spirit is spent. Hide not your face from me, else become I like those who go down to the pit.
Let me learn of your love in the morning, for my trust is in you. Teach me the way I should go: for my heart longs for you.
Save me, O Lord, from my foes: for to you I have fled for refuge.
Teach me to do your will, for you yourself are my God. Guide me by your good spirit, O Lord, on a way that is smooth.
Be true to your name Lord, spare me, bring me out of distress in your faithfulness.
In your kindness extinguish my enemies, and all those who vex me destroy; for I am your servant.

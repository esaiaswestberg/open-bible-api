To you, O Lord, I lift up my heart: all the day I wait for you.
In you I trust, put me not to shame; let not my foes exult over me.
None will be shamed who wait for you, but shame will fall upon wanton traitors.
Make me, O Lord, to know your ways: teach me your paths.
In your faithfulness guide me and teach me, for you are my God and my Saviour.
Remember your pity, O Lord, and your kindness, for they have been ever of old.
Do not remember the sins of my youth; remember me in kindness, because of your goodness, Lord.
Good is the Lord and upright, so he teaches sinners the way.
The humble he guides in the right, he teaches the humble his way.
All his ways are loving and loyal to those who observe his charges and covenant.
Be true to your name Lord, forgive my many sins.
Who then is the person who fears the Lord? He will teach them the way to choose.
They will live in prosperity, their children will inherit the land.
The Lord gives guidance to those who fear him, and with his covenant he makes them acquainted.
My eyes are ever toward the Lord, for out of the net he brings my foot.
Turn to me with your favour, for I am lonely and crushed
In my heart are strain and storm; bring me out of my distresses.
Look on my misery and trouble, and pardon all my sins,
look on my foes oh, so many! And their cruel hatred towards me.
Deliver me, keep me, and shame not one who takes refuge in you.
May integrity and innocence preserve me, for I wait for you, O Lord.
Redeem Israel, O God, from all its distresses.

I will bless the Lord at all times, in my mouth will his praise be forever.
In the Lord will my heart make her boast, the humble will hear and be glad.
O magnify the Lord with me and let us extol his name together.
I sought the Lord, and, in answer, he saved me from all my terrors.
Look to him and you will be radiant, with faces unashamed.
Here is one who was crushed, but cried --- and was heard by the Lord, and brought safe out of every trouble.
The Lord’s angel encamps about those who fear him, and rescues them.
O taste and see that the Lord is good, happy are those who take refuge in him!
Fear the Lord, all his people, for they who fear him lack nothing.
Even young lions may be poor and hungry, but those who seek the Lord will not lack any good thing.
Come, children, listen to me. I will teach you the fear of the Lord.
Which of you is desirous of life, loves many and happy days?
Then guard your tongue from evil, and your lips from speaking deceit.
Depart from evil, and do good; seek peace, and pursue it.
The eyes of the Lord are towards the righteous, his ears are towards their cry for help.
The Lord sets his face against those who do evil, to root their memory out of the earth.
When they cry, they are heard by the Lord, and he saves them from all their distresses.
The Lord is near to the broken-hearted, he helps those whose spirit is crushed.
Many misfortunes befall the righteous, but the Lord delivers them out of them all.
He guards all their bones, not one of them is broken.
Misfortune will slay the ungodly; those who hate the righteous are doomed.
The Lord ransoms the life of his servants, and none will be doomed who takes refuge in him.

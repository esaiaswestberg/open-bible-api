O God, you have spurned and broken us, routing us in your wrath --- restore us!
You have shaken the land and cleft it; heal its tottering breaches.
You have made your people drink hardship, and given us wine of reeling.
You have given those who fear you a banner, a rallying-place from the bow, (Selah)
for the rescue of your beloved. Save by your right hand and answer us.
God did solemnly swear: “As victor will I divide Shechem, and mete out the valley of Succoth.
Mine is Gilead, mine is Manasseh, Ephraim is the defence of my head, Judah my sceptre of rule,
Moab the pot that I wash in, Edom — I cast my shoe over it, I shout o’er Philistia in triumph.”
O to be brought to the fortified city! O to be led into Edom!
Have you not spurned us, O God? You do not march forth with our armies.
Grant us help from the foe, for human help is worthless.
With God we shall yet do bravely: he himself will tread down our foes.

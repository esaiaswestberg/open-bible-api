Sing a new song to the Lord, for he has done wonders; his right hand and holy arm have won him the victory.
The Lord has made his victory known, and revealed to the eyes of the nations his righteousness.
Mindful he was of his kindness to Jacob, faithful he was to the house of Israel. All the ends of the earth have seen the victory of our God.
Shout, all the earth, to the Lord: break into cries and music.
Play on the lyre to the Lord, on the lyre and with loud melody.
With trumpet and sound of horn, shout before the king.
Let the sea and its fulness roar, the world and the dwellers upon it.
Let the streams clap their hands, let the hills shout for gladness together
before the Lord for he comes, he comes to judge the earth. He will judge the world with justice and the nations with equity.

Unto you, O Lord, do I cry; my rock, be not deaf to me: lest, through holding your peace, I become like those who go down to the pit.
Hear my loud entreaty, as I cry for help to you, lifting my hands, O Lord, towards your holy chancel.
Take me not off with the wicked, nor with the workers of wrong, whose speech to their neighbours is friendly, while evil is in their heart.
Give them as they have done, as their wicked deeds deserve. As their hands have wrought, so give to them: requite to them their deserts.
They are blind to all that the Lord does, to all that his hands have wrought; and so he will tear them down, to build them up no more.
Blest be the Lord, who has heard my voice as I plead for mercy.
The Lord is my strength and my shield; my heart trusts in him. I was helped: so my heart is exultant, and in my song I will praise him.
The Lord is the strength of his people, the fortress who saves his anointed.
O save your people, and bless your inheritance. Be their shepherd and carry them forever.

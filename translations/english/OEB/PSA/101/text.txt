If kindness and justice I sing, making melody to you, Lord.
I would look to the way that is blameless, and make it my own.    Within my own house I would walk with an innocent heart.
I would never direct my eyes to a thing that is base.    The impulse to stray I abhor it shall not cling to me.
Far from me be perverseness of heart, or kinship with evil.
Whoso slanders their neighbour in secret, I bring them to silence: haughty looks and proud hearts I will not abide.
I will favour the true in the land, they shall live in my court. Those who walk in a way that is blameless shall be my attendant.
No one shall live in my house who practises guile. No one that speaks a lie shall abide in my presence.
Morn by morn I will wholly wipe out all the bad in the land, and cut off from the Lord’s own city all workers of evil.

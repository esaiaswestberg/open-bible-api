God, who, of old, at many times and in many ways, spoke to our ancestors, by the prophets,
has in these latter days spoken to us by the Son, whom he appointed the heir of all things, and through whom he made the universe.
For he is the radiance of the glory of God and the expression of his being, upholding all creation by the power of his word; and, when he had made an expiation for the sins of humanity, he ‘took his seat at the right hand’ of God’s Majesty on high,
having shown himself as much greater than the angels as the name that he has inherited surpasses theirs.
For to which of the angels did God ever say —  ‘You are my Son; this day I have become your Father’?  or again —  ‘I will be to him a Father, and he will be to me a Son’?
And again, when God brought the first-born into the world, he said —  ‘Let all the angels of God bow down before him.’
Speaking of the angels, he said —  ‘He makes the winds his angels And the flames of fire his servants’;
while of the Son he said —  ‘God is your throne for ever and ever; The scepter of his kingdom is the scepter of Justice;
You love righteousness and hates iniquity; Therefore God, your God, has anointed you with the festal oil more abundantly than your peers.’
Again —  ‘You, Lord, in the beginning did lay the foundation of the earth, And the heavens are the work of your hands.
They will perish, but you remain; As a garment they will all grow old;
As a mantle you will fold them up, And as a garment they will be changed, But you are the same, and your years will know no end.’
To which of the angels has God ever said —  ‘Sit you at my right hand Until I put your enemies as a stool for your feet’?
Are not all the angels spirits in the service of God, sent out to minister for the sake of those who are destined to obtain salvation?

God, who at different times and in different ways spoke of old to the fathers by the prophets,
hath at the end of these days spoken to us by his Son, whom he appointed heir of all things, by whom he also made the worlds,
who being a brightness from his glory and an image of his being, and upholding all things by the word of his power, when he had by himself accomplished a cleansing of sins, sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high;
having become so much superior to the angels, as he hath inherited a more excellent name than they.
For to which of the angels did he ever say: "Thou art my Son, I this day have begotten thee?" and again: "I will be to him a Father, and he shall be to me a Son?"
And again, when he hath brought in the first-begotten into the world, he saith: "And let all the angels of God pay him homage."
And of the angels he saith: "Who maketh his angels winds, and his ministers a flame of fire;"
but of the Son: "Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever; and the sceptre of thy kingdom is a sceptre of righteousness.
Thou lovedst righteousness, and hatedst iniquity; therefore God, thy God, anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows."
And: "Thou, Lord, in the beginning didst found the earth, and the heavens are the works of thy hands.
They will perish, but thou remainest; and they will all become old as doth a garment,
and thou wilt fold them up as a vesture, and they will be changed; but thou art the same, and thy years will not fail."
But to which of the angels hath he ever said: "Sit on my right hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool?"
Are they not all ministering spirits, sent forth to minister for the sake of those who are to inherit salvation?

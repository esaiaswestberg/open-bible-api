Moreover Jehovah spake to Job, and said:
Will the censurer of the Almighty contend with him? Will the reprover of God answer?
Then Job answered Jehovah, and said:
Behold, I am vile! what can I answer thee? I will lay my hand upon my mouth.
Once have I spoken, but I will not speak again; Yea, twice, but I will say no more.
Then spake Jehovah to Job out of the whirlwind, and said:
Gird up now thy loins like a man! I will ask thee, and do thou instruct me!
Wilt thou even disannul my right? Wilt thou condemn me, that thou mayst be righteous?
Hast thou an arm like God’s? Or canst thou thunder with thy voice like him?
Deck thyself with grandeur and majesty, And array thyself in splendor and glory!
Send forth the fury of thy wrath! Look upon every proud one, and abase him!
Look upon every proud one, and bring him low; Yea, tread down the wicked in their place!
Hide them in the dust together; Shut up their faces in darkness!
Then, indeed, will I give thee the praise, That thine own right hand can save thee.
Behold the river-horse, which I have made as well as thyself; He feedeth on grass like the ox.
Behold, what strength is in his loins! And what force in the muscles of his belly!
He bendeth his tail, like the cedar, And the sinews of his thighs are twisted together.
His bones are pipes of brass, And his limbs are bars of iron.
He is chief among the works of God; He that made him gave him his sword.
For the mountains supply him with food, Where all the beasts of the field play.
He lieth down under the lote-plants, In the covert of reeds, and in the fens.
The lote-plants cover him with their shadow, And the willows of the brook compass him about.
Lo! the stream overfloweth, but he starteth not; He is unmoved though Jordan rush forth even to his mouth.
Can one take him before his eyes, Or pierce his nose with hooks?

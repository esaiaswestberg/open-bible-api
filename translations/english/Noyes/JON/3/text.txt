And the word of Jehovah came to Jonah the second time, saying,
Arise, go to Nineveh, that great city, and proclaim to her the words which I shall speak to thee.
And Jonah arose and went to Nineveh, according to the word of Jehovah. Now Nineveh was through God a great city, three days’ journey in extent.
And Jonah began to enter into the city a day’s journey, and he cried out and said, Yet forty days, and Nineveh shall be overthrown.
And the men of Nineveh believed God, and proclaimed a fast, and put on sackcloth, from the greatest of them even to the least of them.
For when the matter came to the king of Nineveh, he arose from his throne, and put off his mantle and covered himself with sackcloth, and sat in ashes.
And he caused it to be proclaimed and published through Nineveh by the decree of the king and his nobles, saying, Let neither man nor beast, herd nor flock, taste anything; let them not feed, nor drink water.
But let man and beast be covered with sackcloth, and cry mightily to God. Yea, let them turn every one from his evil way, and from the violence that is in their hands.
Who can tell if God will turn and repent, and turn away from his fierce anger, that we perish not?
And God saw their works, that they turned from their evil way: and God repented of the evil which he had said that he would do to them, and he did it not.

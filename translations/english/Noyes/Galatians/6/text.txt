Brethren, even if a man be detected in a fault, do ye who are spiritual restore such a one in the spirit of meekness; considering thyself, lest thou also be tempted.
Bear ye one another’s burdens, and thus fulfill the law of Christ.
For if a man thinketh himself to be something, when he is nothing, he deceiveth himself.
But let each one prove his own work, and then will he have his ground for boasting in himself alone, and not in comparison with another;
for every one must bear his own load.
Let him that is taught in the word share with the teacher in all good things.
Be not deceived; God is not mocked; for whatever a man soweth, that shall he also reap;
for he that soweth to his flesh, shall of the flesh reap corruption; but he that soweth to the Spirit, shall of the Spirit reap life everlasting.
And let us not be faint-hearted in well-doing; for in due season we shall reap, if we faint not.
So then, as we have opportunity, let us do good to all, especially to those who are of the household of faith.
See in what large letters I have written to you with my own hand.
As many as desire to make a fair show in the flesh, these are constraining you to be circumcised, only that they may not suffer persecution for the cross of Christ.
For not even do they who become circumcised themselves keep the Law; but they desire to have you circumcised, that they may glory in your flesh.
But God forbid that I should glory, save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ; through whom the world is crucified to me, and I to the world.
For neither is circumcision anything, nor uncircumcision, but a new creation.
And as many as walk by this rule, peace be upon them, and mercy, and upon the Israel of God.
Henceforth let no one trouble me; for I bear the marks of Jesus on my body.
The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit, brethren. Amen.

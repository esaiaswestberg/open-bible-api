Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said:
Dominion and fear are with Him; He maintaineth peace in his high places.
Is there any numbering of his hosts? And upon whom doth not his light arise?
How then can man be righteous before? Or how can he be pure that is born of woman?
Behold, even the moon, it shineth not; And the stars are not pure in his sight,
How much less, man, a worm; And the son of man, a reptile!

But do thou speak the things which become sound teaching;
that aged men be sober, grave, discreet, sound in faith, in love, in patience;
that aged women likewise be in behavior as becometh holiness, not false accusers, not enslaved to much wine, teachers of what is good,
that they may teach the young women to love their husbands, to love their children,
to be discreet, chaste, workers at home, good, in subjection to their own husbands, that the word of God be not blasphemed.
The younger men likewise exhort to be sober-minded;
in all things showing thyself a pattern of good works, in teaching showing uncorruptness, gravity,
sound speech that cannot be condemned; that he that is opposed to us may be put to shame, having no evil thing to say of us.
Exhort bond-servants to be in subjection to their own masters, in all things to be well-pleasing to them,
not contradicting, not purloining, but showing all good faith; that they may adorn the teaching of God our Saviour in all things.
For the grace of God, that bringeth salvation to all men, was manifested,
teaching us that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live soberly, righteously, and godly, in the present world;
looking for the blessed hope, and appearing of the glory of the great God and of our Saviour Jesus Christ;
who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify to himself a people to be his own, zealous in good works.
These things speak and exhort, and rebuke with all authority. Let no one despise thee.

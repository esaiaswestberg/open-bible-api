Paul, and Silvanus, and Timothy, to the church of the Thessalonians in God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ:
Grace be to you, and peace, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
We ought to thank God always for you, brethren, as is fit, because your faith increaseth exceedingly, and the love of every one of you all toward each ether aboundeth;
so that we ourselves glory in you among the churches of God, for your constancy and faith in all your persecutions and the afflictions which ye endure;
an indication of the righteous judgment of God, by which ye will be counted worthy of the kingdom of God, for which ye are also suffering;
since it will be just with God to repay distress to them that distress you,
and to you the distressed rest with us, when the Lord Jesus shall be manifested from heaven, with the angels of his might,
in flaming fire, taking vengeance on them that know not God, and that obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus;
who will be punished with everlasting destruction proceeding from the presence of the Lord and from the glory of his power,
when he shall come in that day to be glorified in his saints, and to be admired in all who believed; for our testimony to you was believed.
For which end we also pray always for you, that our God may count you worthy of your calling, and perfect [in you] all pleasure in goodness, and the work of faith, with power;
that the name of our Lord Jesus Christ may be glorified in you, and ye in him, according to the grace of our God and of the Lord Jesus Christ.

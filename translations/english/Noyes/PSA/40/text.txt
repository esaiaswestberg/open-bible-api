I trusted steadfastly in the LORD, And he listened, and heard my cry.
He drew me out of a horrible pit, Out of the miry clay; He set my feet upon a rock, And made my steps firm.
He hath put into my mouth a new song, A song of praise to our God. Many shall see, and fear, And put their trust in the LORD.
Happy the man who maketh the LORD his trust, And resorteth not to men of pride and falsehood!
Many, O LORD, my God! are the wonderful works which thou hast done; Many have been thy gracious purposes towards us; None can be compared to thee! Would I declare and rehearse them, they are more than can be numbered.
In sacrifice and oblation thou hast no pleasure; Mine ears thou hast opened; Burnt-offering and sin-offering thou requirest not.
Therefore I said, "Lo, I come; In the scroll of the book it is prescribed to me;
O my God! to do thy will is my delight, And thy law dwelleth in my heart!"
I have proclaimed thy righteousness in the great assembly; Lo, I have not restrained my lips, O LORD! thou knowest!
I hide not thy justice in my heart; I declare thy faithfulness and thy salvation; I conceal not thy mercy and truth from the great assembly.
Withdraw not from me thy tender mercies, O LORD! May thy loving-kindness and thy truth continually preserve me!
For evils without number have encompassed me; My iniquities have overtaken me; I cannot see the end of them; They are more than the hairs of my head, And my heart dieth within me.
May it please thee, O LORD! to deliver me! O LORD! make haste to mine aid!
May they all be confounded and covered with shame Who seek to take away my life! Let them be driven back with disgrace Who desire to do me injury!
Let them be overwhelmed with confusion Who cry out to me, Aha! aha!
But let all who seek thee Be glad and rejoice in thee! Let those who love thy protection Ever say, "Great is Jehovah!"
I am poor and afflicted, yet the Lord thinketh upon me; Thou art my help and my deliverer; My God! make no delay!

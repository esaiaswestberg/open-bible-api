Shout joyfully unto God. all ye lands!
Sing ye the honor of his name; Make his praise glorious!
Say unto God, How terrible are thy doings! Through the greatness of thy power thine enemies are suppliants to thee!
Let all the earth worship thee; Let it sing praise to thee, let it sing praise to thy name! [Pause.]
Come, behold the works of God! How terrible his doings among the sons of men!
He turned the sea into dry land; They went through the deep on foot; Then we rejoiced in him.
By his power he ruleth for ever; His eyes are fixed upon the nations; Let not the rebellious exalt themselves! [Pause.]
O bless our God, ye nations. And make the voice of his praise to be heard!
It is he who preserveth our lives, And suffereth not our feet to stumble.
Thou hast, indeed, proved us, O God! Thou hast tried us as silver is tried.
Thou broughtest us into a snare, And didst lay a heavy burden upon our backs;
Thou didst cause men to ride upon our heads, And we have gone through fire and water: But thou hast brought us to a place of abundance.
I will go into thy house with burnt-offerings! I will pay thee my vows,—
The vows which my lips uttered. Which my mouth promised in my trouble.
Burnt sacrifices of fatlings will I offer to thee with the fat of rams; Bullocks, with he-goats, will I sacrifice to thee. [Pause.]
Come and hear, all ye who fear God, And I will relate what he hath done for me!
I called upon him with my mouth, And praise is now upon my tongue.
If I had meditated wickedness in my heart, The Lord would not have heard me:
But surely God hath heard me; He hath had regard to the voice of my supplication.
Blessed be God, who did not reject my prayer, Nor withhold his mercy from me!

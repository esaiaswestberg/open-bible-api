Happy is he who feareth the LORD, Who walketh in his ways!
Thou shalt eat the labor of thy hands; Happy shalt thou be, and it shall be well with thee!
Thy wife shall be like a fruitful vine within thy house; Thy children like olive-branches round about thy table.
Behold! thus happy is the man who feareth the LORD!
Jehovah shall bless thee out of Zion, And thou shalt see the prosperity of Jerusalem all the days of thy life;
Yea, thou shalt see thy children’s children. Peace be to Israel!

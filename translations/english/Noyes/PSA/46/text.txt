God is our refuge and strength; An ever present help in trouble.
Therefore will we not fear, though the earth be changed; Though the mountains tremble in the heart of the sea;
Though its waters roar and be troubled, And the mountains shake with the swelling thereof. [Pause.]
A river with its streams shall make glad the city of God, The holy dwelling-place of the Most High.
God is the midst of her; she shall not be moved; God will help her, and that full early.
The nations raged; kingdoms were moved; He uttered his voice, the earth melted.
The LORD of hosts is with us; The God of Jacob is our refuge. [Pause.]
Come, behold the doings of the LORD; What desolations he hath made in the earth!
He causeth wars to cease to the end of the earth; He hath broken the bow, and snapped the spear asunder, And burned the chariots in fire.
"Desist, and know that I am God; I will be exalted among the nations, I will be exalted throughout the earth!"
The LORD of hosts is with us; The God of Jacob is our refuge.

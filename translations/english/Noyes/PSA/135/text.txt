Praise ye the LORD! Praise ye the name of the LORD! Praise him, O ye servants of the LORD!
Ye who stand in the house of the LORD, In the courts of the house of our God!
Praise ye the LORD, for the LORD is good; Praise his name, for he is kind!
For the LORD chose Jacob for himself, And Israel for his own possession.
I know that the LORD is great; That our Lord is above all gods.
All that the LORD pleaseth, that he doeth, In heaven and upon earth, In the sea, and in all deeps.
He causeth the clouds to ascend from the ends of the earth; He maketh lightnings for the rain; He bringeth the wind from his store-houses.
He smote the first-born of Egypt, Both of man and beast.
He sent signs and wonders into the midst of thee, O Egypt! Against Pharaoh and all his servants!
He smote many nations, And slew mighty kings;
Sihon, the king of the Amorites, And Og, the king of Bashan, And all the kings of Canaan;
And gave their land for an inheritance, For an inheritance to Israel, his people.
Thy name, O LORD! endureth for ever; Thy memorial, O LORD! to all generations!
For the LORD judgeth his people, And hath compassion on his servants.
The idols of the nations are silver and gold, The work of men’s hands.
They have mouths, but they speak not; Eyes have they, but they see not.
They have ears, but they hear not; And there is no breath in their mouths.
They that make them are like them; So is every one that trusteth in them.
Praise the LORD, O house of Israel! Praise the LORD, O house of Aaron!
Praise the LORD, O house of Levi! Ye that fear the LORD, bless the LORD!
Praised be the LORD out of Zion, He that dwelleth in Jerusalem! Praise ye the LORD!

Much have they afflicted me from my youth, May Israel now say;
Much have they afflicted me from my youth, Yet have they not prevailed against me.
The ploughers ploughed up my back; They made long their furrows;
But the LORD was righteous; He cut asunder the cords of the wicked.
Let all be driven back with shame Who hate Zion!
Let them be as grass upon the house-tops, Which withereth before one pulleth it up;
With which the reaper filleth not his hand, Nor he that bindeth sheaves his bosom!
And they who pass by do not say, "The blessing of the LORD be upon you! We bless you in the name of the LORD!"

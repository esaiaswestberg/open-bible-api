Jehovah said to my lord, "Sit thou at my right hand, Until I make thy foes thy footstool."
Jehovah will extend the sceptre of thy power from Zion: Rule thou in the midst of thine enemies!
Thy people shall be ready, when thou musterest thy forces, in holy splendor; Thy youth shall come forth like dew from the womb of the morning.
Jehovah hath sworn, and he will not repent: "Thou art a priest for ever, After the order of Melchisedeck!"
The Lord is at thy right hand, He shall crush kings in the day of his wrath.
He shall execute justice among the nations; He shall fill them with dead bodies, He shall crush the heads of his enemies over many lands.
He shall drink of the brook in the way; Therefore shall he lift up his head.

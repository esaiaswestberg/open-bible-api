Help, LORD; for the godly man ceaseth; The faithful are failing among men.
They speak falsehood one to another; With flattering lips, with a double heart, do they speak.
May the LORD destroy all flattering lips, And the tongue which speaketh proud things!
Who say, "With our tongues will we prevail; Our lips are our reliance; Who is lord over us?"
For the oppression of the poor and the sighing of the wretched, Now will I stand up, saith the LORD; I will set in safety him whom they puff at.
The words of the LORD are pure; Like silver purified in a furnace on the earth, Seven times refined.
Thou, O LORD! will watch over them; Thou wilt preserve them from this generation for ever.
The wicked walk on every side, When the vilest of men are exalted.

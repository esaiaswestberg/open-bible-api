I will praise thee, O LORD! with my whole heart; I will show forth all thy marvellous works.
I will be glad and rejoice in thee: I will sing praise to thy name, O thou Most High!
All my enemies are turned back; They fall and perish at thy presence.
For thou dost defend my right and my cause; Thou sittest upon the throne, a righteous judge.
Thou rebukest the nations; Thou destroyest the wicked; Thou blottest out their name for evermore!
The enemy is fallen,—a desolation for ever! Thou, O LORD! hast destroyed their cities; Their memory itself hath perished!
The LORD reigneth for ever; He hath prepared his throne for judgment.
He judgeth the world in righteousness; He administereth judgment to the nations with uprightness.
Yea, the LORD is a refuge for the oppressed; A refuge in times of trouble.
They who know thy name put their trust in thee; For thou, O LORD! forsakest not them that seek thee!
Sing praises to the LORD, who reigneth in Zion; Declare his doings among the people!
As the avenger of blood, he remembereth the distressed; He forgetteth not their complaint.
"Have pity upon me, [said I,] O LORD! Look upon my affliction through them that hate me; Lift me up from the gates of death:
That I may show forth all thy praise in the gates of the daughter of Zion; That I may rejoice in salvation by thee."
The nations have sunk into the pit which they made; In the net, which they hid, is their own foot taken.
Thus it is known that the LORD executeth judgment; The wicked are ensnared in the work of their own hands. [Stringed instruments. Pause.]
The wicked shall be driven into the underworld; Yea, all the nations that forger God.
For the poor shall not always be forgotten; The hopes of the afflicted shall not perish for ever.
Arise, O LORD! Let not man prevail; Let the nations be judged by thee!
Strike terror into them, O LORD! Let the nations know that they are but men! [Pause.]

The LORD reigneth, let the earth rejoice! Let the multitude of isles be glad!
Clouds and darkness are round about him; Justice and equity are the foundation of his throne.
Before him goeth a fire, Which burneth up his enemies around.
His lightnings illumine the world; The earth beholdeth and trembleth.
The mountains melt like wax at the presence of the LORD, At the presence of the Lord of the whole earth.
The heavens declare his righteousness, And all nations behold his glory.
Confounded be they who worship graven images, Who glory in idols! To him, all ye gods, bow down!
Zion hath heard, and is glad, And the daughters of Judah exult On account of thy judgments, O LORD!
For thou, O LORD! art most high above all the earth; Thou art far exalted above all gods!
Ye that love the LORD, hate evil! He preserveth the lives of his servants, And delivereth them from the hand of the wicked.
Light is sown for the righteous, And joy for the upright in heart.
Rejoice, O ye righteous, in the LORD, And praise his holy name!

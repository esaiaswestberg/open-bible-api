Deliver me, O LORD! from the evil man, Save me from the man of violence,
Who meditate mischief in their heart, And daily stir up war!
They sharpen their tongues like a serpent; The poison of the adder is under their lips. [Pause.]
Defend me, O LORD! from the hands of the wicked, Preserve me from the man of violence, Who have purposed to cause my fall! [Pause.]
The proud have hidden snares and cords for me; They have spread a net by the way-side; They have set traps for me.
I say to Jehovah, Thou art my God; Hear, O Jehovah! the voice of my supplication!
The Lord Jehovah is my saving strength: Thou shelterest my head in the day of battle!
Grant not, O LORD! the desires of the wicked; Let not their devices prosper; Let them not exalt themselves!
As for the heads of those who encompass me, Let the mischief of their own lips cover them!
Let burning coals fall upon them; May they be cast into the fire, And into deep waters from which they shall not arise!
The slanderer shall not be established upon the earth; Evil shall pursue the violent man to destruction.
I know that the LORD will maintain the cause of the afflicted, And the right of the poor.
Yea, the righteous shall praise thy name; The upright shall dwell in thy presence!

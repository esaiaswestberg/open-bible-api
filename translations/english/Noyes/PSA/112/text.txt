Praise ye the LORD! Happy the man who feareth the LORD, Who taketh delight in his commandments!
His posterity shall be mighty on the earth; The race of the righteous shall be blessed.
Wealth and riches shall be in his house; His righteousness shall endure for ever.
To the righteous shall arise light out of darkness; He is gracious and full of compassion and righteousness.
Happy the man who hath pity and lendeth! He shall sustain his cause in judgment;
Yea, he shall never be moved: The righteous shall be in everlasting remembrance.
He is not afraid of evil tidings; His heart is firm, trusting in the LORD.
His heart is firm; he hath no fear, Till he see his desire upon his enemies.
He hath scattered blessings; he hath given to the poor; His righteousness shall endure for ever; His horn shall be exalted with honor.
The wicked shall see, and be grieved; He shall gnash his teeth, and melt away; The desire of the wicked shall perish.

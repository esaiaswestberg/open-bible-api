And the word of Jehovah came to me, saying:
Son of man, what is the wood of the vine more than any wood,—a branch, that is among the trees of the forest?
Shall wood be taken from it to be wrought into any work? Or will men take a pin of it to hang a vessel upon?
Behold, it is cast into the fire for fuel; the fire devoureth both the ends of it, and the middle of it is burned. Is it then fit for any work?
Behold, when it was whole, nothing could be made of it; how much less can anything be made of it when the fire hath devoured it and it is burned!
Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: As the wood of the vine among the trees of the forest, which I have given to the fire for fuel, so will I give to it the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
And I will set my face against them; they shall go out from one fire, and another fire shall devour them; and ye shall know that I am Jehovah, when I set my face against them.
And I will make the land desolate, because they have grievously trespassed, saith the Lord Jehovah.

As fellow-workers, then, with him, we also exhort you that ye receive not the grace of God in vain;
(for he saith: "In an accepted time I heard thee, and in the day of salvation I helped thee;" Behold, now is the accepted time, behold, now is the day of salvation;)
giving no occasion for stumbling in anything, that the ministry may not be blamed;
but as God’s ministers recommending ourselves in all things, in much endurance, in afflictions, in necessities, in distresses,
in stripes, in imprisonments, in tumults, in labors, in watchings, in fastings;
in pureness, in knowledge, in long-suffering, in kindness, in the Holy Spirit, in love unfeigned,
in the word of truth, in the power of God, by the weapons of righteousness on the right hand and on the left,
through honor and dishonor, through evil report and good report; as deceivers, and true;
as unknown, and well known; as dying, and behold, we live; as chastened, and not killed;
as sorrowful, yet always rejoicing; as poor, yet making many rich; as having nothing, and possessing all things.
Our mouth is open to you, O Corinthians, our heart is enlarged.
Ye have not a narrow place in my heart, but ye have a narrow place for me in yours.
So then in return, I speak to you as children, let your hearts be enlarged.
Be not strangely yoked with unbelievers; for what fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness? Or what communion hath light with darkness?
And what concord hath Christ with Beliar? Or what part hath a believer with an unbeliever?
And what agreement hath the temple of God with idols? For ye are the temple of the living God; as God said: "I will dwell among them, and walk among them; and I will be their God, and they shall be my people."
"Wherefore come out from the midst of them, and be separated, saith the Lord, and touch not anything unclean;" "and I will receive you,
and will be to you a father, and ye shall be my sons and daughters, saith the Lord Almighty."

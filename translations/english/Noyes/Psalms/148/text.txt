Praise ye the LORD! Praise the LORD from the heavens! Praise him in the heights!
Praise him, all ye his angels! Praise him, all ye his hosts!
Praise ye him, sun and moon! Praise him, all ye stars of light!
Praise him, ye heavens of heavens! Ye waters, that are above the heavens!
Let them praise the name of the LORD; For he commanded, and they were created.
He hath also established them for ever; He hath given them a law, and they transgress it not.
Praise the LORD from the earth, Ye sea-monsters, and all deeps!
Fire and hail, snow and vapor; Thou tempest, that fulfillest his word!
Ye mountains, and all hills! Fruit-trees, and all cedars!
Ye wild beasts, and all cattle! Ye creeping things, and winged birds!
Ye kings, and all peoples, Princes, and all judges of the earth!
Young men and maidens, Old men and children!
Let them praise the name of the LORD! For his name alone is exalted; His glory is above the earth and the heavens.
He exalteth the horn of his people, The glory of all his godly ones, Of the children of Israel, a people near to him. Praise ye the LORD!

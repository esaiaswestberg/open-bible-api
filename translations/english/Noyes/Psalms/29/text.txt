Give to Jehovah, O ye sons of God! Give to Jehovah glory and praise!
Give to Jehovah the glory due to his name; Worship Jehovah in holy attire!
The voice of Jehovah is heard above the waters; The God of glory thundereth,-Jehovah above the great waters.
The voice of Jehovah is powerful; The voice of Jehovah is full of majesty;
The voice of Jehovah breaketh the cedars; Yea, Jehovah breaketh the cedars of Lebanon;
Yea, he maketh them to leap like a calf,—Lebanon and Sirion like a young buffalo.
The voice of Jehovah divideth the flames of fire.
The voice of Jehovah maketh the wilderness tremble; Yea, Jehovah maketh the wilderness of Kadesh tremble.
The voice of Jehovah maketh the hinds bring forth, And layeth bare the forests; While, in his palace, every one declareth his glory.
Jehovah sitteth above the flood; Yea, Jehovah sitteth king for ever.
Jehovah will give strength to his people; Jehovah will bless his people with peace.

I lift up mine eyes to the hills: Whence cometh my help?
My help cometh from the LORD, Who made heaven and earth.
He will not suffer thy foot to stumble; Thy guardian doth not slumber.
Behold, the guardian of Israel Doth neither slumber nor sleep.
The LORD is thy guardian; The LORD is thy shade at thy right hand.
The sun shall not smite thee by day, Nor the moon by night.
The LORD will preserve thee from all evil; He will preserve thy life.
The LORD will preserve thee, when thou goest out and when thou comest in, From this time forth for ever.

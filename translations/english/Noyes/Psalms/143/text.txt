Hear my prayer, O LORD! give ear to my supplications! In thy faithfulness, and in thy righteousness, answer me!
Enter not into judgment with thy servant; For before thee no man living is righteous.
For the enemy pursueth my life; He hath smitten me to the ground; He hath made me dwell in darkness, As those that have been dead of old.
My spirit is overwhelmed within me; My heart within me is desolate.
I remember the days of old; I meditate on all thy works; I muse on the deeds of thy hands.
I stretch forth my hands unto thee; My soul thirsteth for thee, like a parched land.
Hear me speedily, O LORD! My spirit faileth; Hide not thy face from me. Lest I become like those who go down to the pit!
Cause me so see thy loving-kindness speedily; For in thee do I trust! Make known to me the way which I should take; For to thee do I lift up my soul!
Deliver me, O LORD! from mine enemies; For in thee do I seek refuge!
Teach me to do thy will; For thou art my God! Let thy good spirit lead me in a plain path!
Revive me, O LORD! for thy name’s sake! In thy righteousness, bring me out of my distress!
And, in thy compassion, cut off mine enemies, And destroy all that distress me! For I am thy servant.

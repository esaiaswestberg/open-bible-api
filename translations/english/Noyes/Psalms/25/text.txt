To thee, O LORD! do I lift up my soul.
O my God! I trust in thee; let me not be put to shame! Let not my enemies triumph over me!
Yea, none that hope in thee shall be put to shame: They shall be put to shame who wickedly forsake thee.
Cause me to know thy ways, O LORD! Teach me thy paths!
Lead me in thy truth, and teach me! For thou art the God from whom cometh my help; In thee do I trust at all times!
Remember thy loving-kindness, O LORD! and thy tender mercy, Which thou hast exercised of old!
Remember not the faults and transgressions of my youth! According to thy mercy remember thou me, For thy goodness’ sake, O LORD!
Good and righteous is the LORD; Therefore showeth he to sinners the way.
The humble he guideth in his statutes, And the humble he teacheth his way.
All the doings of the LORD are mercy and truth To those who keep his covenant and his precepts.
For thy name’s sake, O LORD, Pardon my iniquity; for it is great!
Who is the man that feareth the LORD? Him doth he show the way which he should choose.
He shall himself dwell in prosperity, And his offspring shall inherit the land.
The friendship of the LORD is with them that fear him, And he will teach them his covenant.
Mine eyes are ever directed to the LORD, For he will pluck my feet from the net.
Look upon me, and pity me; For I am desolate and afflicted!
Lighten the sorrows of my heart, And deliver me from my troubles!
Look upon my affliction and distress, And forgive all my sins!
Consider how many are my enemies, And with what violence they hate me!
Guard thou my life, and deliver me! Let me not be put to shame, for I have trusted in thee!
Let integrity and uprightness preserve me, For on thee do I rest my hope!
Redeem Israel, O God! from all his troubles!

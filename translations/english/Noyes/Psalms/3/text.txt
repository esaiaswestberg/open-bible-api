How many, O LORD, are mine enemies! How many are they who rise up against me!
How many are they who say of me, "There is no help for him with God"! [Pause.]
But thou, O LORD! art my shield, My glory, and the lifter-up of my head.
I call upon the LORD with my voice, And he heareth me from his holy hill. [Pause.]
I lay me down and sleep; I awake, for the LORD sustaineth me.
I will not fear the ten thousands of people Who on every side set themselves against me.
Arise, O LORD! Save me, O my God! For thou smitest the cheek of all my enemies; Thou breakest the teeth of the wicked.
Deliverance cometh from the LORD: May thy blessing be with thy people! [Pause.]

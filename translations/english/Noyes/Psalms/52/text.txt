Why gloriest thou in mischief, thou man of violence? The goodness of God yet continueth daily.
Thy tongue deviseth mischief, Like a sharp razor, thou contriver of deceit!
Thou lovest evil more than good, And to lie more than to speak truth. [Pause.]
Thou lovest all devouring words, O thou deceitful tongue!
Thee also shall God utterly destroy! o He shall seize thee, and tear thee from thy dwelling-place, And uproot thee from the land of the living. [Pause.]
The righteous shall see and fear, And shall laugh at him.
"Behold the man that made not God his strength, But trusted in the abundance of his riches, And placed his strength in his wickedness!"
But I shall be like a green olive-tree in the house of God; I will trust in the goodness of God for ever and ever.
I will praise thee for ever for what thou hast done; I will trust in thy name, because it is good, Before the eyes of thy godly ones!

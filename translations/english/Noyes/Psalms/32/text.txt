Happy is he whose transgression is forgiven, whose sin is pardoned!
Happy the man to whom the LORD imputeth not iniquity, And in whose spirit there is no guile!
While I kept silence, my bones were wasted, By reason of my groaning all the day long.
For day and night thy hand was heavy upon me; My moisture dried up, as in summer’s drought.
At length I acknowledged to thee my sin, And did not hide my iniquity. I said, "I will confess my transgression to the LORD;" And thou forgavest the iniquity of my sin! [Pause.]
Therefore shall every pious man pray to thee, while thou mayst be found; Surely the floods of great waters shall not come near him.
Thou art my hiding-place; thou preservest me from trouble; Thou compassest me about with songs of deliverance. [Pause.]
I will instruct thee, and show thee the way thou shouldst go; I will give thee counsel, and keep mine eye upon thee.
Be ye not like the horse and the mule, which have no understanding, Whose mouths must be pressed with the bridle and curb, Because they will not come near thee!
The wicked hath many sorrows; But he that trusteth in the LORD is encompassed with mercies.
Rejoice in the LORD, and be glad, ye righteous; Shout for joy, all ye that are upright in heart!

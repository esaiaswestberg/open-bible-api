Rejoice, O ye righteous, in the LORD! For praise becometh the upright.
Praise the LORD with the harp; Sing to him with the ten-stringed psaltery!
Sing to him a new song; Play skilfully amid the sound of trumpets!
For the word of the LORD is right, And all his acts are faithful.
He loveth justice and equity; The earth is full of the goodness of the LORD.
By the word of the LORD were the heavens made, And all the hosts of them by the breath of his mouth.
He gathereth the waters of the sea, as a heap; He layeth up the deep in storehouses.
Let all the earth fear the LORD; Let all the inhabitants of the world stand in awe of him!
For he spake, and it was done; He commanded, and it stood fast.
The LORD bringeth the devices of the nations to nothing; He frustrateth the designs of kingdoms.
The purposes of the LORD stand for ever; The designs of his heart, to all generations.
Happy the nation whose God is Jehovah; The people whom he hath chosen for his inheritance.
The LORD looketh down from heaven; He beholdeth all the children of men;
From his dwelling-place he beholdeth all the inhabitants of the earth,—
He that formed the hearts of all, And observeth all their works.
A king is not saved by the number of his forces, Nor a hero by the greatness of his strength.
The horse is a vain thing for safety, Nor can he deliver his master by his great strength.
Behold, the eye of the LORD is upon them that fear him,—Upon them that trust in his goodness;
To save them from the power of death, And keep them alive in famine.
The hope of our souls is in the LORD; He is our help and our shield.
Yea, in him doth our heart rejoice; In his holy name we have confidence.
May thy goodness be upon us, O LORD! According as we trust in thee!

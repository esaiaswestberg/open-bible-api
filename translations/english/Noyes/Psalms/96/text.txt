O sing to Jehovah a new song; Sing to Jehovah, all the earth!
Sing to Jehovah; praise his name, Show forth his salvation from day to day!
Proclaim his glory among the nations, His wonders among all people!
For Jehovah is great, and greatly to be praised; He is to be feared above all gods.
For all the gods of the nations are idols; But Jehovah made the heavens.
Honor and majesty are before him; Glory and beauty are in his holy abode.
Give to Jehovah, ye tribes of the people, Give to Jehovah glory and praise!
Give to Jehovah the glory due to his name; Bring an offering, and come into his courts!
O worship Jehovah in holy attire! Tremble before him, all the earth!
Say among the nations, Jehovah is king; The world shall stand firm; it shall not be moved; He will judge the nations in righteousness.
Let the heavens be glad, and the earth rejoice; Let the sea roar, and the fulness thereof;
Let the fields be joyful, with all that is therein; Let all the trees of the forest rejoice
Before Jehovah! for he cometh, He cometh to judge the earth! He will judge the world with justice, And the nations with faithfulness.

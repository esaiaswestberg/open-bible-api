The fool saith in his heart, "There is no God." They are corrupt; abominable are their doings; There is none that doeth good.
Jehovah looketh down from heaven upon the children of men, To see if there are any that have understanding, That have regard to God.
They are all gone out of the way; together are they corrupt; There is none that doeth good—no, not one.
Shall not the evil-doers be requited, Who devour my people like bread, And call not upon Jehovah?
Yea, then shall they be in great fear; For Jehovah is with the race of the righteous.
Ye would put to shame the counsel of the poor; But Jehovah is their refuge.
Oh that salvation for Israel would come out of Zion! When Jehovah bringeth back the captives of his people, Then shall Jacob rejoice, and Israel be glad.

It is a good thing to give thanks to the LORD, And to sing praises to thy name, O Most High!
To show forth thy loving-kindness in the morning, And thy faithfulness every night,
Upon the ten-stringed instrument and the lute, Upon the harp with a solemn sound.
For thou, LORD, hast made me glad by thy doings; In the works of thy hands I greatly rejoice!
How great are thy works, O LORD! How deep thy purposes!
But the unwise man knoweth not this, And the fool understandeth it not.
When the wicked spring up like grass, And all who practise iniquity flourish, It is but to be destroyed for ever!
Thou, O LORD! art for ever exalted!
For, lo! thine enemies, O LORD! For, lo! thine enemies perish, And dispersed are all who do iniquity!
But my horn thou exaltest like the buffalo’s; I am anointed with fresh oil.
Mine eye hath gazed with joy upon mine enemies; Mine ears have heard with joy of my wicked adversaries.
The righteous shall flourish like the palm-tree; They shall grow up like the cedars of Lebanon;
Planted in the house of the LORD, They shall flourish in the courts of our God.
Even in old age they bring forth fruit; They are green, and full of sap;
To show that the LORD, my rock, is upright, That there is no unrighteousness in him.

To the king, O God! give thy justice, And to the son of a king thy righteousness!
Yea! he shall judge thy people with equity, And thine oppressed ones with justice.
For the mountains shall bring forth peace to the people, And the hills, through righteousness.
He shall defend the oppressed of the people; He shall save the needy, And break in pieces the oppressor.
They shall fear thee as long as the sun and moon shall endure, From generation to generation.
He shall be like rain descending on the mown field,—Like showers which water the earth.
In his days shall the righteous flourish, And great shall be their prosperity, as long as the moon shall endure.
He shall have dominion from sea to sea, And from the river to the ends of the earth.
They that dwell in the desert shall bow before him, And his enemies shall lick the dust.
The kings of Tarshish and of the isles shall bring presents; The kings of Sheba and Seba shall offer gifts;
Yea, all kings shall fall down before him; All nations shall serve him.
For he shall deliver the poor who crieth for aid, And the oppressed who hath no helper.
He shall spare the weak and needy, And save the lives of the poor.
He shall redeem them from deceit and violence, And their blood shall be precious in his sight.
He shall prosper, and to him shall be given of the gold of Sheba; Prayer also shall be made for him continually, And daily shall he be praised.
There shall be an abundance of corn in the land; Its fruit shall shake like Lebanon, even on the tops of the mountains; And they of the cities shall flourish as the grass of the earth.
His name shall endure for ever; His name shall be continued as long as the sun. By him shall men bless themselves; All nations shall call him blessed.
[Praised be God, Jehovah, the God of Israel, Who alone doeth wonderful things!
Praised be his glorious name for ever! May his glory fill the whole earth! Amen, Amen!
Here end the Psalms of David, the son of Jesse.]

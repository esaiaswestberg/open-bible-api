O Jehovah, my God! to thee do I look for help; Save me from them that persecute me, and deliver me!
Lest mine enemy tear me like a lion; Lest he rend me in pieces, while there is none to help.
O Jehovah, my God! if I have done this,—If there be iniquity upon my hands,
If I have rendered evil to my friend, Or have despoiled him that without cause is mine enemy,—
Let my adversary pursue and take me; Let him trample me to the ground, And lay me prostrate in the dust! [Pause.]
Arise, O LORD! in thine anger; Lift thyself up against the rage of mine enemies; Awake for me, ordain judgment!
Let the assembly of the nations compass thee about, And on their account return to the height!
The LORD judgeth the nations; Judge me, O LORD! according to my righteousness, And requite me according to my integrity!
Oh, let the wickedness of the wicked be at an end; But establish the righteous! For the righteous God trieth the heart and the reins.
My shield is with God, Who saveth the upright in heart.
God is a righteous judge, And a God who is angry every day.
If he do not desist, He sharpeneth his sword; He bendeth his bow, and maketh it ready;
He prepareth for him the instruments of death; He shooteth his burning arrows.
Behold, he travailed with iniquity, And conceived mischief, But hath brought forth disappointment!
He made a pit and digged it. And is fallen into the ditch which he made.
His mischief returneth upon his own head, And his violence cometh down upon his own skull.
I will praise the LORD according to his righteousness; I will sing praise to the name of the LORD most high.

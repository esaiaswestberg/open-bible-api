The LORD is my light and my salvation; Whom shall I fear? The LORD is the shield of my life; Of whom shall I be afraid?
When the wicked came upon me to devour me, Even my persecutors and enemies, they stumbled and fell.
Though a host should encamp against me, my heart shall not fear; Though war should rise against me, yet will I be confident.
One thing have I desired of the LORD; that do I yet seek; That I may dwell in the house of the LORD all the days of my life, To behold the grace of the LORD, And to gaze upon his temple.
For in the day of trouble he will hide me in his pavilion; Yea, in the secret place of his tabernacle will he shelter me; He will set me upon a rock.
Yea, already doth he lift my head above my enemies, who are around me; Therefore in his tabernacle will I offer sacrifices with the sound of trumpets; I will sing, yea, with instruments of music I will give praise to the LORD.
Hear my voice, O LORD! when I cry unto thee; Have pity upon me, and answer me!
When I think of thy precept, "Seek ye my face!" Thy face, LORD, do I seek.
O hide not thou thy face from me; Cast not thy servant away in displeasure! Thou hast been my help, do not leave me; Do not forsake me, O God, my helper!
For my father and my mother have forsaken me; But the LORD will take me up.
Teach me thy way, O LORD! And lead me in the right path, because of my enemies!
Give me not up to the will of my adversaries! For false witnesses have risen up against me, And such as breathe out injustice.
I trust that I shall see the goodness of the LORD In the land of the living. Hope thou in the LORD!
Be of good courage; let thy heart be strong; Hope thou in the LORD!

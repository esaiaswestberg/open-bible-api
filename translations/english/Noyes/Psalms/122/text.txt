I was glad when they said to me, Let us go up to the house of the LORD!
Our feet are standing Within thy gates, O Jerusalem!
Jerusalem, the rebuilt city! The city that is joined together!
Thither the tribes go up, The tribes of the LORD, according to the law of Israel, To praise the name of the LORD.
There stand the thrones of judgment, The thrones of the house of David.
Pray for the peace of Jerusalem! May they prosper who love thee!
Peace be within thy walls, And prosperity within thy palaces!
For my brethren and companions’ sake will I say, Peace be within thee!
For the sake of the house of the LORD, our God, Will I seek thy good!

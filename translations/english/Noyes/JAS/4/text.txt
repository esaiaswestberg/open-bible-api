Whence are wars and whence are fightings among you? Are they not hence, from your lusts that war in your members?
Ye lust, and have not; ye kill, and earnestly covet, and cannot obtain; ye fight and war. Ye have not, because ye ask not;
ye ask, and receive not, because ye ask amiss, that ye may consume it upon your lusts.
Ye adulteresses, know ye not that the friendship of the world is enmity with God? Whoever therefore chooseth to be a friend of the world, becometh an enemy of God.
Do ye think that the scripture saith in vain, "Zealously doth the Spirit, which made its abode in us, long for us"?
but he giveth more grace. Wherefore he saith, "God resisteth the proud, but giveth grace to the humble."
Submit yourselves therefore to God; resist the Devil, and he will flee from you.
Draw nigh to God, and he will draw nigh to you. Cleanse your hands, ye sinners, and purify your hearts, ye double-minded.
Be afflicted, and mourn, and weep; let your laughter be turned into mourning, and your joy into heaviness.
Humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord, and he will exalt you.
Speak not against one another, brethren; he that speaketh against his brother, or judgeth his brother, speaketh against the law, and judgeth the law; but if thou judge the law, thou art not a doer of the law, but a judge.
One is the Lawgiver and Judge, he who is able to save, and to destroy; but who art thou, that judgest thy neighbor?
Come now, ye that say, To-day and to-morrow we will go into such a city, and spend a year there and traffic, and get gain,
(whereas ye know not what will be on the morrow; for what is your life? Ye are even a vapor, that appeareth for a little time, and then vanisheth away;)
instead of saying, If the Lord will, we shall both live and do this or that;
but now ye glory in your boastings. All such glorying is evil.
Therefore to him that knoweth how to do good, and doeth it not, to him it is sin.

When Israel was a child, I loved him, And called my son out of Egypt,
But they turned away from those that called them. They sacrificed to images of Baal; They burned incense to idols.
I helped Ephraim to go, Yea, I took them up in my arms; Yet they marked not that I healed them.
I drew them with human cords, with bands of love; I was to them as those who lift up the yoke from their jaws; I dealt gently with them, and gave them food.
They shall no more go down to Egypt; For the Assyrian shall be their king, Because they refuse to return to me.
The sword shall fall upon their cities, It shall consume their bars, and devour Because of their devices.
For my people persevere in turning away from me; Though they are called to the Most High, None will exalt him.
How shall I give thee up, Ephraim? How shall I abandon thee, Israel? How shall I make thee as Admah? How shall I set thee as Zeboim? My heart is changed within me; Yea, my compassion is kindled.
I will not execute the fierceness of mine anger; I will not again destroy Ephraim; For I am God, and not man, The Holy One in the midst of thee, And I will not come in anger.
They shall walk after Jehovah, when he shall roar like a lion, When he shall roar, then shall their sons hasten from the west;
They shall hasten as a bird from Egypt, And as a dove from the land of Assyria, And I will place them in their houses, saith Jehovah.
Ephraim compasseth me about with falsehood, And the house of Israel with deceit; Judah also is inconstant toward God, Toward the holy and faithful one.

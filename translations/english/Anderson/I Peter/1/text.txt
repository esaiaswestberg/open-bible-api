Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, to the sojourners that are dispersed through Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia,
elect according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, by the sanctification of the Spirit, in order to obedience, and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ: grace be to you, and peace be multiplied.
Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who, according to his abundant mercy, has, by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead, regenerated us for a living hope
in respect to an inheritance incorruptible, and undefiled, and that fades not away, reserved in heaven for us,
who are kept secure by the power of God through faith, to a salvation ready to be revealed in the last time:
in which you rejoice, though now for a little while, since it is needful, you are in sorrow under various temptations;
that your faith, when proved, being much more precious than gold, which perishes though it be tried by fire, may be found to be for praise and honor and glory, at the revelation of Jesus Christ;
whom, though you have not seen him, yet you love; on whom not now looking, but believing, you rejoice with joy unspeakable, and full of glory,
receiving the end of your faith, the salvation of your souls.
Concerning which salvation the prophets that prophesied of the grace that should be for you, did inquire, and search diligently,
inquiring what things, and what time, the Spirit of Christ that was in them did signify, when it testified, beforehand, the sufferings of Christ, and the glories that should follow them;
to whom it was revealed, that, not for themselves, but for us, they ministered the things that are now preached to you by those who have made known to you the gospel, through the Holy Spirit sent down from heaven; into which things angels desire to look.
Wherefore, gird up the loins of your mind; be watchful, and hope constantly for the grace that is to be brought to you at the revelation of Jesus Christ:
as obedient children, not conforming yourselves to the desires which you formerly had in your ignorance;
but as he who has called you is holy, so be you holy in all your behavior:
because it is written, Be you holy, for I am holy.
And since you call on the Father, who, without respect of persons, judges according to every man’s work, pass the time of your sojourning in fear:
because you know that you were not redeemed with corruptible things, as silver or gold, from your vain mode of life received by tradition from your fathers,
but with the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb without spot and blemish,
who was indeed foreordained before the foundation of the world, but manifested in these last times for you,
who through him do believe in God who raised him from the dead, and gave him glory, that your faith and hope might be in God.
Having purified your souls in obeying the truth through the Spirit, to unfeigned love of the brethren, love one another with a pure heart fervently,
having been begotten again, not with corruptible seed, but with incorruptible, by the word of God, which lives and abides forever.
For all flesh is as grass, and all the glory of man as the flower of grass; the grass withers, and its flower fails away: but the word of the Lord abides forever: and this is the word which has been preached as gospel to you.

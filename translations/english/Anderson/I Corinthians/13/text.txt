Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, but have not love, I have become as sounding brass, or a clanging cymbal.
And though I have the gift of prophecy, and understand all mysteries, and all knowledge; and though I have all faith, so that I could remove mountains, and have not love, I am nothing.
And though I give all my goods to feed the poor, and though I deliver up my body to be burned, and have not love, I am profited nothing.
Love suffers long, and is kind; love envies not; love boasts not; is not vain,
does nothing unbecoming, seeks not her own, is not easily provoked, thinks no evil,
rejoices not in iniquity, but rejoices in the truth;
bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things.
Love never fails; but whether there be gifts of prophecy, they shall have an end; or tongues, they shall cease; or knowledge, it shall have an end.
For we know in part, and we prophesy in part;
but when that which is perfect has come, then that which is in part shall have an end.
When I was a child, I spoke as a child, I had the mind of a child, I thought as a child; but when I became a man, I put away childish things.
Now we see through a mirror, obscurely; but then, face to face; now I know in part, but then shall I know, even as I am known.
And now abide faith, hope, love, these three; but the greatest of these is love.

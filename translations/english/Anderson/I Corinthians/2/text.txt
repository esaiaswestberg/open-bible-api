And I, brethren, when I came to you, came not with excellence of speech or of wisdom, declaring to you the testimony of God.
For I determined not to know any thing among you but Jesus Christ, and him crucified.
And I was with you in weakness, and in fear, and in much trembling:
and my speech and my preaching were not in persuasive words of man’s wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power,
that your faith might not be in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God.
Yet we speak wisdom among the perfect; but not the wisdom of this age, nor of the rulers of this age, who are brought to nought:
but we speak God’s wisdom in a mystery, even that which had been hidden, which God predestined before the ages, for our glory,
which none of the rulers of this age knew; for, had they known it, they would not have crucified the Lord of Glory.
But, as it is written: Eye has not seen, and ear has not heard, and into the heart of man have not entered the things which God has prepared for them that love him.
But God has revealed them to us through his Spirit; for the Spirit searches all things, even the deep things of God.
For what man knows the things of man, but the spirit of man which is in him? Even so, the things of God no one knows, but the Spirit of God.
And we have received, not the spirit of the world, but the Spirit which is from God, that we may know the things that are freely given to us by God:
which things also we speak, not in words taught by man’s wisdom, but in words taught by the Spirit, comparing spiritual things with spiritual things.
But an animal man receives not the things of the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness to him, and he can not know them, because they are spiritually discerned.
But the spiritual man discerns all things; yet he himself is discerned by no one.
For who has known the mind of the Lord, that he may instruct him? But we have the mind of Christ.

Paul and Sylvanus and Timothy to the church of the Thessalonians in God our Father and in the Lord Jesus Christ:
grace be to you, and peace from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ.
We are bound to give thanks to God always for you, brethren, as it is right, because your faith grows exceedingly, and the love of every one of you all toward each other abounds:
so that we ourselves glory in you, among the churches of God, for your patience and faith in all your persecutions and afflictions which you endure;
which endurance of yours is a proof of the righteous judgment of God, in order that you may be counted worthy of the kingdom of God, for which you suffer:
since, indeed, it is a righteous thing with God, to repay affliction to those who afflict you,
and to you that are afflicted, rest with us, at the revelation of our Lord Jesus from heaven with his mighty angels,
in flaming fire, to take vengeance on those who know not God, and who obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ;
these shall suffer punishment in that day, even eternal destruction, far from the presence of the Lord, and from the glory of his power,
when he shall come to be glorified in his saints, and to be admired in all those who believe, and in you also, because our testimony among you was believed.
In order to which, we also pray always for you, that our God may count you worthy of this calling, and may fulfill all the good pleasure of his goodness, and the work of faith with power,
that the name of our Lord Jesus Christ may be glorified in you, and you in him, according to the grace of our God, and the Lord Jesus Christ.

But, we beseech you, brethren, concerning the coming of; our Lord Jesus Christ, and our coming together to him,
that you be not hastily shaken from the persuasion of your mind, nor be troubled, neither by spirit, nor by report, nor by letter as written by us, as though the day of the Lord is at hand.
Let no one deceive you by any means; for that day will not come, unless the apostasy come first, and the man of sin be revealed, the son of perdition,
who opposes and exalts himself above every one that is called God, or that is worshiped, so that he sits as God in the temple of God, openly showing him self that he is God.
Do you not remember that, while I was with you, I told you these things?
And now you know what restrains, in order that he may be revealed in his own proper time.
For the mystery of iniquity is already at work; only he that now restrains will restrain, till he be taken out of the way:
and then shall that lawless one be revealed, whom the Lord Jesus will destroy by the spirit of his mouth, and will utterly overthrow by the brightness of his coming:
he will destroy him, whose coming is, according to the energy of Satan, with all power and signs and wonders of falsehood,
and with all the delusion of unrighteousness in those who perish, because they did not receive the love of the truth, in order that they might be saved.
And for this reason God will send them strong delusion, in order that they may believe a lie,
that all may be condemned who believe not the truth, but have pleasure in unrighteousness.
But we are bound to give thanks to God always for you, brethren, beloved of the Lord, because God did, from the beginning, choose you to salvation, by sanctification of the Spirit and belief of the truth,
to which he called you by our gospel, in order that you might obtain the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ.
Therefore, brethren, stand fast, and hold the traditions which you have been taught, whether by word or by our letter.
Now may our Lord Jesus Christ himself, and God, even our Father, who has loved us, and given us eternal consolation and good hope through grace,
comfort your hearts, and strengthen you in every good word and work.

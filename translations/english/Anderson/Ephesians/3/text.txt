For this reason, I Paul, the prisoner of the Christ Jesus on account of you Gentiles,
if, indeed, you have heard of the stewardship of the grace of God, which was given to me for your benefit,
that by revelation was made known to me the mystery, (as I briefly wrote above,
so that, when you read, you can see my understanding in the mystery of the Christ,)
which, in other generations, was not made known to the sons of men, as it is now revealed to his holy apostles and prophets by the Spirit;
that the Gentiles should be fellow-heirs, and of the same body, and partakers of his promise in the Christ, through the gospel,
of which I was made a minister according to the gift of the grace of God which was given to me, in proportion to the energy of his power:
to me, who am by far the least of all the saints, has this grace been given, that I might preach among the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of the Christ,
and enlighten all men with respect to the plan of the mystery, which was concealed from the ages in God, who created all things;
to the end that the manifold wisdom of God might now be made known, through the church, to the principalities and authorities in the heavenly regions,
according to the arrangement of the ages, which he established by Christ Jesus our Lord,
in whom we have boldness and access with confidence, through our faith in him.
For which cause I beseech you not to grow faint on account of my afflictions for you, which are your glory.
For this reason I bow my knees to the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,
from whom the whole family in heaven and on earth is named,
that he may grant to you, according to the riches of his glory, to be mightily strengthened by his Spirit in the inner man,
that Christ may dwell in your hearts through the faith;
that, being rooted and founded in love, you may be fully able to comprehend with all the saints what is the breadth and length and depth and hight,
and to know the love of the Christ that passes our knowledge, that you may be filled with aft the fullness of God.
Now to him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think according to his power which works in us,
to him be glory in the church by Christ Jesus, throughout all the generations of the age of ages. Amen.

But do you speak the things that become sound teaching;
that the aged men be vigilant, grave, sober-minded, sound in faith, in love, in patience;
that the aged women likewise be, in deportment, as it becomes holy women, not slanderers, not enslaved to much wine, teachers of good things,
That they may teach the young women to be sober-minded, to love their husbands, to love their children,
to be discreet, chaste, fond of home, good, obedient to their own husbands, that the word of God be not reviled.
Exhort the young men likewise to be sober-minded,
in all things showing yourself an example of good works; in teaching, showing incorruptness, gravity,
sound speech that can not be condemned; that he that is opposed may be ashamed, seeing he has no evil thing to say of us.
Exhort servants to be subject to their own masters, and to please them well in all things, not contradicting,
not stealing, but showing all good faithfulness, that they may adorn the teaching of God our Savior in all things.
For the grace of God, which brings salvation to all men, has appeared,
teaching us, that denying ungodliness and worldly desires, we should live soberly and righteously and godly in the present age;
looking for the blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of our great God and Savior Jesus Christ,
who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify for himself a peculiar people, zealous of good works.
Speak these things, and exhort and rebuke with all strictness. Let no one despise you.

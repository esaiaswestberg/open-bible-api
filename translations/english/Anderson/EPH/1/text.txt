Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, to the saints that are in Ephesus, and the faithful in Christ Jesus:
grace be to you, and peace from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ.
Praised be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in heavenly things in Christ,
according as he chose us in him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and blameless before him in love,
having predestinated us for adoption to himself through Jesus Christ, according to the good pleasure of his will,
for the praise of the glory of his grace, by which he has shown us favor in the Beloved,
in whom we have redemption through his blood, even the remission of sins, according to the riches of his grace,
which he has made to abound to us in all wisdom and understanding,
by making known to us the mystery of his will according to his good purpose which he had before established in himself,
for a dispensation at the fullness of the times, in order that he might bring together for himself all things in the Christ, both those which are in the heavens, and those which are on earth;
in him in whom we have obtained our portion, having been predestinated according to the purpose of him who works all things according to the counsel of his will,
that we should be for the praise of his glory; even we, who before had hope in the Christ:
in whom you also hoped after you heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation: in whom, after you also believed, you were sealed with the Holy Spirit of promise,
which is the earnest of our inheritance, given for the redemption of his possession to the praise of his glory.
For this reason I also, since I have heard of your faith in the Lord Jesus, and your love to all the saints,
do not cease to give thanks for you, making mention of you in my prayers,
that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give you the spirit of wisdom and of revelation in the acknowledgment of him,
that, the eyes of your understanding being enlightened, you may know what is the hope of his calling, and what are the glorious riches of his inheritance in the saints,
and what is the exceeding greatness of his power to ward us who believe in accordance with the energy of his mighty power,
which he made active in the Christ when he raised him from the dead, and caused him to sit at his right hand in the heavenly places,
high above every principality and authority and power and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this age, but also in that which is to come;
and subjected all things under his feet, and made him head over all things for the church,
which is his body, the fullness of him who fills all his members with all things,

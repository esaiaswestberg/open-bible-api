This is a true saying: If any desires the office of a bishop, he desires a good work.
A bishop, then, must be blameless, the husband of one wife, watchful, soberminded, modest, hospitable, able to teach,
not fond of wine, not quarrelsome, not one who makes money by base means; but gentle, not contentious, not covetous;
one that rules his own house well; having his children in subjection with all gravity:
for if a man knows not how to rule his own house, how will he take care of the church of God?
Not a new convert, lest, having become conceited, he fall into the condemnation of the devil.
Further, he must have a good reputation from those who are without, lest he fall into reproach and the snare of the devil.
The deacons, likewise, must be grave, not double-tongued, not given to much wine, not makers of money by base means,
holding the mystery of the faith in a pure conscience.
And let these also be first proved, then let them become deacons, being blameless.
Their wives likewise must be grave, not slanderers, watchful, faithful in all things.
Let the deacons be the husbands of one wife, ruling their children and their own houses well.
For those who have filled the office of a deacon well, gain for themselves a good degree, and great boldness in the faith that is in Christ Jesus.
I write these things to you, hoping to come to you shortly;
but if I delay, that you may know how you ought to conduct yourself in the house of God, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and support of the truth.
And confessedly great is the mystery of godliness: God was manifest in flesh, justified in spirit, seen by angels, preached among the Gentiles, believed on in the world, received up in glory.

But know this, that in the last days trying times will come.
For men will be lovers of themselves, lovers of money, boasters, proud, revilers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy,
without natural affection, implacable, false accusers, intemperate, fierce, haters of those who are good,
traitors, rash, conceited, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God,
having a form of godliness, but denying its power: from these also turn away.
For of this sort are those who worm themselves into houses, and lead captive silly women that are laden with sins, and influenced by various desires,
that are always learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth.
Now as Jannes and Jambres withstood Moses, so these also will withstand the truth; men corrupt in mind, rejected as it respects the faith.
But they shall proceed no further; for their madness shall be manifest to all, as was the madness of those men.
But you have fully known my teaching, my course of life, my purpose, my faithfulness, my long-suffering, my love, my patience,
my persecutions, my sufferings which came upon me in Antioch, in Iconium, in Lystra; you well know what persecutions I endured: and yet out of them all, the Lord delivered me.
And all that will live godly in Christ Jesus, shall suffer persecution.
But evil men and impostors will become worse and worse, deceiving, and being deceived.
But do you continue in the things which you have learned and well understood, knowing from whom you learned them,
and that from a child you have known the holy scriptures, which are able to make you wise in order to salvation, through faith that is in Christ Jesus.
All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness, that the man of God may be perfect, thoroughly furnished for every good work.

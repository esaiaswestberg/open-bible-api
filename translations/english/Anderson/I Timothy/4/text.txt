Now the Spirit says expressly, that, in the last times, some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and teachings suggested by demons,
through the hypocrisy of liars, who are seared in their conscience,
who forbid to marry, and command to abstain from meats, which God has created to be received with thanksgiving by those who believe, and know the truth.
For every creature of God is good, and nothing is to be rejected, if it be received with thanksgiving;
for it is sanctified by the word of God, and by prayer.
By recommending these things to the attention of the brethren, you will be a good minister of Jesus Christ, being nourished with the words of the faith, and of good teaching, which you have fully known.
But reject those profane and old-womanish fables, and exercise yourself for godliness.
For the exercise of the body is profitable for little; but godliness is profitable for all things, and has the promise of the life that now is, and also of that which is to come.
This is a true saying, and worthy of all acceptation:
for to this end we both labor, and suffer reproach, because we trust in the living God, who is the Savior of all men, especially of those who believe.
These things command and teach.
Let no one despise your youth; but be an example to the believers, in word, in behavior, in love, in spirit, in faithfulness, in purity.
Till I come, give attention to reading, to exhortation, to teaching.
Neglect not the gift that is in you, which was given you according to prophecy, with the laying on of the hands of the eldership.
Meditate upon these things; give yourself wholly to them, that your advancement may be manifest in all things.
Take heed to yourself, and to your teaching; continue in them; for by doing this, you will save both yourself, and those who hear you.

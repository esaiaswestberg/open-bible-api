I exhort, therefore, first of all, that supplications, prayers, intercessions, and giving of thanks be made for all men,
for kings, and for all that are in authority, that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and gravity.
For this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Savior,
who is willing that all men should be saved, and come to the knowledge of the truth.
For there is one God, and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus,
who gave himself a ransom for all, of which the testimony has been given in its proper times,
to give which testimony I have been appointed a preacher and an apostle; (I speak the truth, and lie not;) a teacher of the Gentiles in faithfulness and in truth.
I will, therefore, that the men pray everywhere, lifting up holy hands without wrath and disputation.
In like manner, also, I will that the women adorn themselves with decorous dress, with modesty and sobriety, not with plaited hair, or gold, or pearls, or costly raiment,
but with good works; since this becomes women who profess godliness.
Let the woman learn in silence with all subjection.
I suffer not a woman to teach, nor to usurp authority over the man, but to be in silence.
For Adam was first formed, then Eve.
And Adam was not deceived: but the woman being deceived, was in transgression;
but they shall be saved by the bearing of children, if they continue in faith and love and holiness with sobriety.

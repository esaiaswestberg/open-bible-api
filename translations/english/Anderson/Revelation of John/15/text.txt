And I saw another sign in heaven, great and wonderful: seven angels that had seven plagues which are the last; for by them the wrath of God is brought to an end.
And I saw, as it were, a sea of glass mingled with fire, and those who had obtained the victory over the beast, and over his image, and over the number of his name, standing on the sea of glass, having the harps of God.
And they sung the song of Moses the servant of God, and the song of the Lamb, saying: Great and wonderful are thy works, Lord God Almighty; just and true are thy ways, thou King of saints.
Who will not fear thee, O Lord, and glorify thy name? For thou alone art holy; for all nations shall come and worship before thee: because thy judgments are made manifest.
And after this I saw, and the temple of the tabernacle of the testimony in heaven was opened;
and the seven angels that had the seven plagues came out of the temple, clothed in pure white linen, and girded about the breasts with golden girdles.
And one of the four living creatures gave to the seven angels seven golden cups full of the wrath of God, who lives from age to age.
And the temple was filled with smoke from the glory of God, and from his power; and no one was able to enter the temple, till the seven plagues of the seven angels were completed.

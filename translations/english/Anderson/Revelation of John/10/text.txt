And I saw another mighty angel coming down from heaven, clothed with a cloud; and the rainbow was upon his head, and his face was like the sun, and his feet like pillars of fire.
And he had in his hand a little book opened; and he placed his right foot on the sea, and his left foot on the land;
and he cried with a loud voice, as when a lion roars: and when he had cried, the seven thunders uttered their voices.
And when the seven thunders had spoken, I was about to write; and I heard a voice from heaven, saying: Seal up the things which the seven thunders spoke, and write them not.
And the angel that I saw standing on the sea and on the land, lifted up his right hand to heaven,
and swore by him that lives from age to age, who created the heaven and the things that are in it, and the earth and the things that are in it, and the sea and the things that are in it, That time should no longer intervene,
but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, when he shall sound his trumpet, the mystery of God should be finished, as he has declared to his servants the prophets.
And the voice that I heard from heaven spoke to me again, and said: Go and take the little book that is open in the hand of the angel that stands on the sea and on the land.
And I went to the angel, and said to him: Give me the little book. And he said to me: Take it, and eat it up, and it will make your stomach bitter, but it will be in your mouth as sweet as honey.
And I took the little book out of the angel’s hand, and ate it up, and it was in my mouth as sweet as honey; and when I had eaten it, my stomach was bitter.
And he said to me: You must prophesy again before many peoples and nations and tongues and kings.

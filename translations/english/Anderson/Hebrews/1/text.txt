God, who in many parts and in many ways spoke in ancient times to the fathers by the prophets, has in these last days spoken to us by his Son,
whom he has appointed heir of all things, by whom, also, he made the ages;
who, being the effulgence of his glory and the exact representation of his essence, and upholding all things by his own powerful word, when he had by himself made expiation for our sins, sat down at the right hand of the Majesty on high,
having become so far superior to the angels, as the name which he has inherited is more excellent than theirs.
For to which of the angels did he at any time say: Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee? And again: I will be to him a Father, and he shall be to me a Son?
And again, when he brings the first-begotten into the world, he says: And let all the angels of God worship him.
And of the angels he says: Who makes his angels winds, and his ministers a flame of fire.
But to the Son: Thy throne, O God, is from age to age: a scepter of rectitude is the scepter of thy kingdom.
Thou hast loved righteousness, and hated iniquity; therefore, God, thy God, has anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows.
And, Thou, Lord, in the beginning, didst lay the foundation of the earth, and the heavens are the works of thy hands.
They shall perish; but thou remainest: and they all shall grow old as a garment;
and as a mantle thou shalt fold them up, and they shall be changed; but thou art the same, and thy years shall not fail.
But to which of the angels has he said at any time: Sit on my right hand, till I make thy enemies thy footstool?
Are they not all ministering spirits, sent forth to minister to those who shall inherit salvation?

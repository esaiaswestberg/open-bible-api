The third time am I coming to you. By the mouth of two or three witnesses, every matter shall be established.
I have foretold, and now the second time, as if I was present, though being absent, I foretell to those who have sinned, and to all others, that, if I come again, I will not spare;
since you seek a proof of Christ’s speaking in me, who toward you is not weak, but who is mighty in you:
for though he was crucified in weakness, yet he lives by the power of God. For we also are weak in him, but we shall live with him by the power of God toward you.
Make trial of yourselves, whether you are in the faith; put yourselves to the proof. Do you not know your own selves, that Christ Jesus is in you? unless you be without proof.
But I hope that you will know that we are not without proof.
Yet I pray to God that you may do no evil; not that we may appear as having proof, but that you may do what is good, though we be as without proof.
For we can do nothing against the truth, but we can do something for the truth.
For we rejoice when we are weak, and you are strong. And we pray also for this―your perfection.
For this reason, I write these things, while absent, that I may not, when present, use severity, according to the authority which the Lord has given me for edification, and not for destruction.
Finally, brethren, farewell; be perfect, be comforted, be of the same mind, be at peace; and the God of love and of peace will be with you.
Salute one another with a holy kiss. All the saints salute you.
The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the communion of the Holy Spirit, be with you all.

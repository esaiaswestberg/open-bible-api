Whence come wars and strifes among you? Come they not hence, even of your passions, which war in your members?
You desire, and you have not; you kill, and are earnestly desirous of having, and yet you can not obtain; you fight and war, and yet you have not, because you ask not.
You ask, and receive not, because you ask amiss, that you may spend it on your passions.
Adulterers and adulteresses, know you not that the friendship of the world is enmity to God? Whoever, therefore, will be a friend of the world, is an enemy of God.

But he gives more grace. Wherefore he says: God sets himself against the proud, but gives grace to the lowly.
Submit yourselves, therefore, to God; resist the devil, and he will flee from you;
draw near to God, and he will draw near to you. Cleanse your hands, you sinners, and purify your hearts, you double-minded men.
Be afflicted, and mourn, and weep: let your laughter be turned to mourning, and your joy to sorrow.
Humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord, and he will exalt you.

Come, now, you that say, Let us go to-day, or to-morrow, into this city, and remain there a year, and trade, and make gain;
and yet you know not what will take place to-morrow. For what is your life? Is it not, indeed, a vapor, that appears for a little while, and then vanishes away?
Instead of that, you ought to say, If the Lord will, we shall live, and do this, or that.
But now you glory in your boastings: all such glorying is evil.
Therefore, to him that knows how to do good, and does it not, to him it is sin.

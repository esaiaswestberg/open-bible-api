Brethren, if a man be overtaken in any fault, do you, who are spiritual, restore such a one in the spirit of meekness, considering yourself, lest you also be tempted.
Bear with the weaknesses of one another, and so fulfill the law of Christ.
For if any one think himself to be something when he is nothing, he deceives himself:
but let each one prove his own work, and then he will have cause to boast with respect to himself only, and not with respect to another:
for each one shall bear his own burden.
Let him that is instructed in the word share with his instructor in all good things.
Be not deceived; God is not mocked. For whatever a man sows, that also shall he reap.
For he that sows for his flesh shall from the flesh, reap corruption; but he that sows for his spirit shall from the Spirit reap life eternal.
Let us not become weary in well doing: for in due season we shall reap, if we faint not.
Therefore, as we have opportunity, let us do good to all, but especially to those who are the household of the faith.
You see how long a letter I have written to you with my own hand.
As many as wish to make a fair show in the flesh, these compel you to be circumcised, only that they may not suffer persecution for the cross of the Christ.
For not even do those very men, who are circumcised, keep the law: but they wish you to be circumcised, that they may boast in your flesh.
But may I never boast save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom the world has been crucified to me, and I to the world.
For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision is any thing, nor uncircumcision, but a new creature.
And as many as walk by this rule, peace and mercy be upon them, and upon the Israel of God.
Henceforward let no one give me trouble: for I bear in my body the wounds which I received on account of the Lord Jesus.
Brethren, the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen.

It is generally reported that there is lewdness among you; and such lewdness as is not even mentioned among the Gentiles―that a certain one has his father’s wife.
And you are puffed up, and have not rather mourned, that he that has done this deed might be taken from among you.
For I, indeed, as absent in body, but present in spirit, have already, as if I were present, judged him that has so done this thing;
in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, when you and my spirit have come together, with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ,
that we deliver such a one over to Satan, for the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus.
Your boasting is not good; know you not that a little leaven leavens the whole mass?
Purge out the old leaven, that you may be a new mass, as you are without leaven; for Christ, our passover, has been sacrificed for us.
Therefore, let us keep the feast, not with old leaven, nor with the leaven of malice and wickedness, but with the unleavened bread of purity and truth.
I have written to you in the letter not to associate with lewd persons;
yet without the lest allusion to the lewd, or the covetous, or the extortioners, or the idolaters of this world; for then you must go out of the world;
but now I write to you, not to associate with any one professing to be a brother, if he is lewd or covetous, or an idolater, or a reviler, or a drunkard, or an extortioner: with such a one not even to eat.
For what right have I to judge those who are without? Do you not judge those who are within?
But God will judge those who are without. So then judge, and put away that wicked man from among you.

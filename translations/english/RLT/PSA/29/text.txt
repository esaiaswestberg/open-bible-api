Give unto Yhwh, O ye mighty, give unto Yhwh glory and strength.
Give unto Yhwh the glory due unto his name; worship Yhwh in the beauty of holiness.
The voice of Yhwh is upon the waters: the God of glory thundereth: Yhwh is upon many waters.
The voice of Yhwh is powerful; the voice of Yhwh is full of majesty.
The voice of Yhwh breaketh the cedars; yea, Yhwh breaketh the cedars of Lebanon.
He maketh them also to skip like a calf; Lebanon and Sirion like a young unicorn.
The voice of Yhwh divideth the flames of fire.
The voice of Yhwh shaketh the wilderness; Yhwh shaketh the wilderness of Kadesh.
The voice of Yhwh maketh the hinds to calve, and discovereth the forests: and in his temple doth every one speak of his glory.
Yhwh sitteth upon the flood; yea, Yhwh sitteth King for ever.
Yhwh will give strength unto his people; Yhwh will bless his people with peace.

O Yhwh, rebuke me not in thine anger, neither chasten me in thy hot displeasure.
Have mercy upon me, O Yhwh; for I am weak: O Yhwh, heal me; for my bones are vexed.
My soul is also sore vexed: but thou, O Yhwh, how long?
Return, O Yhwh, deliver my soul: oh save me for thy mercies’ sake.
For in death there is no remembrance of thee: in the grave who shall give thee thanks?
I am weary with my groaning; all the night make I my bed to swim; I water my couch with my tears.
Mine eye is consumed because of grief; it waxeth old because of all mine enemies.
Depart from me, all ye workers of iniquity; for Yhwh hath heard the voice of my weeping.
Yhwh hath heard my supplication; Yhwh will receive my prayer.
Let all mine enemies be ashamed and sore vexed: let them return and be ashamed suddenly.

Yhwh reigneth, he is clothed with majesty; Yhwh is clothed with strength, wherewith he hath girded himself: the world also is stablished, that it cannot be moved.
Thy throne is established of old: thou art from everlasting.
The floods have lifted up, O Yhwh, the floods have lifted up their voice; the floods lift up their waves.
Yhwh on high is mightier than the noise of many waters, yea, than the mighty waves of the sea.
Thy testimonies are very sure: holiness becometh thine house, O Yhwh, for ever.

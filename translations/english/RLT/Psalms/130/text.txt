Out of the depths have I cried unto thee, O Yhwh.
Lord, hear my voice: let thine ears be attentive to the voice of my supplications.
If thou, Yah, shouldest mark iniquities, O Lord, who shall stand?
But there is forgiveness with thee, that thou mayest be feared.
I wait for Yhwh, my soul doth wait, and in his word do I hope.
My soul waiteth for the Lord more than they that watch for the morning: I say, more than they that watch for the morning.
Let Israel hope in Yhwh: for with Yhwh there is mercy, and with him is plenteous redemption.
And he shall redeem Israel from all his iniquities.

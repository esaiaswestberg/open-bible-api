I, a fellow elder and witness of the sufferings of the Christ, and a partaker of the glory going be revealed, exhort the elders among you:
Tend ye the flock of God among you, watching over, not by obligation, but willingly, nor greedily, but readily,
nor as domineering over the lots, but becoming examples of the flock.
And when the chief Shepherd is made known, ye will receive the unfading crown of glory.
Likewise younger men should be subordinate to the elder men. And all being subordinate to each other, clothe yourselves with humility, because God sets himself against the haughty, but gives grace to the lowly.
Therefore be lowered under the mighty hand of God, so that he may lift you up in time,
having cast all your concern upon him, because he cares for you.
Be sober, be vigilant. Your opponent the devil, as a roaring lion, walks about seeking whom to devour.
Whom resist, steadfast in the faith, knowing the same sufferings are to be accomplished in the world by your brotherhood.
And may the God of all grace who called you to his eternal glory in Christ Jesus (after suffering a little while) himself thoroughly prepare you. He will establish, strengthen, and provide a foundation.
To him is the glory and the dominion into the ages of the ages. Truly.
By Silvanus, the faithful brother to you, as I reckon, I wrote because of a few things, exhorting and testifying this to be the true grace of God in which ye stand.
She in Babylon, chosen together, salutes you, and my son Mark.
Salute each other by a kiss of love. Peace to you, to all those in Christ Jesus. Truly.

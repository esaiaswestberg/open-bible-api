Come, and let us return to Jehovah, for he has torn, and he will heal us. He has smitten, and he will bind us up.
After two days he will revive us. On the third day he will raise us up, and we shall live before him.
And let us know, let us follow on to know Jehovah. His going forth is sure as the morning, and he will come to us as the rain, as the latter rain that waters the earth.

Gilead is a city of those who work iniquity; it is stained with blood.
And as troops of robbers wait for a man, so the company of priests murder in the way toward Shechem. Yea, they have committed iniquity.
I have seen a horrible thing in the house of Israel. Whoredom is there in Ephraim; Israel is defiled.
Also, O Judah, there is a harvest appointed for thee when I bring back the captivity of my people.

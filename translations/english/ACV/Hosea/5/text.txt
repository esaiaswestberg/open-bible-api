Hear this, O ye priests, and hearken, O house of Israel, and give ear, O house of the king, for to you pertains the judgment. For ye have been a snare at Mizpah, and a net spread upon Tabor.
And the revolters have gone deep in making slaughter, but I am a rebuker of them all.
I know Ephraim, and Israel is not hid from me. For now, O Ephraim, thou have played the harlot; Israel is defiled.
Their doings will not allow them to turn to their God, for the spirit of whoredom is within them, and they do not know Jehovah.
And the pride of Israel testifies to his face. Therefore Israel and Ephraim shall stumble in their iniquity. Judah also shall stumble with them.
They shall go with their flocks and with their herds to seek Jehovah, but they shall not find him. He has withdrawn himself from them.
They have dealt treacherously against Jehovah, for they have borne strange sons. Now the new moon shall devour them with their fields.
Blow ye the cornet in Gibeah, and the trumpet in Ramah. Sound an alarm at Beth-aven, behind thee, O Benjamin.
Ephraim shall become a desolation in the day of rebuke. I have made known that which shall surely be among the tribes of Israel.
The rulers of Judah are like those who remove the landmark. I will pour out my wrath upon them like water.
Ephraim is oppressed. He is crushed in judgment, because he was content to walk after man's command.
Therefore I am to Ephraim as a moth, and to the house of Judah as rottenness.
When Ephraim saw his sickness, and Judah saw his wound, then Ephraim went to Assyria, and sent to king Jareb. But he is not able to heal you, nor will he cure you of your wound.
For I will be to Ephraim as a lion, and as a young lion to the house of Judah. I, even I, will tear and go away, I will carry off, and there shall be none to deliver.
I will go and return to my place, till they acknowledge their offense, and seek my face. In their affliction they will seek me earnestly.

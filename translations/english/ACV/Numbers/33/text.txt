And Aaron was a hundred and twenty-three years old when he died in mount Hor.

And Jehovah spoke to Moses in the plains of Moab by the Jordan at Jericho, saying,
Speak to the sons of Israel, and say to them, When ye pass over the Jordan into the land of Canaan,
then ye shall drive out all the inhabitants of the land from before you, and destroy all their figured stones, and destroy all their molten images, and demolish all their high places.
And ye shall take possession of the land, and dwell in it, for to you I have given the land to possess it.
And ye shall inherit the land by lot according to your families. To the more ye shall give more inheritance, and to the few thou shall give less inheritance. Wherever the lot falls to any man, that shall be his. Ye shall inherit according to the tribes of your fathers.
But if ye will not drive out the inhabitants of the land from before you, then those that ye let remain of them shall be as pricks in your eyes, and as thorns in your sides, and they shall vex you in the land in which ye dwell.
And it shall come to pass, that, as I thought to do to them, so I will do to you.

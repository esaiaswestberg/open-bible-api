And he showed me Joshua the high priest standing before the agent of Jehovah, and Satan standing at his right hand to be his adversary.
And Jehovah said to Satan, Jehovah rebuke thee, O Satan. Yea, Jehovah who has chosen Jerusalem rebuke thee. Is this not a brand plucked out of the fire?
Now Joshua was clothed with filthy garments, and was standing before the agent.
And he answered and spoke to those who stood before him, saying, Take the filthy garments from off him. And to him he said, Behold, I have caused thine iniquity to pass from thee, and I will clothe thee with rich apparel.
And I said, Let them set a clean miter upon his head. So they set a clean miter upon his head, and clothed him with garments. And the agent of Jehovah was standing by.
And the agent of Jehovah testified to Joshua, saying,
Thus says Jehovah of hosts: If thou will walk in my ways, and if thou will keep my charge, then thou also shall judge my house, and shall also keep my courts, and I will give thee a place of access among these who stand by.
Hear now, O Joshua the high priest, thou and thy fellows who sit before thee, for they are men who are a sign. For, behold, I will bring forth my servant the Branch.
For, behold, the stone that I have set before Joshua. Upon one stone are seven eyes. Behold, I will engrave the graving of it, says Jehovah of hosts, and I will remove the iniquity of that land in one day.
In that day, says Jehovah of hosts, ye shall invite each man his neighbor under the vine and under the fig tree.

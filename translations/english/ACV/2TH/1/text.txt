Paul and Silvanus and Timothy, to the congregation of Thessalonians in God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ:
Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
We are indebted to thank God always about you, brothers, as it is fitting, because your faith is increasing greatly, and the love of each one of you all toward each other abounds.
So as for us ourselves to have pride in you in the congregations of God, for your perseverance and faith in all your persecutions and in the tribulations that ye endure,
being evidence of the righteous judgment of God, for you to be considered worthy of the kingdom of God, for which also ye suffer.
Since it is a righteous thing according to God to repay restriction to those who restrict you,
and relief with us, to you who are restricted, at the revealing of the Lord Jesus from heaven with his agents of power
in a fire of flame rendering vengeance to those who have not known God, and to those not obeying the good news of our Lord Jesus Christ.
Men who will suffer punishment, a penalty of eternal destruction from the presence of the Lord and from the glory of his might,
when he comes to be glorified in his sanctified, and to be marveled in that day by all those who believe (because our testimony among you was believed).
For which also we pray always about you, so that our God will make you worthy of the calling, and will fulfill every desire of goodness and work of faith with power.
So that the name of our Lord Jesus Christ may be glorified in you and ye in him, according to the grace of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ.

And I saw another sign in heaven, great and marvelous: seven agents having seven plagues, the last, because in them the wrath of God is ended.
And I saw like a glassy sea mingled with fire, and those who were victorious over the beast and over its image and over the number of its name, standing on the glassy sea, having harps of God.
And they sing the song of Moses the bondman of God, and the song of the Lamb, saying, Great and marvelous are thy works, Lord God Almighty, righteous and true are thy ways, thou King of the nations.
Who will, no, not fear thee, O Lord, and glorify thy name, because thou alone are holy? Because all the nations will come and worship before thee, because thy righteous deeds were made known.
And after these things I looked, and the temple of the tabernacle of the testimony in heaven was opened.
And the seven agents came forth from the temple having the seven plagues, who were clothed in pure bright linen, and golden belts girded around their breasts.
And one of the four living creatures gave to the seven agents seven golden bowls containing the wrath of God who lives into the ages of the ages.
And the temple became full of vapor from the glory of God and from his power. And none was able to enter into the temple until the seven plagues of the seven agents were ended.

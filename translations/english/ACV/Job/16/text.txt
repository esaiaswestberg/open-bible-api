Then Job answered, and said,
I have heard many such things. Miserable comforters are ye all.
Shall vain words have an end? Or what provokes thee that thou answer?
I also could speak as ye do, if your soul were in my soul's stead. I could join words together against you, and shake my head at you.
But I would strengthen you with my mouth, and the solace of my lips would assuage your grief.
Though I speak, my grief is not assuaged, and though I forbear, what am I eased?
But now he has made me weary. Thou have made desolate all my company.
And thou have laid fast hold on me, which is a witness against me. And my leanness rises up against me; it testifies to my face.
He has torn me in his wrath, and persecuted me. He has gnashed upon me with his teeth. My adversary sharpens his eyes upon me.
They have gaped upon me with their mouth. They have smitten me upon the cheek reproachfully. They gather themselves together against me.
God delivers me to the perverse, and casts me into the hands of the wicked.
I was at ease, and he broke me apart. Yea, he has taken me by the neck, and dashed me to pieces. He has also set me up for his mark.
His archers encompass me round about. He splits my reins apart, and does not spare. He pours out my gall upon the ground.
He breaks me with breach upon breach. He runs upon me like a giant.
I have sewed sackcloth upon my skin, and have laid my horn in the dust.
My face is red with weeping, and the shadow of death is on my eyelids,
although there is no violence in my hands, and my prayer is pure.
O earth, do not cover thou my blood, and let my cry have no resting place.
Even now, behold, my witness is in heaven, and he who vouches for me is on high.
My friends scoff at me. My eye pours out tears to God
that he would maintain the right of a man with God, and of a son of man with his neighbor!
For when a few years are come, I shall go the way where I shall not return.

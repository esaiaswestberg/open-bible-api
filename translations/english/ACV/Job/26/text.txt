Then Job answered, and said,
How thou have helped him who is without power! How thou have saved the arm that has no strength!
How thou have counseled him who has no wisdom, and plentifully declared sound knowledge!
To whom have thou uttered words? And whose spirit came forth from thee?
Those who are deceased tremble beneath the waters and the inhabitants of it.
Sheol is naked before God, and Abaddon has no covering.
He stretches out the north over empty space, and hangs the earth upon nothing.
He binds up the waters in his thick clouds, and the cloud is not burst under them.
He encloses the face of his throne, and spreads his cloud upon it.
He has described a boundary upon the face of the waters, to the confines of light and darkness.
The pillars of heaven tremble and are astonished at his rebuke.
He stirs up the sea with his power, and by his understanding he smites through Rahab.
By his Spirit the heavens are garnished. His hand has pierced the swift serpent.
Lo, these are but the periphery of his ways. And how small a whisper do we hear of him! But the thunder of his power who can understand?

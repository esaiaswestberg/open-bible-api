And Moses went up from the plains of Moab to mount Nebo, to the top of Pisgah, that is opposite Jericho. And Jehovah showed him all the land of Gilead, to Dan,
and all Naphtali, and the land of Ephraim and Manasseh, and all the land of Judah, to the farther sea,
and the South, and the Plain of the valley of Jericho the city of palm trees, to Zoar.
And Jehovah said to him, This is the land which I swore to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, saying, I will give it to thy seed. I have caused thee to see it with thine eyes, but thou shall not go over there.
So Moses the servant of Jehovah died there in the land of Moab, according to the word of Jehovah.
And he buried him in the valley in the land of Moab opposite Beth-peor, but no man knows of his sepulcher to this day.
And Moses was a hundred and twenty years old when he died. His eye was not dim, nor his natural force abated.
And the sons of Israel wept for Moses in the plains of Moab thirty days. So the days of weeping and mourning for Moses were ended.
And Joshua the son of Nun was full of the spirit of wisdom, for Moses had laid his hands upon him. And the sons of Israel hearkened to him, and did as Jehovah commanded Moses.
And there has not arisen a prophet since in Israel like Moses, whom Jehovah knew face to face,
in all the signs and the wonders, which Jehovah sent him to do in the land of Egypt, to Pharaoh, and to all his servants, and to all his land,
and in all the mighty hand, and in all the great terror, which Moses wrought in the sight of all Israel.

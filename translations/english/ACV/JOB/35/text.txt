Moreover Elihu answered, and said,
What is this thou think in judgment? Who are thou that thou said, I am righteousness before the Lord?
That thou said, What advantage will it be to thee? And, What profit shall I have more than if I had sinned?
I will answer thee, and thy companions with thee.
Look to the heavens, and see. And behold the skies, which are higher than thou.
If thou have sinned, what do thou effect against him? And if thy transgressions be multiplied, what do thou to him?
If thou be righteous, what do thou give him? Or what does he receive of thy hand?
Thy wickedness is a man as thou are, and thy righteousness is a son of man.
Because of the multitude of oppressions they cry out. They cry for help because of the arm of the mighty.
But none says, Where is God my maker who gives songs in the night,
who teaches us more than the beasts of the earth, and makes us wiser than the birds of the heavens?
There they cry, but none gives answer, because of the pride of evil men.
Surely God will not hear an empty cry, nor will the Almighty regard it.
How much less when thou say thou do not behold him. The case is before him, and thou wait for him!
But now, because he has not visited in his anger, nor does he greatly regard folly,
so Job opens his mouth in vanity. He multiplies words without knowledge.

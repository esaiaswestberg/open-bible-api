Then Zophar the Naamathite answered, and said,
Should not the multitude of words be answered? And should a man full of talk be justified?
Should thy boastings make men hold their peace? And when thou mock, shall no man make thee ashamed?
For thou say, My doctrine is pure, and I am clean in thine eyes.
But O that God would speak, and open his lips against thee,
and that he would show thee the secrets of wisdom! For he is manifold in understanding. Know therefore that God exacts of thee less than thine iniquity deserves.
Can thou find out God by searching? Can thou find out the Almighty to perfection?
It is high as heaven; what can thou do? Deeper than Sheol; what can thou know?
The measure of it is longer than the earth, and broader than the sea.
If he passes through, and shuts up, and all to judgment, then who can hinder him?
For he knows false men. He also sees iniquity. Will he not then consider it?
But vain man is void of understanding. Yea, man is born as a wild donkey's colt.
If thou set thy heart aright, and stretch out thy hands toward him,
if iniquity is in thy hand, put it far away, and let not unrighteousness dwell in thy tents.
Surely then thou shall lift up thy face without spot. Yea, thou shall be steadfast, and shall not fear.
For thou shall forget thy misery. Thou shall remember it as waters that are passed away.
And thy life shall be clearer than the noonday. Though there be darkness, it shall be as the morning.
And thou shall be secure, because there is hope. Yea, thou shall search about thee, and shall take thy rest in safety.
Also thou shall lie down, and none shall make thee afraid. Yea, many shall correspond with thee.
But the eyes of the wicked shall fail, and they shall have no way to flee. And their hope shall be the giving up of the spirit.

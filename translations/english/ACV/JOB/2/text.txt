Again it came to pass on the day when the sons of God came to present themselves before Jehovah, that Satan came also among them to present himself before Jehovah.
And Jehovah said to Satan, From where did thou come? And Satan answered Jehovah, and said, From going to and fro on the earth, and from walking up and down on it.
And Jehovah said to Satan, Have thou considered my servant Job? For there is none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one who fears God, and turns away from evil. And he still holds fast his integrity, although thou moved me against him, to destroy him without cause.
And Satan answered Jehovah, and said, Skin for skin, yea, all that a man has he will give for his life.
But put forth thy hand now, and touch his bone and his flesh, and he will renounce thee to thy face.
And Jehovah said to Satan, Behold, he is in thy hand, only spare his life.
So Satan went forth from the presence of Jehovah, and smote Job with severe boils from the sole of his foot to his crown.
And he took a potsherd for him to scrape himself with it, and he sat among the ashes.
Then his wife said to him, Do thou still hold fast thine integrity? Renounce God, and die.
But he said to her, Thou speak as one of the foolish women speaks. What? Shall we receive good at the hand of God, and shall we not receive evil? In all this Job did not sin with his lips.
Now when Job's three friends heard of all this evil that came upon him, they came each one from his own place-Eliphaz the Temanite, and Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite-and they made an appointment together to come to bemoan him and to comfort him.
And when they lifted up their eyes afar off, and did not recognize him, they lifted up their voice, and wept. And each one tore his robe, and sprinkled dust upon their heads toward heaven.
So they sat down with him upon the ground seven days and seven nights. And none spoke a word to him, for they saw that his grief was very great.

And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,
Make thee two trumpets of silver, of beaten work thou shall make them. And thou shall use them for the calling of the congregation, and for the journeying of the camps.
And when they shall blow them, all the congregation shall gather themselves to thee at the door of the tent of meeting.
And if they blow but one, then the rulers, the heads of the thousands of Israel, shall gather themselves to thee.
And when ye blow an alarm, the camps that lie on the east side shall take their journey.
And when ye blow an alarm the second time, the camps that lie on the south side shall take their journey. They shall blow an alarm for their journeys.
But when the assembly is to be gathered together, ye shall blow, but ye shall not sound an alarm.
And the sons of Aaron, the priests, shall blow the trumpets, and they shall be to you for a statute forever throughout your generations.
And when ye go to war in your land against the adversary that oppresses you, then ye shall sound an alarm with the trumpets. And ye shall be remembered before Jehovah your God, and ye shall be saved from your enemies.
Also in the day of your gladness, and in your set feasts, and in the beginnings of your months, ye shall blow the trumpets over your burnt offerings, and over the sacrifices of your peace offerings. And they shall be to you for a memorial before your God: I am Jehovah your God.

And Moses said to Hobab, the son of Reuel the Midianite, Moses' father-in-law, We are journeying to the place of which Jehovah said, I will give it to you. Come thou with us, and we will do thee good, for Jehovah has spoken good concerning Israel.
And he said to him, I will not go, but I will depart to my own land, and to my kindred.
And he said, Leave us not, I pray thee, inasmuch as thou know how we are to encamp in the wilderness, and thou shall be to us instead of eyes.
And it shall be, if thou go with us, yea, it shall be, that whatever good Jehovah shall do to us, the same we will do to thee.
And they set forward from the mount of Jehovah three days' journey. And the ark of the covenant of Jehovah went before them three days' journey, to seek out a resting-place for them.
And the cloud of Jehovah was over them by day when they set forward from the camp.

And when it rested, he said, Return, O Jehovah, to the ten thousands of the thousands of Israel.

For indeed it is superfluous for me to write to you about the service for the sanctified.
For I know your willingness, which I boast about you to the Macedonians, that Achaia was prepared from a year ago. And your zeal provoked the majority.
But I sent the brothers so that our boast about you would not be empty in this regard. So that, as I said, ye may be prepared,
if somehow Macedonians should come with me and find you unprepared, we (that we might not say, ye) would be embarrassed in this confidence of boast.
Therefore I thought it necessary to exhort the brothers that they would go ahead to you, and arrange in advance your gift that was earlier announced, for this to be ready this way as a gift and not as an exaction.
But this, he who sows sparingly will also reap sparingly, and he who sows in blessings will also reap in blessings.
Each man as he purposes in his heart, not from regret or from necessity, for God loves a cheerful giver.
And God is able to abound all grace for you, so that always in everything having all sufficiency, ye may abound for every good work,
as it is written, He has scattered abroad. He has given to the poor. His righteousness endures into the age.
And he who supplies seed to the man who sows, and bread for eating, may he supply and multiply your seed, and may he increase the fruits of your righteousness,
being enriched in everything for every generosity, which works gratitude to God through us.
Because the service of this ministry is not only supplying the needs of the sanctified, but also abounding through many thanksgivings to God
through the evidence of this service, glorifying God at the subjection of your confession toward the good news of the Christ, and at the generosity of the participation, for them and for all,
and by their supplication about you, yearning for you because of the transcending grace of God in you.
And thanks to God for his indescribable gift.

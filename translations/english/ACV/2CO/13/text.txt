This third time I am coming to you. In the mouth of two witnesses or three every saying will be confirmed.
I have told you before, and I say in advance, as present the second time, and now absent, I write to those who have previously sinned, and to all the others, that if I come to it again, I will not spare,
since ye seek proof of the Christ speaking in me, who is not weak toward you, but is mighty in you.
For even if he was crucified from weakness, yet he lives from the power of God. For we in him are also weak, but we will live with him from the power of God toward you.
Examine yourselves whether ye are in the faith. Test yourselves. Or know ye not yourselves, that Jesus Christ is in you? Unless ye are test-failing something.
But I hope that ye will know that we are not test-failing.
Now I pray to God, to do you nothing harmful, not that we would appear test-passing, but that ye would do right, even like we might be test-failing.
For we do not have any power against the truth, but for the truth.
For we are glad when we are weak and ye are strong. And this also we pray for, your full qualification.
Because of this I write these things while absent, so that I may not act harshly when present, according to the authority that the Lord gave me for building up and not for tearing down.
Finally brothers, farewell. Be thoroughly prepared, be encouraged, think the same way, live in peace, and the God of love and peace will be with you.
Salute each other by a holy kiss.
All the sanctified salute you.
The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit, is with all of you. Truly.

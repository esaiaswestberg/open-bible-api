And the agent who talked with me came again, and awoke me, as a man who is awakened out of his sleep.
And he said to me, What do thou see? And I said, I have seen, and, behold, a lampstand all of gold, with its bowl upon the top of it, and its seven lamps on it. There are seven pipes to each of the lamps, which are upon the top of it,
and two olive trees by it, one upon the right side of the bowl, and the other upon the left side of it.
And I answered and spoke to the agent who talked with me, saying, What are these, my lord?
Then the agent who talked with me answered and said to me, Do thou not know what these are? And I said, No, my lord.
Then he answered and spoke to me, saying, This is the word of Jehovah to Zerubbabel, saying, Not by might, nor by power, but by my Spirit, says Jehovah of hosts.
Who are thou, O great mountain? Before Zerubbabel thou shall become a plain, and he shall bring forth the top stone with shoutings of Grace, grace, to it.
Moreover the word of Jehovah came to me, saying,
The hands of Zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this house. His hands shall also finish it. And thou shall know that Jehovah of hosts has sent me to you.
For who has despised the day of small things? For these seven shall rejoice, and shall see the plummet in the hand of Zerubbabel, the eyes of Jehovah, which run to and fro through the whole earth.
Then I answered, and said to him, What are these two olive trees upon the right side of the lampstand and upon the left side of it?
And I answered the second time, and said to him, What are these two olive-branches, which are beside the two golden spouts that empty the golden oil out of themselves?
And he answered me and said, Do thou not know what these are? And I said, No, my lord.
Then he said, These are the two anointed ones, who stand by the Lord of the whole earth.

Wisdom has built her house. She has hewn out her seven pillars.
She has killed her beasts. She has mingled her wine. She has also furnished her table.
She has sent forth her maidens. She cries out upon the highest places of the city:
He who is simple, let him turn in here. As for him who is void of understanding, she says to him,
Come, eat ye of my bread, and drink of the wine which I have mingled.
Forsake ye simpleness, and live, and walk in the way of understanding.
He who corrects a scoffer gets himself reviling. And he who reproves a wicked man gets himself a bruise.
Reprove not a scoffer, lest he hate thee. Reprove a wise man, and he will love thee.
Give opportunity to a wise man, and he will be yet wiser. Teach a righteous man, and he will increase in learning.
The fear of Jehovah is the beginning of wisdom, and the knowledge of the Holy is understanding.
For by me thy days shall be multiplied, and the years of thy life shall be increased.
If thou are wise, thou are wise for thyself. And if thou scoff, thou alone shall bear it.
The foolish woman is clamorous, simple, and knows nothing.
And she sits at the door of her house, on a seat in the high places of the city,
to call to those who pass by, who go right on their ways:
He who is simple, let him turn in here. And as for him who is void of understanding, she says to him,
Stolen waters are sweet, and bread in secret is pleasant.
But he knows not that the dead are there, that her guests are in the depths of Sheol.

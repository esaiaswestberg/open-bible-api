If I speak with the tongues of men and of agents, but have not love, I have become sounding brass, or a clashing cymbal.
And if I have prophecy, and know all mysteries and all knowledge, and if I have all faith so as to remove mountains, and have not love, I am nothing.
And if I dole out all things possessed by me, and if I deliver my body so that I may be burned, and have not love, I benefit nothing.
Love is patient and is kind. Love does not envy. Love does not brag, and is not puffed up.
It does not behave improperly, does not seek the things of itself, is not made sharp, does not contemplate evil,
does not rejoice in wrong but rejoices in the truth,
covers all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things.
Love never fails. But whether prophecies, they will be abolished, whether tongues, they will cease, whether knowledge, it will be abolished.
But we know in part, and we prophesy in part,
but when the perfect comes, then what is in part will be abolished.
When I was a child, I spoke as a child, I understood as a child, I reasoned as a child, but when I became a man, I abolished the childish things.
For now we see by polished metal, in dimness, but then face to face. Now I know in part, but then I will know just as also I was known.
And now remain faith, hope, love, these three, but the greater of these is love.

Now about the things sacrificed to idols. We know that all have knowledge. Knowledge puffs up, but love builds up.
If any man presumes to know anything, he knows nothing yet as he ought to know.
But if any man loves God, this man is known by him.
Therefore about eating the things sacrificed to idols, we know that an idol is nothing in the world, and that there is no other God except one.
For also since there are things called gods, whether in heaven or on the earth, as there are many gods and many lords,
yet to us there is one God, the Father, from whom are all things, and we for him, and one Lord, Jesus Christ, through whom are all things, and we through him.
Nevertheless the knowledge is not in all men, but some, with conscience of the idol until now, eat as sacrificed to idols, and their weak conscience is defiled.
But food does not present us to God, for neither if we eat are we ahead, nor if we do not eat are we behind.
But take heed lest somehow this privilege of yours becomes a stumbling-block to those who are weak.
For if some man sees thee, who has knowledge, dining in an idol-temple, will not his conscience, being weak, be strengthened to eat things sacrificed to idols?
And by thy knowledge the brother, being weak, will be ruined, for whom Christ died.
And sinning this way against the brothers, and wounding their weak conscience, ye sin against Christ.
Therefore if food causes my brother to stumble, I will no, not eat meat into the age, so that I may not cause my brother to stumble.

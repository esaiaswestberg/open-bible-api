And I, brothers, when I came to you, came not in eminence of speech or of wisdom proclaiming the testimony of God to you.
For I determined not to know anything among you except Jesus Christ, even this crucified man.
And I was with you in weakness, and in fear, and in much trembling.
And my speech and my preaching were not in persuasive words of human wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power,
so that your faith would not be in wisdom of men, but in the power of God.
But we speak wisdom among the fully developed, but not a wisdom of this age, nor of the rulers of this age who come to nothing.
But we speak a wisdom of God in a hidden mystery, which God predestined before the ages for our glory,
which none of the rulers of this age have known. For if they had known, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory.
But as it is written, What an eye has not seen, and an ear has not heard, and have not arisen in a heart of a man, are things that God prepared for those who love him.
But God disclosed it to us through his Spirit, for the Spirit searches all things, even the deep things of God.
For what man knows the things of the man, except the spirit of the man in him? And so nobody knows the things of God except the Spirit of God.
But we did not receive the spirit of the world, but the Spirit from God, so that we might know the things graciously given to us by God.
Which things also we speak, not in things learned from mankind, in words of wisdom, but in things learned from the Holy Spirit, comparing spiritual things with spiritual things.
Now the natural man does not accept the things of the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness to him, and he is unable to understand because they are evaluated spiritually.
But truly the spiritual man evaluates all things, but he himself is evaluated by none.
For who has known the mind of the Lord that he will stand with him? But we have the mind of Christ.

And when the queen of Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon, she came to test Solomon with hard questions at Jerusalem, with a very great caravan, and camels that bore spices, and gold in abundance, and precious stones. And when she came to Solomon, she conversed with him of all that was in her heart.
And Solomon answered to her all her questions. And there was not anything hid from Solomon that he did not answer her.
And when the queen of Sheba had seen the wisdom of Solomon, and the house that he had built,
and the food of his table, and the seating of his servants, and the attendance of his ministers, and their apparel, also his cupbearers, and their apparel, and his ascent by which he went up to the house of Jehovah, there was no more spirit in her.
And she said to the king, It was a true report that I heard in my own land of thine acts, and of thy wisdom.
However I did not believe their words until I came, and my eyes had seen it. And, behold, the half of the greatness of thy wisdom was not told me. Thou exceed the fame that I heard.
Happy are thy men, and happy are these thy servants, who stand continually before thee, and hear thy wisdom.
Blessed be Jehovah thy God, who delighted in thee, to set thee on his throne to be king for Jehovah thy God. Because thy God loved Israel, to establish them forever, therefore he made thee king over them, to do justice and righteousness.
And she gave the king a hundred and twenty talents of gold, and spices in great abundance, and precious stones. Neither was there any such spice as the queen of Sheba gave to king Solomon.
And also the servants of Huram, and the servants of Solomon, who brought gold from Ophir, brought algum trees and precious stones.
And the king made of the algum trees terraces for the house of Jehovah, and for the king's house, and harps and psalteries for the singers. And there were none such seen before in the land of Judah.
And king Solomon gave to the queen of Sheba all her desire, whatever she asked, besides that which she had brought to the king. So she turned, and went to her own land, she and her servants.
Now the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was six hundred and sixty-six talents of gold,
besides that which the traders and merchants brought. And all the kings of Arabia and the governors of the country brought gold and silver to Solomon.
And king Solomon made two hundred bucklers of beaten gold; six hundred shekels of beaten gold went to one buckler.
And he made three hundred shields of beaten gold; three hundred shekels of gold went to one shield. And the king put them in the house of the forest of Lebanon.
Moreover the king made a great throne of ivory, and overlaid it with pure gold.
And there were six steps to the throne, with a footstool of gold, which were fastened to the throne, and supports on either side by the place of the seat, and two lions standing beside the supports.
And twelve lions stood there on the one side and on the other upon the six steps. There was not the like made in any kingdom.
And all king Solomon's drinking vessels were of gold, and all the vessels of the house of the forest of Lebanon were of pure gold; silver was accounted of nothing in the days of Solomon.
For the king had ships that went to Tarshish with the servants of Huram. Once every three years the ships of Tarshish came, bringing gold, and silver, ivory, and apes, and peacocks.
So king Solomon exceeded all the kings of the earth in riches and wisdom.
And all the kings of the earth sought the presence of Solomon, to hear his wisdom, which God had put in his heart.
And they brought every man his tribute, vessels of silver, and vessels of gold, and raiment, armor, and spices, horses, and mules, a rate year by year.
And Solomon had four thousand stalls for horses and chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen, that he bestowed in the chariot cities, and with the king at Jerusalem.
And he ruled over all the kings from the River even to the land of the Philistines, and to the border of Egypt.
And the king made silver to be in Jerusalem as stones, and he made cedars to be as the sycamore trees that are in the lowland, for abundance.
And they brought horses for Solomon out of Egypt, and out of all lands.
Now the rest of the acts of Solomon, first and last, are they not written in the history of Nathan the prophet, and in the prophecy of Ahijah the Shilonite, and in the visions of Iddo the seer concerning Jeroboam the son of Nebat?
And Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel forty years.
And Solomon slept with his fathers, and he was buried in the city of David his father. And Rehoboam his son reigned in his stead.

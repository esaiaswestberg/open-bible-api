Bel bows down, Nebo stoops, their idols are upon the beasts, and upon the cattle. The things that ye carried about are made a load, a burden to the weary beast.
They stoop, they bow down together. They could not deliver the burden, but themselves are gone into captivity.
Hearken to me, O house of Jacob, and all the remnant of the house of Israel, who have been borne by me from their birth, who have been carried from the womb.
And even to old age I am he, and even to hoar hairs I will carry you. I have made, and I will bear, yea, I will carry, and will deliver.
To whom will ye liken me, and make me equal, and compare me, that we may be alike?
Such as lavish gold out of the bag, and weigh silver in the balance, they hire a goldsmith, and he makes it a god. They fall down, yea, they worship.
They bear it upon the shoulder. They carry it, and set it in its place, and it stands. From its place it shall not remove. Yea, he may cry to it, yet it cannot answer, nor save him out of his trouble.
Remember this, and show yourselves men. Bring it again to mind, O ye transgressors.
Remember the former things of old, for I am God, and there is none else. I am God, and there is none like me,
declaring the end from the beginning, and from ancient times things that are not yet done, saying, My counsel shall stand, and I will do all my pleasure,
calling a ravenous bird from the east, the man of my counsel from a far country. Yea, I have spoken. I will also bring it to pass. I have purposed. I will also do it.
Hearken to me, ye stout-hearted, who are far from righteousness:
I bring near my righteousness. It shall not be far off. And my salvation shall not tarry, and I will place salvation in Zion for Israel my glory.

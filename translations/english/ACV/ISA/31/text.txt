Woe to those who go down to Egypt for help, and rely on horses, and trust in chariots because they are many, and in horsemen because they are very strong, but they look not to the Holy One of Israel, nor seek Jehovah!
Yet he also is wise, and will bring evil, and will not call back his words, but will arise against the house of the evildoers, and against the help of those who work iniquity.
Now the Egyptians are men, and not God, and their horses flesh, and not spirit. And when Jehovah shall stretch out his hand, both he who helps shall stumble, and he who is helped shall fall, and they shall all be consumed together.
For thus says Jehovah to me, As the lion and the young lion growling over his prey, even if a multitude of shepherds are called forth against him, he will not be dismayed at their voice, nor abase himself for the noise of them, so Jehovah of hosts will come down to fight upon mount Zion, and upon the hill of it.
As birds hovering, so Jehovah of hosts will protect Jerusalem. He will protect and deliver. He will pass over and preserve.
Turn ye to him from whom ye have deeply revolted, O sons of Israel.
For in that day they shall cast away every man his idols of silver, and his idols of gold, which your own hands have made to you for a sin.
And the Assyrian shall fall by the sword, not of man, and the sword, not of men, shall devour him. But he shall flee from the sword, and his young men shall become subject to task work.
And his rock shall pass away because of terror, and his rulers shall be dismayed at the ensign, says Jehovah, whose fire is in Zion, and his furnace in Jerusalem.

The wilderness and the dry land shall be glad. And the desert shall rejoice, and blossom as the rose.
It shall blossom abundantly, and rejoice even with joy and singing. The glory of Lebanon shall be given to it, the excellency of Carmel and Sharon. They shall see the glory of Jehovah, the excellency of our God.
Strengthen ye the weak hands, and confirm the feeble knees.
Say to those who are of a fearful heart, Be strong, fear not. Behold, your God will come with vengeance, with the recompense of God. He will come and save you.
Then the eyes of the blind shall be opened, and the ears of the deaf shall be unstopped.
Then the lame man shall leap as a hart, and the tongue of the mute shall sing. For waters in the wilderness shall break out, and streams in the desert.
And the glowing sand shall become a pool, and the thirsty ground springs of water. In the habitation of jackals, where they lay, shall be grass with reeds and rushes.
And a highway shall be there, and a way. And it shall be called The way of holiness. The unclean shall not pass over it, but it shall be for the redeemed, the wayfaring men. Yea fools shall not err in it.
No lion shall be there, nor shall any ravenous beast go up in it. They shall not be found there, but the redeemed shall walk there.
And the ransomed of Jehovah shall return, and come with singing to Zion. And everlasting joy shall be upon their heads. They shall obtain gladness and joy. And sorrow and sighing shall flee away.

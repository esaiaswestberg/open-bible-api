And it came to pass after the death of Joshua, that the sons of Israel asked of Jehovah, saying, Who shall go up for us first against the Canaanites, to fight against them?
And Jehovah said, Judah shall go up. Behold, I have delivered the land into his hand.
And Judah said to Simeon his brother, Come up with me into my lot, that we may fight against the Canaanites, and I likewise will go with thee into thy lot. So Simeon went with him.
And Judah went up, and Jehovah delivered the Canaanites and the Perizzites into their hand, and they smote of them in Bezek ten thousand men.
And they found Adoni-bezek in Bezek, and they fought against him, and they smote the Canaanites and the Perizzites.
But Adoni-bezek fled, and they pursued after him, and caught him, and cut off his thumbs and his great toes.
And Adoni-bezek said, Seventy kings, having their thumbs and their great toes cut off, gathered scraps under my table. As I have done, so God has requited me. And they brought him to Jerusalem, and he died there.
And the sons of Judah fought against Jerusalem, and took it, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and set the city on fire.

And Judah went against the Canaanites who dwelt in Hebron (now the name of Hebron was formerly Kiriath-arba), and they smote Sheshai, and Ahiman, and Talmai.

And Caleb said, He who smites Kiriath-sepher, and takes it, I will give to him Achsah my daughter to wife.
And Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb's younger brother, took it, and he gave him Achsah his daughter to wife.
And it came to pass, when she came to him, that she moved him to ask of her father a field. And she alighted from off her donkey, and Caleb said to her, What would thou?
And she said to him, Give me a blessing, since thou have set me in the land of the South, give me also springs of water. And Caleb gave her the upper springs and the nether springs.
And the sons of the Kenite, Moses' brother-in-law, went up out of the city of palm trees with the sons of Judah into the wilderness of Judah, which is in the south of Arad, and they went and dwelt with the people.
And Judah went with Simeon his brother, and they smote the Canaanites that inhabited Zephath, and utterly destroyed it. And the name of the city was called Hormah.
Also Judah took Gaza with the border of it, and Ashkelon with the border of it, and Ekron with the border of it.
And Jehovah was with Judah, and drove out those of the hill-country. But they could not drive out the inhabitants of the valley because they had chariots of iron.
And they gave Hebron to Caleb, as Moses had spoken, and he drove out the three sons of Anak from there.
And the sons of Benjamin did not drive out the Jebusites who inhabited Jerusalem, but the Jebusites dwell with the sons of Benjamin in Jerusalem to this day.
And the house of Joseph, they also went up against Bethel, and Jehovah was with them.
And the house of Joseph sent to spy out Bethel. (Now the name of the city was formerly Luz.)
And the spies saw a man come forth out of the city, and they said to him, Show us, we pray thee, the entrance into the city, and we will deal kindly with thee.
And he showed them the entrance into the city. And they smote the city with the edge of the sword, but they let the man go and all his family.
And the man went into the land of the Hittites, and built a city, and called the name of it Luz, which is the name of it to this day.
And Manasseh did not drive out those of Beth-shean and its towns, nor of Taanach and its towns, nor the inhabitants of Dor and its towns, nor the inhabitants of Ibleam and its towns, nor the inhabitants of Megiddo and its towns, but the Canaanites would dwell in that land.
And it came to pass, when Israel grew strong, that they put the Canaanites to task work, and did not utterly drive them out.

Asher did not drive out the inhabitants of Acco, nor the inhabitants of Sidon, nor of Ahlab, nor of Achzib, nor of Helbah, nor of Aphik, nor of Rehob,
but the Asherites dwelt among the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land, for they did not drive them out.
Naphtali did not drive out the inhabitants of Beth-shemesh, nor the inhabitants of Beth-anath, but he dwelt among the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land. Nevertheless the inhabitants of Beth-shemesh and of Beth-anath became subject to task work.
And the Amorites forced the sons of Dan into the hill-country, for they would not allow them to come down to the valley,
but the Amorites would dwell in mount Heres, in Aijalon, and in Shaalbim. Yet the hand of the house of Joseph prevailed, so that they became subject to task work.
And the border of the Amorites was from the ascent of Akrabbim, from the rock, and upward.

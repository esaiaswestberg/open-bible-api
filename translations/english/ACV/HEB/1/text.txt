God, who formerly spoke in many portions and in many ways to the fathers by the prophets, spoke to us in these last days by a Son,
whom he appointed heir of all things, through whom also he made the ages.
Who, being the radiance of his glory, and the exact image of his essence, and upholding all things by the word of his power, having made purification of our sins through himself, he sat down at the right hand of the Majesty in the heights.
Having become so much better than the agents, as he has inherited a more excellent name than they.
For to which of the agents did he ever say, Thou are my Son, today I have begotten thee? And again, I will be to him for a Father, and he will be to me for a Son?
And again when he brings the firstborn into the world he says, And let all the agents of God worship him.
And indeed toward the agents he says, He who makes his agents spirits, and his ministers a flame of fire.
But toward the Son, Thy throne, O God, is into the age of the age. The scepter of thy kingdom is a scepter of straightness.
Thou have loved righteousness and hated lawlessness. Because of this, God, thy God, anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy companions.
And thou, Lord, at the beginnings founded the earth, and the heavens are the works of thy hands.
They will perish, but thou are permanent. And they will all become old as a garment.
And thou will roll them up as a mantle, and they will be changed. But thou are the same, and thy years will not cease.
But to which of the agents has he ever said, Sit thou by my right hand until I place thine enemies a footstool of thy feet?
Are they not all ministering spirits sent forth for service for the sake of those who are going to inherit salvation?

Fornication is actually heard among you, and such fornication that is not even named among the Gentiles, for some man to have his father's wife.
And ye are puffed up and did not rather mourn, so that he who committed this deed might be taken away from the midst of you.
For I truly, as being absent in the body but present in the spirit, I have already, as though present, judged the man who committed this thing this way.
In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, when ye are gathered together, and my spirit with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ,
to deliver such a man to Satan for destruction of the flesh, so that the spirit might be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus.
Your boasting is not good. Know ye not that a little leaven leavens the whole lump?
Purge out the old leaven, so that ye may be a new lump, since ye are unleavened. For also Christ our Passover was sacrificed for us.
Therefore we should feast, not by old leaven, nor by leaven of evil and wickedness, but by non-leaven of sincerity and truth.
I wrote to you in the letter not to associate with fornicators,
and not at all with the fornicators of this world, or with greedy men, or with predators, or with idolaters, since then ye would need to go out of the world.
But now I write to you not to associate if any man who is called a brother is a fornicator, or a greedy man, or an idolater, or a slanderer, or a drunkard, or a predator, not even to eat with such kind.
For what is in me to also judge those outside? Do ye not judge those inside?
But God judges those outside. And ye yourselves shall drive out the evil man from you.

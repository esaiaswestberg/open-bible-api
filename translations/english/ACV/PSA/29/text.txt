Ascribe to Jehovah, O ye sons of the mighty, ascribe to Jehovah glory and strength.
Ascribe to Jehovah the glory due to his name. Worship Jehovah in holy array.
The voice of Jehovah is upon the waters. The God of glory thunders, even Jehovah upon many waters.
The voice of Jehovah is powerful. The voice of Jehovah is full of majesty.
The voice of Jehovah breaks the cedars. Yea, Jehovah breaks in pieces the cedars of Lebanon.
He makes them also to skip like a calf, Lebanon and Sirion like a young wild-ox.
The voice of Jehovah splits the flames of fire.
The voice of Jehovah shakes the wilderness. Jehovah shakes the wilderness of Kadesh.
The voice of Jehovah makes the hinds to calve, and strips the forests bare. And in his temple everything says, Glory.
Jehovah sat as King at the Flood. Yea, Jehovah sits as King forever.
Jehovah will give strength to his people. Jehovah will bless his people with peace.

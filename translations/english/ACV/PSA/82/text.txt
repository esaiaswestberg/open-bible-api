God stands in the congregation of God. He judges among the gods.
How long will ye judge unjustly, and respect the persons of the wicked? Selah.
Judge the poor man and the orphan. Do justice to the afflicted and destitute man.
Rescue the poor and needy man. Deliver from the hand of the wicked man.
They know not, nor do they understand. They walk to and fro in darkness. All the foundations of the earth are shaken.
I said, Ye are gods, and all of you sons of the Most High.
Nevertheless ye shall die like men, and fall like one of the rulers.
Arise, O God, judge the earth, for thou shall inherit all the nations.

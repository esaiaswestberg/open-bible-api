Why do the nations rage, and the peoples meditate vain things?
The kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers take counsel together, against Jehovah, and against his anointed, saying,
Let us break their bonds apart, and cast away their cords from us.
He who sits in the heavens will laugh. The Lord will have them in derision.
Then he will speak to them in his wrath, and vex them in his great displeasure.
Yet I have set my king upon my holy hill of Zion.
I will tell of the decree. Jehovah said to me, Thou are my Son, this day I have begotten thee.
Ask of me, and I will give thee the nations for thine inheritance, and the outermost parts of the earth for thy possession.
Thou shall break them with a rod of iron, thou shall dash them in pieces like a potter's vessel.
Now therefore be wise, O ye kings. Be instructed, ye judges of the earth.
Serve Jehovah with fear, and rejoice with trembling.
Kiss the Son, lest he be angry, and ye perish in the way, for his wrath will soon be kindled. Blessed are all those who take refuge in him.

I will give thee thanks with my whole heart. I will sing praises to thee before the gods.
I will worship toward thy holy temple, and give thanks to thy name for thy loving kindness and for thy truth. For thou have magnified thy word above all thy name.
Thou answered me in the day that I called. Thou encouraged me with strength in my soul.
All the kings of the earth shall give thee thanks, O Jehovah, for they have heard the words of thy mouth.
Yea, they shall sing of the ways of Jehovah, for great is the glory of Jehovah.
For though Jehovah is high, yet he has respect to the lowly. But he knows the haughty from afar.
Though I walk in the midst of trouble, thou will revive me. Thou will stretch forth thy hand against the wrath of my enemies, and thy right hand will save me.
Jehovah will perfect that which concerns me. Thy loving kindness, O Jehovah, is forever. Forsake not the works of thine own hands.

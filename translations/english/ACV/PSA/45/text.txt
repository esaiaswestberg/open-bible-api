My heart overflows with a good matter. I speak the things which I have made concerning the king. My tongue is the pen of a ready writer.
Thou are fairer than the sons of men. Grace is poured into thy lips. Therefore God has blessed thee forever.
Gird thy sword upon thy thigh, O mighty one, thy glory and thy majesty.
And in thy majesty ride on prosperously because of truth and gentleness and righteousness. And thy right hand shall teach thee awesome things.
Thine arrows are sharp. The peoples fall under thee. They are in the heart of the king's enemies.
Thy throne, O God, is forever and ever. A scepter of straightness is the scepter of thy kingdom.
Thou have loved righteousness, and hated wickedness. Therefore God, thy God, has anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy companions.
All thy garments smell of myrrh, and aloes, and cassia. Out of ivory palaces stringed instruments have made thee glad.
Kings' daughters are among thy honorable women. At thy right hand stands the queen in gold of Ophir.
Hearken, O daughter, and consider, and incline thine ear. Forget also thine own people, and thy father's house.
So will the king desire thy beauty, for he is thy lord, and reverence thou him.
And the daughter of Tyre shall adore him with a gift. The rich among the people shall entreat thy favor.
Inside, the king's daughter is all glorious. Her clothing is embroidered with gold.
She shall be led to the king in broidered work. The virgins, her companions who follow her, shall be brought to thee.
With gladness and rejoicing they shall be led. They shall enter into the king's palace.
Instead of thy fathers shall be thy sons, whom thou shall make rulers in all the earth.
I will make thy name to be remembered in all generations. Therefore the peoples shall give thee thanks forever and ever.

To thee, O Jehovah, I will call. My rock, be not thou deaf to me, lest, if thou be silent to me, I become like those who go down into the pit.
Hear the voice of my supplications when I cry to thee, when I lift up my hands toward thy holy oracle.
Draw me not away with the wicked, and with the workers of iniquity, who speak peace with their neighbors, but mischief is in their hearts.
Give them according to their work, and according to the wickedness of their doings. Give them after the operation of their hands. Render to them their recompense,
because they regard not the works of Jehovah, nor the operation of his hands. He will break them down and not build them up.
Blessed be Jehovah, because he has heard the voice of my supplications.
Jehovah is my strength and my shield. My heart has trusted in him, and I am helped. Therefore my heart greatly rejoices, and with my song I will praise him.
Jehovah is their strength, and he is a stronghold of salvation to his anointed.
Save thy people, and bless thine inheritance. Be their shepherd also, and bear them up forever.

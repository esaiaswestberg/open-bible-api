Jehovah, my heart is not haughty, nor my eyes lofty. Neither do I exercise myself in grand matters, or in things too wonderful for me.
Surely I have stilled and quieted my soul like a weaned child with his mother. Like a weaned child is my soul within me.
O Israel, hope in Jehovah from this time forth and for evermore.

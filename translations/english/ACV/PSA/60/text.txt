O God thou have cast us off. Thou have broken us down. Thou have been angry. O restore us again.
Thou have made the land to tremble. Thou have torn it. Heal the breaking of it, for it shakes.
Thou have shown thy people hard things. Thou have made us to drink the wine of staggering.
Thou have given a banner to those who fear thee, that it may be displayed because of the truth. Selah.
That thy beloved ones may be delivered, save with thy right hand, and answer us.
God has spoken in his holiness. I will exult. I will divide Shechem, and mete out the valley of Succoth.
Gilead is mine, and Manasseh is mine. Ephraim also is the defense of my head. Judah is my scepter.
Moab is my wash pot. Upon Edom I will cast my shoe. Philistia, shout thou because of me.
Who will bring me into the strong city? Who has led me to Edom?
Have not thou, O God, cast us off? And thou go not forth, O God, with our armies.
Give us help against the adversary, for vain is the help of man.
Through God we shall do valiantly, for he it is who will tread down our adversaries.

Jehovah reigns! Let the peoples tremble. He sits above the cherubim, let the earth be moved.
Jehovah is great in Zion, and he is high above all the peoples.
Let them praise thy great and awesome name. Holy is he.
The king's strength also loves justice. Thou establish equity. Thou execute justice and righteousness in Jacob.
Exalt ye Jehovah our God, and worship at his footstool. Holy is he.
Moses and Aaron among his priests, and Samuel among those who call upon his name, they called upon Jehovah, and he answered them.
He spoke to them in the pillar of cloud. They kept his testimonies, and the statute that he gave them.
Thou answered them, O Jehovah our God. Thou were a God who forgave them, though thou took vengeance on their doings.
Exalt ye Jehovah our God, and worship at his holy hill. For Jehovah our God is holy.

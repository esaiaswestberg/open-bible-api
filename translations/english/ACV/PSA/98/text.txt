O sing to Jehovah a new song, for he has done marvelous things. His right hand, and his holy arm, has wrought salvation for him.
Jehovah has made known his salvation. He has openly shown his righteousness in the sight of the nations.
He has remembered his loving kindness and his faithfulness toward the house of Israel. All the ends of the earth have seen the salvation of our God.
Make a joyful noise to Jehovah, all the earth. Break forth and sing for joy, yea, sing praises.
Sing praises to Jehovah with the harp. With the harp and the voice of melody,
with trumpets and sound of cornet, make a joyful noise before the King-Jehovah.
Let the sea roar, and the fullness thereof, the world, and those who dwell in it.
Let the floods clap their hands. Let the hills sing for joy together
before Jehovah, for he comes to judge the earth. He will judge the world with righteousness, and the peoples with equity.

I was glad when they said to me, Let us go to the house of Jehovah.
Our feet are standing inside thy gates, O Jerusalem.
Jerusalem, that is built as a city that is compact together,
where the tribes go up, even the tribes of Jehovah, for an ordinance for Israel, to give thanks to the name of Jehovah.
For there thrones are set for judgment, the thrones of the house of David.
Pray for the peace of Jerusalem. They shall prosper who love thee.
Peace be within thy walls, and prosperity within thy palaces.
For my brothers and companions' sakes I will now say, Peace be within thee.
For the sake of the house of Jehovah our God I will seek thy good.

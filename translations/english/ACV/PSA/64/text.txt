Hear my voice, O God, in my complaint. Preserve my life from fear of the enemy.
Hide me from the secret counsel of evildoers, from the tumult of the workers of iniquity,
who have whet their tongue like a sword, and have aimed their arrows, even bitter words,
that they may shoot in secret places at a blameless man. Suddenly do they shoot at him, and fear not.
They encourage themselves in an evil purpose. They converse of laying snares secretly. They say, Who will see them?
They search out iniquities, saying, We have accomplished a diligent search. And the inward part of man and the heart are deep.
But God will shoot at them. With an arrow they shall suddenly be wounded.
So they shall be made to stumble, their own tongue being against them. All who see them shall wag the head.
And all men shall fear. And they shall declare the work of God, and shall wisely consider of his doing.
A righteous man shall be glad in Jehovah, and shall take refuge in him. And all the upright in heart shall glory.

I love Jehovah because he hears my voice and my supplications.
Because he has inclined his ear to me, therefore I will call as long as I live.
The cords of death encompassed me, and the pains of Sheol got hold upon me. I found trouble and sorrow.
Then I called upon the name of Jehovah. O Jehovah, I beseech thee, deliver my soul.
Gracious is Jehovah, and righteous. Yea, our God is merciful.
Jehovah preserves the simple. I was brought low, and he saved me.
Return to thy rest, O my soul, for Jehovah has dealt bountifully with thee.
For thou have delivered my soul from death, my eyes from tears, my feet from falling.
I will walk before Jehovah in the land of the living.
I believed, therefore I have spoken, but I was greatly afflicted.
I said in my haste, All men are liars.
What shall I render to Jehovah for all his benefits toward me?
I will take the cup of salvation, and call upon the name of Jehovah.
I will pay my vows to Jehovah, yea, in the presence of all his people.
Precious in the sight of Jehovah is the death of his sanctified.
O Jehovah, truly I am thy servant. I am thy servant, the son of thy handmaid. Thou have loosed my bonds.
I will offer to thee the sacrifice of thanksgiving, and will call upon the name of Jehovah.
I will pay my vows to Jehovah, yea, in the presence of all his people,
in the courts of Jehovah's house, in the midst of thee, O Jerusalem. Praise ye Jehovah.

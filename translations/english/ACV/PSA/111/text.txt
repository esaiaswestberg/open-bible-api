Praise ye Jehovah. I will give thanks to Jehovah with my whole heart, in the council of the upright, and in the congregation.
The works of Jehovah are great, sought out by all those who have pleasure in it.
His work is honor and majesty, and his righteousness endures forever.
He has made his wonderful works to be remembered. Jehovah is gracious and merciful.
He has given food to those who fear him. He will ever be mindful of his covenant.
He has shown his people the power of his works, in giving them the heritage of the nations.
The works of his hands are truth and justice. All his precepts are sure.
They are established forever and ever. They are done in truth and uprightness.
He has sent redemption to his people. He has commanded his covenant forever. Holy and reverend is his name.
The fear of Jehovah is the beginning of wisdom, and all who act accordingly have a good understanding. His praise endures forever.

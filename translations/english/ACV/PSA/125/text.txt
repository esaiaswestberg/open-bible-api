Those who trust in Jehovah are as mount Zion, which cannot be moved, but abides forever.
As the mountains are round about Jerusalem, so Jehovah is round about his people from this time forth and for evermore.
For the scepter of wickedness shall not rest upon the lot of the righteous, that the righteous not put forth their hands to iniquity.
Do good, O Jehovah, to those who are good, and to those who are upright in their hearts.
But as for such as turn aside to their crooked ways, Jehovah will lead them forth with the workers of iniquity. Peace be upon Israel.

I will extol thee, O Jehovah, for thou have raised me up, and have not made my foes to rejoice over me.
O Jehovah my God, I cried to thee, and thou have healed me.
O Jehovah, thou have brought up my soul from Sheol. Thou have kept me alive, that I should not go down to the pit.
Sing praise to Jehovah, O ye sanctified of his, and give thanks to his holiness.
For his anger is but for a moment. His favor is for a lifetime. Weeping may tarry for the night, but joy is in the morning.
As for me, I said in my prosperity, I shall never be moved.
Thou, Jehovah, of thy favor had made my mountain to stand strong. Thou hid thy face; I was troubled.
I cried to thee, O Jehovah, and to Jehovah I made supplication.
What profit is there in my blood when I go down to the pit? Shall the dust praise thee? Shall it declare thy truth?
Hear, O Jehovah, and have mercy upon me. Jehovah, be thou my helper.
Thou have turned for me my mourning into dancing. Thou have loosed my sackcloth, and girded me with gladness,
to the end that my glory may sing praise to thee, and not be silent. O Jehovah my God, I will give thanks to thee forever.

Hasten, O God, to deliver me. Make haste to help me, O Jehovah.
Let them be put to shame and confounded who seek after my soul. Let them be turned backward and brought to dishonor who delight in my hurt.
Let them be turned back because of their shame who say, Aha, aha.
Let all those who seek thee rejoice and be glad in thee. And let such as love thy salvation say continually, Let God be magnified.
But I am poor and needy. Make haste to me, O God. Thou are my help and my deliverer, O Jehovah. Delay thou not.

Jehovah, remember for David all his affliction,
how he swore to Jehovah, and vowed to the Mighty One of Jacob:
Surely I will not come into the tabernacle of my house, nor go up into my bed,
I will not give sleep to my eyes, or slumber to my eyelids,
until I find out a place for Jehovah, a tabernacle for the Mighty One of Jacob.
Lo, we heard of it in Ephrathah. We found it in the field of the wood.
We will go into his tabernacles. We will worship at his footstool.
Arise, O Jehovah, into thy resting-place, thou, and the ark of thy strength.
Let thy priest be clothed with righteousness, and let thy sanctified shout for joy.
For thy servant David's sake turn not away the face of thine anointed.
Jehovah has sworn to David in truth. He will not turn from it: From the fruit of thy body I will set upon thy throne.
If thy sons will keep my covenant and my testimony that I shall teach them, their sons also shall sit upon thy throne for evermore.
For Jehovah has chosen Zion. He has desired it for his habitation.
This is my resting place forever. Here I will dwell, for I have desired it.
I will abundantly bless her provision. I will satisfy her poor with bread.
I will also clothe her priests with salvation, and her sanctified shall shout aloud for joy.
There I will make the horn of David to bud. I have ordained a lamp for my anointed.
I will clothe his enemies with shame, but upon himself his crown shall flourish.

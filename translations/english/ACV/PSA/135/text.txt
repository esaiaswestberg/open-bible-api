Praise ye Jehovah. Praise ye the name of Jehovah. Praise, O ye servants of Jehovah,
ye who stand in the house of Jehovah, in the courts of the house of our God.
Praise ye Jehovah, for Jehovah is good. Sing praises to his name, for it is pleasant.
For Jehovah has chosen Jacob to himself, Israel for his own possession.
For I know that Jehovah is great, and that our Lord is above all gods.
Whatever Jehovah pleased, that he has done, in heaven and in earth, in the seas and in all deeps,
who causes the vapors to ascend from the ends of the earth, who makes lightnings for the rain, who brings forth the wind out of his treasuries,
who smote the firstborn of Egypt, both of man and beast,
who sent signs and wonders into the midst of thee, O Egypt, upon Pharaoh, and upon all his servants,
who smote many nations, and killed mighty kings-
Sihon king of the Amorites, and Og king of Bashan, and all the kingdoms of Canaan-
and gave their land for a heritage, a heritage to Israel his people.
Thy name, O Jehovah, is forever, thy memorial, O Jehovah, throughout all generations.
For Jehovah will judge his people, and will relent concerning his servants.
The idols of the nations are silver and gold, the work of men's hands.
They have mouths, but they speak not. They have eyes, but they see not.
They have ears, but they hear not, nor is there any breath in their mouths.
Those who make them shall be like them, yea, everyone who trusts in them.
O house of Israel, bless ye Jehovah. O house of Aaron, bless ye Jehovah.
O house of Levi, bless ye Jehovah. Ye who fear Jehovah, bless ye Jehovah.
Blessed be Jehovah out of Zion, who dwells at Jerusalem. Praise ye Jehovah.

The king shall joy in thy strength, O Jehovah. And in thy salvation how greatly he shall rejoice!
Thou have given him his heart's desire, and have not withheld the request of his lips. Selah.
For thou meet him with the blessings of goodness. Thou set a crown of fine gold on his head.
He asked life from thee. Thou gave it him, even length of days forever and ever.
His glory is great in thy salvation. Honor and majesty thou do lay upon him.
For thou make him most blessed forever. Thou make him glad with joy in thy presence.
For the king trusts in Jehovah. And through the loving kindness of the Most High he shall not be moved.
Thy hand will find out all thine enemies. Thy right hand will find out those who hate thee.
Thou will make them as a fiery furnace in the time of thine anger. Jehovah will swallow them up in his wrath, and the fire shall devour them.
Thou will destroy their fruit from the earth, and their seed from among the sons of men.
For they intended evil against thee. They conceived a device which they are not able to perform.
For thou will make them turn their back. Thou will make ready with thy bowstrings against their face.
Be thou exalted, O Jehovah, in thy strength. We will sing and praise thy power.

O clap your hands, all ye peoples. Shout to God with the voice of triumph.
For Jehovah Most High is awesome. He is a great King over all the earth.
He subdues peoples under us, and nations under our feet.
He chooses our inheritance for us, the glory of Jacob whom he loved. Selah.
God has gone up with a shout, Jehovah with the sound of a trumpet.
Sing praise to God, sing praises. Sing praises to our King, sing praises.
For God is the King of all the earth. Sing ye praises with understanding.
God reigns over the nations. God sits upon his holy throne.
The nobles of the peoples are gathered together, the people of the God of Abraham. For the shields of the earth belong to God. He is greatly exalted.

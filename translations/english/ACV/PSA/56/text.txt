Be merciful to me, O God, for man would swallow me up. Fighting all the day long he oppresses me.
My enemies would swallow me up all the day long, for they are many who fight proudly against me.
What time I am afraid, I will put my trust in thee.
In God I will praise his word. In God I have put my trust. I will not be afraid. What can flesh do to me?
All the day long they wrest my words. All their thoughts are against me for evil.
They gather themselves together. They hide themselves. They mark my steps, even as they have waited for my soul.
Shall they escape by iniquity? In anger cast down the peoples, O God.
Thou number my wanderings. Put thou my tears into thy bottle. Are they not in thy book?
Then shall my enemies turn back in the day that I call. This I know, that God is for me.
In God I will praise his word. In Jehovah I will praise his word.
In God I have put my trust. I will not be afraid. What can man do to me?
Thy vows are upon me, O God. I will render thank offerings to thee.
For thou have delivered my soul from death, and my feet from falling, that I may walk before God in the light of the living.

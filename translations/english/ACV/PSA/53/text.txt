The fool has said in his heart, There is no God. Corrupt are they, and have done abominable iniquity. There is none who does good.
God looked down from heaven upon the sons of men, to see if there were any who understood, who seek after God.
Every one of them has gone back. They have together become filthy. There is none who does good, no, not one.
Have the workers of iniquity no knowledge, who eat up my people as they eat bread, and call not upon God?
There they were in great fear, where no fear was, for God has scattered the bones of him who encamps against thee. Thou have put them to shame because God has rejected them.
O that the salvation of Israel came out of Zion! When God brings back the captivity of his people, then Jacob shall rejoice, and Israel shall be glad.

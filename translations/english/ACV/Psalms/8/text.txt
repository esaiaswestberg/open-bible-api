O Jehovah, our Lord, how excellent is thy name in all the earth, who has set thy glory upon the heavens!
Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings thou have perfected praise, because of thine adversaries, that thou might still the enemy and the avenger.
When I consider thy heavens, the work of thy fingers, the moon and the stars, which thou have ordained,
what is man that thou remember him? And the son of man that thou succor him?
For thou have made him but little lower than agents, and crowned him with glory and honor.
Thou make him to have dominion over the works of thy hands. Thou have put all things under his feet.
All sheep and oxen, yea, and the beasts of the field,
the birds of the heavens, and the fish of the sea, whatever passes through the paths of the seas.
O Jehovah, our Lord, how excellent is thy name in all the earth!

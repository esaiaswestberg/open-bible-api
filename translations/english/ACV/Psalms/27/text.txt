Jehovah is my light and my salvation, whom shall I fear? Jehovah is the strength of my life, of whom shall I be afraid?
When evildoers came upon me to eat up my flesh, even my adversaries and my foes, they stumbled and fell.
Though an army should encamp against me, my heart shall not fear. Though war should rise against me, even then I will be confident.
One thing I have asked of Jehovah, that I will seek after, that I may dwell in the house of Jehovah all the days of my life, to behold the beauty of Jehovah, and to inquire in his temple.
For in the day of trouble he will hide me in his pavilion. In the covert of his tabernacle he will hide me. He will lift me up upon a rock.
And now my head shall be lifted up above my enemies round about me. And I will offer in his tabernacle sacrifices of joy. I will sing, yea, I will sing praises to Jehovah.
Hear, O Jehovah, when I cry with my voice. Have mercy also upon me, and answer me.
My heart said to thee, I have sought thy face. O Jehovah, I will seek thy face.
Hide not thy face from me. Put not thy servant away in anger. Thou have been my help. Cast me not off, nor forsake me, O God of my salvation.
When my father and my mother forsake me, then Jehovah will take me up.
Teach me thy way, O Jehovah, and lead me in a plain path, because of my enemies.
Deliver me not over to the will of my adversaries. For false witnesses are risen up against me, and such as breathe out cruelty.
I believe that I shall see the goodness of Jehovah in the land of the living.
Wait for Jehovah. Be strong, and let thy heart take courage. Yea, wait thou for Jehovah.

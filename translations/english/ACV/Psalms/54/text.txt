Save me, O God, by thy name, and judge me in thy might.
Hear my prayer, O God. Give ear to the words of my mouth.
For strangers are risen up against me, and violent men have sought after my soul. They have not set God before them. Selah.
Behold, God is my helper. The Lord is of those who uphold my soul.
He will requite the evil to my enemies. Destroy thou them in thy truth.
With a freewill offering I will sacrifice to thee. I will give thanks to thy name, O Jehovah, for it is good.
For he has delivered me out of all trouble, and my eye has seen it upon my enemies.

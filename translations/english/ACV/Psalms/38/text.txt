O Jehovah, rebuke me not in thy wrath, nor chasten me in thy hot displeasure.
For thine arrows stick fast in me, and thy hand presses me severely.
There is no soundness in my flesh because of thine indignation, nor is there any health in my bones because of my sin.
For my iniquities have gone over my head. As a heavy burden they are too heavy for me.
My wounds are loathsome and corrupt, because of my foolishness.
I am pained and bowed down greatly. I go mourning all the day long.
For my loins are filled with burning, and there is no soundness in my flesh.
I am faint and severely bruised. I have groaned because of the disquietness of my heart.
Lord, all my desire is before thee, and my groaning is not hid from thee.
My heart throbs, my strength fails me. As for the light of my eyes, it also is gone from me.
Those I love and my friends stand aloof from my plague, and my kinsmen stand afar off.
Those also who seek after my life lay snares for me. And those who seek my hurt speak mischievous things, and meditate deceits all the day long.
But I, as a deaf man, hear not. And I am as a mute man who opens not his mouth.
Yea, I am as a man who hears not, and in whose mouth are no reproofs.
For in thee, O Jehovah, do I hope. Thou will answer, O Lord my God.
For I said, Lest they rejoice over me. When my foot slips, they magnify themselves against me.
For I am ready to fall, and my sorrow is continually before me.
For I will declare my iniquity. I will be sorry for my sin.
But my enemies are energetic, and are strong, and those who hate me wrongfully are multiplied.
They also who render evil for good are adversaries to me, because I follow the thing that is good.
Forsake me not, O Jehovah. O my God, be not far from me.
Make haste to help me, O Lord, my salvation.

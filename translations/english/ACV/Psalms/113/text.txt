Praise ye Jehovah. Praise, O ye servants of Jehovah. Praise the name of Jehovah.
Blessed be the name of Jehovah from this time forth and for evermore.
From the rising of the sun to the going down of the same Jehovah's name is to be praised.
Jehovah is high above all nations, and his glory above the heavens.
Who is like Jehovah our God who has his seat on high,
and yet looks upon the low things in heaven and in the earth.
He raises up a poor man out of the dust, and lifts up a needy man from the dunghill,
that he may set him with rulers, even with the rulers of his people.
He makes the barren woman to keep house, a joyful mother of sons. Praise ye Jehovah.

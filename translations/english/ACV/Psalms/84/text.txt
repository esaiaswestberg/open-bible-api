How amiable are thy tabernacles, O Jehovah of hosts!
My soul longs, yea, even faints for the courts of Jehovah. My heart and my flesh cry out to the living God.
Yea, the sparrow has found her a house, and the swallow a nest for herself where she may lay her young, even thine altars, O Jehovah of hosts, my King and my God.
Blessed are those who dwell in thy house. They will still be praising thee. Selah.
Blessed is the man whose strength is in thee, in whose heart are the highways to Zion.
Passing through the valley of weeping they make it a place of springs. Yea, the early rain covers it with blessings.
They go from strength to strength; each one of them appears before God in Zion.
O Jehovah God of hosts, hear my prayer. Give ear, O God of Jacob. Selah.
Behold, O God our shield, and look upon the face of thine anointed.
For a day in thy courts is better than a thousand. I had rather be a doorkeeper in the house of my God, than to dwell in the tents of wickedness.
For Jehovah God is a sun and a shield. Jehovah will give grace and glory. He will withhold no good thing from those who walk uprightly.
O Jehovah of hosts, blessed is the man who trusts in thee.

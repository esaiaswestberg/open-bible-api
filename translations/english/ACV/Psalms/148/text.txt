Praise ye Jehovah. Praise ye Jehovah from the heavens. Praise him in the heights.
Praise ye him, all his agents. Praise ye him, all his host.
Praise ye him, sun and moon. Praise him, all ye stars of light.
Praise him, ye heavens of heavens, and ye waters that are above the heavens.
Let them praise the name of Jehovah. For he commanded, and they were created.
He has also established them forever and ever. He has made a decree which shall not pass away.
Praise Jehovah from the earth, ye sea-monsters, and all deeps,
fire and hail, snow and vapor, stormy wind, fulfilling his word,
mountains and all hills, fruitful trees and all cedars,
beasts and all cattle, creeping things and flying birds,
kings of the earth and all peoples, rulers and all judges of the earth,
both young men and virgins, old men and sons.
Let them praise the name of Jehovah, for his name alone is exalted. His glory is above the earth and the heavens.
And he has lifted up the horn of his people, the praise of all his sanctified, even of the sons of Israel, a people near to him. Praise ye Jehovah.

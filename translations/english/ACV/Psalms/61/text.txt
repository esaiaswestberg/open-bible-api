Hear my cry, O God. Attend to my prayer.
From the end of the earth I will call to thee when my heart is overwhelmed. Lead me to the rock that is higher than I.
For thou have been a refuge for me, a strong tower from the enemy.
I will dwell in thy tabernacle forever. I will take refuge in the covert of thy wings. Selah.
For thou, O God, have heard my vows. Thou have given me the heritage of those who fear thy name.
Thou will prolong the king's life. His years shall be as many generations.
He shall abide before God forever. O prepare loving kindness and truth that they may preserve him.
So I will sing praise to thy name forever, that I may daily perform my vows.

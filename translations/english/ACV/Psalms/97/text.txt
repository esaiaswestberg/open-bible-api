Jehovah reigns! Let the earth rejoice. Let the multitude of isles be glad.
Clouds and darkness are round about him. Righteousness and justice are the foundation of his throne.
A fire goes before him, and burns up his adversaries round about.
His lightnings lightened the world. The earth saw, and trembled.
The mountains melted like wax at the presence of Jehovah, at the presence of the Lord of the whole earth.
The heavens declare his righteousness, and all the peoples have seen his glory.
Let all those be put to shame who serve graven images, who boast themselves of idols. Bow yourselves to him, all ye gods.
Zion heard and was glad, and the daughters of Judah rejoiced, because of thy judgments, O Jehovah.
For thou, Jehovah, are most high above all the earth. Thou are exalted far above all gods.
O ye who love Jehovah, hate evil. He preserves the souls of his sanctified. He delivers them out of the hand of the wicked.
Light is sown for the righteous man, and gladness for the upright in heart.
Be glad in Jehovah, ye righteous, and give thanks to the memory of his holiness.

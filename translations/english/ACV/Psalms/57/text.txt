Be merciful to me, O God, be merciful to me, for my soul takes refuge in thee. Yea, in the shadow of thy wings I will take refuge until calamities be passed by.
I will cry to God Most High, to God who performs for me.
He will send from heaven, and save me from the reproach of him who would swallow me up. Selah. God will send forth his loving kindness and his truth.
My soul is among lions. I lie among those who are set on fire, even the sons of men, whose teeth are spears and arrows, and their tongue a sharp sword.
Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens, thy glory above all the earth.
They have prepared a net for my steps. My soul is bowed down. They have dug a pit before me. They are fallen into the midst of it themselves. Selah.
My heart is fixed, O God, my heart is fixed. I will sing, yea, I will sing praises.
Awake up, my glory. Awake, psaltery and harp. I myself will awake right early.
I will give thanks to thee, O Lord, among the peoples. I will sing praises to thee among the nations.
For thy loving kindness is great to the heavens, and thy truth to the skies.
Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens, thy glory above all the earth.

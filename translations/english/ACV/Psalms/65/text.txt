Praise waits for thee, O God, in Zion. And to thee the vow shall be performed.
O thou who hear prayer, to thee all flesh shall come.
Iniquities prevail against me. As for our transgressions, thou will forgive them.
Blessed is the man whom thou choose and cause to approach, that he may dwell in thy courts. We shall be satisfied with the goodness of thy house, thy holy temple.
By awesome things thou will answer us in righteousness, O God of our salvation, thou who are the confidence of all the ends of the earth, and of those who are afar off upon the sea,
who by his strength sets firm the mountains, being girded about with might,
who stills the roaring of the seas, the roaring of their waves, and the tumult of the peoples.
They also who dwell in the outermost parts are afraid at thy signs. Thou make the outgoings of the morning and evening to rejoice.
Thou visit the earth, and water it; thou greatly enrich it. The river of God is full of water. Thou provide them grain when thou have so prepared the earth.
Thou water its furrows abundantly. Thou settle the ridges of it. Thou make it soft with showers. Thou bless the springing of it.
Thou crown the year with thy goodness, and thy paths drop fatness.
They drop upon the pastures of the wilderness, and the hills are girded with joy.
The pastures are clothed with flocks. The valleys also are covered over with grain. They shout for joy; they also sing.

Blessed be Jehovah, my rock, who teaches my hands to war, and my fingers to fight,
my loving kindness, and my fortress, my high tower, and my deliverer, my shield, and he in whom I take refuge, who subdues my people under me.
Jehovah, what is man, that thou take knowledge of him? Or the son of man, that thou make account of him?
Man is like vanity. His days are as a shadow that passes away.
Bow thy heavens, O Jehovah, and come down. Touch the mountains, and they shall smoke.
Cast forth lightning, and scatter them. Send out thine arrows, and discomfit them.
Stretch forth thy hand from above. Rescue me, and deliver me out of great waters, out of the hand of aliens,
whose mouth speaks deceit, and whose right hand is a right hand of falsehood.
I will sing a new song to thee, O God. Upon a psaltery of ten strings I will sing praises to thee.
Thou are he who gives salvation to kings, who rescues David his servant from the hurtful sword.
Rescue me, and deliver me out of the hand of aliens, whose mouth speaks deceit, and whose right hand is a right hand of falsehood.
That our sons shall be as plants grown up in their youth, and our daughters as cornerstones hewn according to the fashion of a palace,
our garners are full, affording all manner of store, our sheep bring forth thousands and ten thousands in our fields,
our oxen are well laden, no breaking in, and no going forth, and no outcry in our streets,
blessed are the people who are in such a case. Blessed are the people whose God is Jehovah.

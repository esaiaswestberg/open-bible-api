I will give thanks to Jehovah with my whole heart. I will show forth all thy marvelous works.
I will be glad and exult in thee. I will sing praise to thy name, O thou Most High.
When my enemies turn back, they stumble and perish at thy presence.
For thou have maintained my right and my cause. Thou sit in the throne judging righteously.
Thou have rebuked the nations. Thou have destroyed the wicked. Thou have blotted out their name forever and ever.
The enemy have come to an end. They are desolate forever, and the cities which thou have overthrown. The very memory of them is perished,
but Jehovah will endure forever. He has prepared his throne for judgment,
and he will judge the world in righteousness. He will minister justice to the peoples in uprightness.
Jehovah will also be a high tower for the oppressed, a high tower in times of trouble.
And those who know thy name will put their trust in thee, for thou, Jehovah, have not forsaken those who seek thee.
Sing praises to Jehovah, who dwells in Zion. Declare among the people his doings.
For he who makes inquiry for blood remembers them. He does not forget the cry of the poor.
Have mercy upon me, O Jehovah. Behold my affliction from those who hate me, thou who lifts me up from the gates of death
that I may show forth all thy praise. In the gates of the daughter of Zion I will rejoice in thy salvation.
The nations are sunk down in the pit that they made. In the net which they hid, their own foot is taken.
Jehovah has made himself known. He has executed justice. The wicked man is snared in the work of his own hands. Higgaion. Selah.
Wicked men shall be turned back to Sheol, even all the nations that forget God.
For a needy man shall not always be forgotten, nor the expectation of the poor perish forever.
Arise, O Jehovah, let not man prevail. Let the nations be judged in thy sight.
Put them in fear, O Jehovah. Let the nations know themselves to be but men. Selah.

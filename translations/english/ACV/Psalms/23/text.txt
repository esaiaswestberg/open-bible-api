Jehovah is my shepherd, I shall not want.
He makes me to lie down in green pastures. He leads me beside still waters.
He restores my soul. He guides me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake.
Yea, tho I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil, for thou are with me, thy rod and thy staff, they comfort me.
Thou prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies. Thou have anointed my head with oil. My cup runs over.
Surely goodness and loving kindness shall follow me all the days of my life, and I shall dwell in the house of Jehovah forever.

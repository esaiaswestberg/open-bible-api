The transgression of the wicked man says within my heart, There is no fear of God before his eyes.
For he flatters himself in his own eyes, that his iniquity will not be found out and be hated.
The words of his mouth are iniquity and deceit. He has ceased to be wise and to do good.
He devises iniquity upon his bed. He sets himself in a way that is not good. He does not abhor evil.
Thy loving kindness, O Jehovah, is in the heavens, thy faithfulness to the skies.
Thy righteousness is like the mountains of God. Thy judgments are a great deep. O Jehovah, thou preserve man and beast.
How precious is thy loving kindness, O God, and the sons of men take refuge under the shadow of thy wings.
They shall be abundantly satisfied with the fatness of thy house, and thou will make them drink of the river of thy pleasures.
For with thee is the fountain of life. In thy light we shall see light.
O continue thy loving kindness to those who know thee, and thy righteousness to the upright in heart.
Let not the foot of pride come against me, and let not the hand of sinners drive me away.
There are the workers of iniquity fallen. They are thrust down, and shall not be able to rise.

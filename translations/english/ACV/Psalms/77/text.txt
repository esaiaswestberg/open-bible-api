I will cry to God with my voice, even to God with my voice, and he will give ear to me.
In the day of my trouble I sought the Lord. My hand was stretched out in the night, and slacked not. My soul refused to be comforted.
I remember God, and am disquieted. I complain, and my spirit is overwhelmed. Selah.
Thou have held my eyelids watching. I am so troubled that I cannot speak.
I have considered the days of old, the years of ancient times.
I call to remembrance my song in the night. I commune with my own heart, and my spirit makes diligent search.
Will the Lord cast off forever? And will he be favorable no more?
Has his loving kindness entirely gone forever? Does his promise fail for evermore?
Has God forgotten to be gracious? Has he in anger shut up his tender mercies? Selah.
And I said, This is my infirmity, the change of the right hand of the Most High.
I will make mention of the deeds of Jehovah, for I will remember thy wonders of old.
I will meditate also upon all thy work, and muse on thy doings.
Thy way, O God, is in the sanctuary. Who is a great god like God?
Thou are the God who does wonders. Thou have made known thy strength among the peoples.
With thine arm thou have redeemed thy people, the sons of Jacob and Joseph. Selah.
The waters saw thee, O God, the waters saw thee. They were afraid. The depths also trembled.
The clouds poured out water. The skies sent out a sound. Thine arrows also went abroad.
The voice of thy thunder was in the whirlwind. The lightnings lightened the world. The earth trembled and shook.
Thy way was in the sea, and thy paths in the great waters. And thy footsteps were not known.
Thou led thy people like a flock by the hand of Moses and Aaron.

Why boast thou thyself in mischief, O mighty man? The loving kindness of God is continual.
Thy tongue devises wickedness, like a sharp razor, working deceitfully.
Thou love evil more than good, and lying rather than to speak righteousness. Selah.
Thou love all devouring words, O thou deceitful tongue.
God will likewise destroy thee forever. He will take thee up, and pluck thee out of thy tent, and root thee out of the land of the living. Selah.
The righteous also shall see, and fear, and shall laugh at him, saying,
Lo, this is the man who did not make God his strength, but trusted in the abundance of his riches, and strengthened himself in his wickedness.
But as for me, I am like a green olive tree in the house of God. I trust in the loving kindness of God forever and ever.
I will give thee thanks forever, because thou have done it. And I will hope in thy name in the presence of thy sanctified, for it is good.

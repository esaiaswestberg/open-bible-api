O sing to Jehovah a new song. Sing to Jehovah, all the earth.
Sing to Jehovah, bless his name. Show forth his salvation from day to day.
Declare his glory among the nations, his marvelous works among all the peoples.
For great is Jehovah, and greatly to be praised. He is to be feared above all gods.
For all the gods of the peoples are idols, but Jehovah made the heavens.
Honor and majesty are before him. Strength and beauty are in his sanctuary.
Ascribe to Jehovah, ye kindred of the peoples. Ascribe to Jehovah glory and strength.
Ascribe to Jehovah the glory due to his name. Bring an offering, and come into his courts.
O worship Jehovah in holy array. Tremble before him, all the earth.
Say among the nations, Jehovah reigns! The world also is established that it cannot be moved. He will judge the peoples with equity.
Let the heavens be glad, and let the earth rejoice. Let the sea roar, and the fullness thereof.
Let the field exult, and all that is in it. Then all the trees of the wood shall sing for joy
before Jehovah, for he comes. For he comes to judge the earth. He will judge the world with righteousness, and the peoples with his truth.

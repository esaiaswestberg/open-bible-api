Give ear to my words, O Jehovah, Consider my meditation.
Hearken to the voice of my cry, my King, and my God, for to thee do I pray.
O Jehovah, in the morning thou shall hear my voice. In the morning I will direct to thee, and will keep watch.
For thou are not a God who has pleasure in wickedness. Evil shall not sojourn with thee.
The arrogant shall not stand in thy sight. Thou hate all workers of iniquity.
Thou will destroy those who speak lies. Jehovah abhors the blood-thirsty and deceitful man.
But as for me, in the abundance of thy loving kindness I will come into thy house. In thy fear I will worship toward thy holy temple.
Lead me, O Jehovah, in thy righteousness because of my enemies. Make thy way straight before my face.
For there is no faithfulness in their mouth. Their inward part is very wickedness. Their throat is an open sepulcher. With their tongue they deceive.
Hold them guilty, O God. Let them fall by their own counsels. Thrust them out in the multitude of their transgressions. For they have rebelled against thee.
But let all those who take refuge in thee rejoice. Let them ever shout for joy, because thou defend them. Let those also who love thy name be joyful in thee.
For thou will bless the righteous man, O Jehovah. Thou will encompass him with favor as with a shield. Selah.

Deliver me, O Jehovah, from the evil man. Preserve me from the violent man,
and men who devise mischievous things in their heart. They gather themselves continually together for war.
They have sharpened their tongue like a serpent. Adders' poison is under their lips. Selah.
Keep me, O Jehovah, from the hands of a wicked man. Preserve me from violent men, who have purposed to thrust aside my steps.
The proud have hid a snare for me, and cords. They have spread a net by the wayside. They have set snares for me. Selah.
I said to Jehovah, Thou are my God. Give ear to the voice of my supplications, O Jehovah.
O Jehovah the Lord, the strength of my salvation, thou have covered my head in the day of battle.
Grant not, O Jehovah, the desires of the wicked man. Do not further his evil device. They exalt themselves. Selah.
As for the head of those who encompass me around, let the mischief of their own lips cover them.
Let burning coals fall upon them. Let them be cast into the fire, into deep pits, from where they shall not rise.
An evil speaker shall not be established in the earth. Evil shall hunt the violent man to overthrow him.
I know that Jehovah will maintain the cause of the afflicted man, and justice for the needy.
Surely the righteous shall give thanks to thy name. The upright shall dwell in thy presence.

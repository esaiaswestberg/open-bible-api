The earth is Jehovah's, and the fullness thereof, the world, and those who dwell therein.
For he has founded it upon the seas, and established it upon the floods.
Who shall ascend into the hill of Jehovah? And who shall stand in his holy place?
He who has clean hands, and a pure heart, who has not lifted up his soul to falsehood, and has not sworn deceitfully.
He shall receive a blessing from Jehovah, and righteousness from the God of his salvation.
This is the generation of those who seek after him, who seek thy face, even Jacob. Selah.
Lift up your heads, O ye gates, and be ye lifted up, ye everlasting doors, and the King of glory will come in.
Who is the King of glory? Jehovah strong and mighty, Jehovah mighty in battle.
Lift up your heads, O ye gates. Yea, lift them up, ye everlasting doors, and the King of glory will come in.
Who is this King of glory? Jehovah of hosts, He is the King of glory. Selah.

Jehovah, I have called upon thee. Make haste to me. Give ear to my voice when I call to thee.
Let my prayer be set forth as incense before thee, the lifting up of my hands as the evening sacrifice.
Set a watch, O Jehovah, before my mouth. Keep the door of my lips.
Incline not my heart to any evil thing, to practice deeds of wickedness with men who work iniquity. And let me not eat of their dainties.
Let a righteous man smite me, as a kindness. And let him reprove me, as oil upon the head. Let not my head refuse it. For even in their wickedness my prayer shall continue.
Their judges are thrown down by the sides of the rock. And they shall hear my words, for they are sweet.
Like plowing and furrowing the earth, our bones are scattered at the mouth of Sheol.
For my eyes are to thee, O Jehovah the Lord. In thee do I take refuge. Leave not my soul destitute.
Keep me from the snare which they have laid for me, and from the traps of the workers of iniquity.
Let the wicked fall into their own nets, while I pass over.

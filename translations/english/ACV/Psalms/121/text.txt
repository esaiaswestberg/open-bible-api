I will lift up my eyes to the mountains. From where shall my help come?
My help is from Jehovah, who made heaven and earth.
He will not allow thy foot to be moved. He who keeps thee will not slumber.
Behold, he who keeps Israel will neither slumber nor sleep.
Jehovah is thy keeper. Jehovah is thy shade upon thy right hand.
The sun shall not smite thee by day, nor the moon by night.
Jehovah will keep thee from all evil. He will keep thy soul.
Jehovah will keep thy going out and thy coming in from this time forth and for evermore.

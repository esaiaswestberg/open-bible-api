Make a joyful noise to God, all the earth.
Sing forth the glory of his name. Make his praise glorious.
Say to God, How awesome are thy works! Through the greatness of thy power thine enemies shall submit themselves to thee.
All the earth shall worship thee, and shall sing to thee. They shall sing to thy name. Selah.
Come, and see the works of God, awesome in actions toward the sons of men.
He turned the sea into dry land. They went through the river on foot. There we rejoiced in him.
He rules by his might forever. His eyes observe the nations. Let not the rebellious exalt themselves. Selah.
O bless our God, ye peoples, and make the voice of his praise to be heard,
who holds our soul in life, and does not allow our feet to be moved.
For thou, O God, have proved us. Thou have tried us as silver is tried.
Thou brought us into the net. Thou laid a great burden upon our loins.
Thou caused men to ride over our heads. We went through fire and through water. But thou brought us out into a wealthy place.
I will come into thy house with burnt offerings. I will pay thee my vows,
which my lips uttered, and my mouth spoke, when I was in distress.
I will offer to thee burnt offerings of fatlings, with the incense of rams. I will offer bullocks with goats. Selah.
Come, and hear, all ye who fear God, and I will declare what he has done for my soul.
I cried to him with my mouth, and he was extolled with my tongue.
If I regard iniquity in my heart, the Lord will not hear.
But truly God has heard. He has attended to the voice of my prayer.
Blessed be God, who has not turned away my prayer, nor his loving kindness from me.

In Judah God is known. His name is great in Israel.
In Salem also is his tabernacle, and his dwelling-place in Zion.
There he broke the arrows of the bow, the shield, and the sword, and the battle. Selah.
Thou are more glorious and excellent than the mountains of prey.
The stouthearted are made a spoil. They have slept their sleep, and none of the men of might have found their hands.
At thy rebuke, O God of Jacob, both chariot and horse are cast into a deep sleep.
Thou, even thou, are to be feared. And who may stand in thy sight when once thou are angry?
Thou caused sentence to be heard from heaven. The earth feared and was still
when God arose to judgment, to save all the meek of the earth. Selah.
Surely the inward thought of man shall praise thee, even the residue of inward thought will observe a festival to thee.
Vow, and pay to Jehovah your God. Let all who are round about him bring presents to him who ought to be feared.
He will cut off the spirit of rulers. He is fearful to the kings of the earth.

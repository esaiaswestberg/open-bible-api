Then Jonah prayed unto the LORD his God out of the fish's belly,
And said, I cried by reason of mine affliction unto the LORD, and he heard me; out of the belly of hell cried I, and you heard my voice.
For you had cast me into the deep, in the midst of the seas; and the floods compassed me about: all your billows and your waves passed over me.
Then I said, I am cast out of your sight; yet I will look again toward your holy temple.
The waters compassed me about, even to the soul: the depth closed me round about, the weeds were wrapped about my head.
I went down to the bottoms of the mountains; the earth with her bars was about me for ever: yet have you brought up my life from corruption, O LORD my God.
When my soul fainted within me I remembered the LORD: and my prayer came in unto you, into your holy temple.
They that observe lying vanities forsake their own mercy.
But I will sacrifice unto you with the voice of thanksgiving; I will pay that that I have vowed. Salvation is of the LORD.
And the LORD spoke unto the fish, and it vomited out Jonah upon the dry land.

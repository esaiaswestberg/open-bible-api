I will lift up mine eyes unto the hills, from whence comes my help.
My help comes from the LORD, which made heaven and earth.
He will not suffer your foot to be moved: he that keeps you will not slumber.
Behold, he that keeps Israel shall neither slumber nor sleep.
The LORD is your keeper: the LORD is your shade upon your right hand.
The sun shall not strike you by day, nor the moon by night.
The LORD shall preserve you from all evil: he shall preserve your soul.
The LORD shall preserve your going out and your coming in from this time forth, and even for evermore.

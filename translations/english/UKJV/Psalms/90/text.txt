Lord, you have been our dwelling place in all generations.
Before the mountains were brought forth, before even you had formed the earth and the world, even from everlasting to everlasting, you are God.
You turn man to destruction; and say, Return, all of you children of men.
For a thousand years in your sight are but as yesterday when it is past, and as a watch in the night.
You carry them away as with a flood; they are as a sleep: in the morning they are like grass which grows up.
In the morning it flourishes, and grows up; in the evening it is cut down, and withers.
For we are consumed by your anger, and by your wrath are we troubled.
You have set our iniquities before you, our secret sins in the light of your countenance.
For all our days are passed away in your wrath: we spend our years as a tale that is told.
The days of our years are threescore years and ten; and if by reason of strength they be fourscore years, yet is their strength labour and sorrow; for it is soon cut off, and we fly away.
Who knows the power of your anger? even according to your fear, so is your wrath.
So teach us to number our days, that we may apply our hearts unto wisdom.
Return, O LORD, how long? and let it repent you concerning your servants.
O satisfy us early with your mercy; that we may rejoice and be glad all our days.
Make us glad according to the days wherein you have afflicted us, and the years wherein we have seen evil.
Let your work appear unto your servants, and your glory unto their children.
And let the beauty of the LORD our God be upon us: and establish you the work of our hands upon us; yea, the work of our hands establish you it.

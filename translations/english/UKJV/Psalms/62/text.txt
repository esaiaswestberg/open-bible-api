Truly my soul waits upon God: from him comes my salvation.
He only is my rock and my salvation; he is my defence; I shall not be greatly moved.
How long will all of you imagine mischief against a man? all of you shall be slain all of you: as a bowing wall shall all of you be, and as a tottering fence.
They only consult to cast him down from his excellency: they delight in lies: they bless with their mouth, but they curse inwardly. Selah.
My soul, wait you only upon God; for my expectation is from him.
He only is my rock and my salvation: he is my defence; I shall not be moved.
In God is my salvation and my glory: the rock of my strength, and my refuge, is in God.
Trust in him at all times; all of you people, pour out your heart before him: God is a refuge for us. Selah.
Surely men of low degree are vanity, and men of high degree are a lie: to be laid in the balance, they are altogether lighter than vanity.
Trust not in oppression, and become not vain in robbery: if riches increase, set not your heart upon them.
God has spoken once; twice have I heard this; that power belongs unto God.
Also unto you, O Lord, belongs mercy: for you render to every man according to his work.

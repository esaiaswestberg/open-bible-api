MAKE HASTE, O GOD, TO DELIVER ME; MAKE HASTE TO HELP ME, O LORD.
Let them be ashamed and confounded that seek after my soul: let them be turned backward, and put to confusion, that desire my hurt.
Let them be turned back for a reward of their shame that say, Aha, aha.
Let all those that seek you rejoice and be glad in you: and let such as love your salvation say continually, Let God be magnified.
But I am poor and needy: make haste unto me, O God: you are my help and my deliverer; O LORD, make no tarrying.

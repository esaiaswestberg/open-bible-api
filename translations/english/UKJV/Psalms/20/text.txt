The LORD hear you in the day of trouble; the name of the God of Jacob defend you;
Send you help from the sanctuary, and strengthen you out of Zion;
Remember all your offerings, and accept your burnt sacrifice; Selah.
Grant you according to your own heart, and fulfill all your counsel.
We will rejoice in your salvation, and in the name of our God we will set up our banners: the LORD fulfill all your petitions.
Now know I that the LORD saves his anointed; he will hear him from his holy heaven with the saving strength of his right hand.
Some trust in chariots, and some in horses: but we will remember the name of the LORD our God.
They are brought down and fallen: but we are risen, and stand upright.
Save, LORD: let the king hear us when we call.

O LORD, rebuke me not in your anger, neither chasten me in your hot displeasure.
Have mercy upon me, O LORD; for I am weak: O LORD, heal me; for my bones are vexed.
My soul is also sore vexed: but you, O LORD, how long?
Return, O LORD, deliver my soul: oh save me for your mercies' sake.
For in death there is no remembrance of you: in the grave who shall give you thanks?
I am weary with my groaning; all the night make I my bed to swim; I water my couch with my tears.
Mine eye is consumed because of grief; it waxs old because of all mine enemies.
Depart from me, all you workers of iniquity; for the LORD has heard the voice of my weeping.
The LORD has heard my supplication; the LORD will receive my prayer.
Let all mine enemies be ashamed and sore vexed: let them return and be ashamed suddenly.

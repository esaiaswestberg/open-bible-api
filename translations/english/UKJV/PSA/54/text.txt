Save me, O God, by your name, and judge me by your strength.
Hear my prayer, O God; give ear to the words of my mouth.
For strangers are risen up against me, and oppressors seek after my soul: they have not set God before them. Selah.
Behold, God is mine helper: the Lord is with them that uphold my soul.
He shall reward evil unto mine enemies: cut them off in your truth.
I will freely sacrifice unto you: I will praise your name, O LORD; for it is good.
For he has delivered me out of all trouble: and mine eye has seen his desire upon mine enemies.

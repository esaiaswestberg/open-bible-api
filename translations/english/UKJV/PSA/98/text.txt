O sing unto the LORD a new song; for he has done marvellous things: his right hand, and his holy arm, has got him the victory.
The LORD has made known his salvation: his righteousness has he openly showed in the sight of the heathen.
He has remembered his mercy and his truth toward the house of Israel: all the ends of the earth have seen the salvation of our God.
Make a joyful noise unto the LORD, all the earth: make a loud noise, and rejoice, and sing praise.
Sing unto the LORD with the harp; with the harp, and the voice of a psalm.
With trumpets and sound of cornet make a joyful noise before the LORD, the King.
Let the sea roar, and the fullness thereof; the world, and they that dwell therein.
Let the floods clap their hands: let the hills be joyful together
Before the LORD; for he comes to judge the earth: with righteousness shall he judge the world, and the people with equity.

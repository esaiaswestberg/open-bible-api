Praise all of you the LORD. Praise the LORD, O my soul.
While I live will I praise the LORD: I will sing praises unto my God while I have any being.
Put not your trust in princes, nor in the son of man, in whom there is no help.
His breath goes forth, he returns to his earth; in that very day his thoughts perish.
Happy is he that has the God of Jacob for his help, whose hope is in the LORD his God:
Which made heaven, and earth, the sea, and all that therein is: which keeps truth for ever:
Which executes judgment for the oppressed: which gives food to the hungry. The LORD looses the prisoners:
The LORD opens the eyes of the blind: the LORD raises them that are bowed down: the LORD loves the righteous:
The LORD perserves the strangers; he relieves the fatherless and widow: but the way of the wicked he turns upside down.
The LORD shall reign for ever, even your God, O Zion, unto all generations. Praise all of you the LORD.

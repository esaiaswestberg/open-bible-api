Have mercy upon me, O God, according to your loving kindness: according unto the multitude of your tender mercies blot out my transgressions.
Wash me thoroughly from mine iniquity, and cleanse me from my sin.
For I acknowledge my transgressions: and my sin is ever before me.
Against you, you only, have I sinned, and done this evil in your sight: that you might be justified when you speak, and be clear when you judge.
Behold, I was formed in iniquity; and in sin did my mother conceive me.
Behold, you desire truth in the inward parts: and in the hidden part you shall make me to know wisdom.
Purge me with hyssop, and I shall be clean: wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.
Make me to hear joy and gladness; that the bones which you have broken may rejoice.
Hide your face from my sins, and blot out all mine iniquities.
Create in me a clean heart, O God; and renew a right spirit within me.
Cast me not away from your presence; and take not your holy spirit from me.
Restore unto me the joy of your salvation; and uphold me with your free spirit.
Then will I teach transgressors your ways; and sinners shall be converted unto you.
Deliver me from blood guiltiness, O God, you God of my salvation: and my tongue shall sing aloud of your righteousness.
O Lord, open you my lips; and my mouth shall show forth your praise.
For you desire not sacrifice; else would I give it: you delight not in burnt offering.
The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit: a broken and a contrite heart, O God, you will not despise.
Do good in your good pleasure unto Zion: build you the walls of Jerusalem.
Then shall you be pleased with the sacrifices of righteousness, with burnt offering and whole burnt offering: then shall they offer bullocks upon your altar.

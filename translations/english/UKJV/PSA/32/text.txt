Blessed is he whose transgression is forgiven, whose sin is covered.
Blessed is the man unto whom the LORD imputes not iniquity, and in whose spirit there is no guile.
When I kept silence, my bones waxed old through my roaring all the day long.
For day and night your hand was heavy upon me: my moisture is turned into the drought of summer. Selah.
I acknowledge my sin unto you, and mine iniquity have I not hid. I said, I will confess my transgressions unto the LORD; and you forgave the iniquity of my sin. Selah.
For this shall every one that is godly pray unto you in a time when you may be found: surely in the floods of great waters they shall not come nigh unto him.
You are my hiding place; you shall preserve me from trouble; you shall compass me about with songs of deliverance. Selah.
I will instruct you and teach you in the way which you shall go: I will guide you with mine eye.
Be all of you not as the horse, or as the mule, which have no understanding: whose mouth must be held in with bit and bridle, lest they come near unto you.
Many sorrows shall be to the wicked: but he that trusts in the LORD, mercy shall compass him about.
Be glad in the LORD, and rejoice, all of you righteous: and shout for joy, all you that are upright in heart.

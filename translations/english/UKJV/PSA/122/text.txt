I was glad when they said unto me, Let us go into the house of the LORD.
Our feet shall stand within your gates, O Jerusalem.
Jerusalem is built as a city that is compact together:
Where the tribes go up, the tribes of the LORD, unto the testimony of Israel, to give thanks unto the name of the LORD.
For there are set thrones of judgment, the thrones of the house of David.
Pray for the peace of Jerusalem: they shall prosper that love you.
Peace be within your walls, and prosperity within your palaces.
For my brethren and companions' sakes, I will now say, Peace be within you.
Because of the house of the LORD our God I will seek your good.

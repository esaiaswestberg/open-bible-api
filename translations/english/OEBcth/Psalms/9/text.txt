With all my heart I will praise the Lord, all your wonders I will rehearse.
I will rejoice and exult in you, singing praise to your name, Most High;
because backward my foes were turned, they stumbled and perished before you.
My right and my claim you have upheld, you did sit on the throne as a fair judge,
rebuking the nations, destroying the wicked, and blotting their name out forever and ever.
The foe is vanished, ruined forever, their cities destroyed, their memory perished.
See! The Lord is seated forever on the throne he established for judgment,
ruling the world with justice, and judging the nations with equity.
So the Lord proves a haven to the oppressed, a haven in times of trouble.
Well may they trust you who know your name, for those who seek you, you never abandon.
Sing praise to the Lord, whose home is in Zion, declare his deeds among the nations.
As avenger of blood, he keeps them in mind, he does not forget the cry of the wretched.
Show me favour, Lord, see how my foes afflict me, lift me up from the gates of death;
so I may, in your help exulting, tell forth your praise at the gates of Zion.
The nations are sunk in the pit which they made, in the net that they hid, their own foot is entangled.
The Lord is revealed in the judgment he wrought, the wicked are snared in their own handiwork. (Selah)
Let the wicked depart to Sheol, all the nations that live forgetful of God.
For the needy will not be always forgotten, nor the hope of the helpless be lost forever.
Arise, Lord; don’t let them triumph: before your face let the nations be judged.
Strike them with fear, Lord: show the nations how frail they are. (Selah)

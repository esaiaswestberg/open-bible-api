Defend me, O Lord, for my walk has been blameless; in the Lord have I trusted unswervingly:
Examine me, Lord, and test me; test my heart and my mind.
For your love is before my eyes, and your faithfulness governs my way.
I never sat down with the worthless, nor companied with dissemblers.
I hate the assembly of knaves, I would never sit down with the wicked;
but, with hands washed in innocence, I would march round your altar, O Lord,
singing loud songs of thanks, and telling of all your wonders.
O Lord, I love your house, the place where your glory lives.
Do not gather me up with sinners; slay me not with people of blood,
whose hands are stained with villainy, and whose right hand is filled with bribes.
But my walk is blameless! O redeem me, be gracious to me.
My foot stands on even ground, in the choirs I will bless the Lord.

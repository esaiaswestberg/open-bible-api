When Israel went out of Egypt, Jacob’s house from a barbarous people,
God chose Judah for himself, Israel became his kingdom.
The sea saw it, and fled, Jordan river ran backwards.
Mountains skipped like rams, hills like the young of the flock.
Why, sea, do you flee? Jordan, why run backwards?
Mountains, why skip ram-like? Why, hills, like the young of the flock?
Earth, tremble before the Lord, at the presence of Jacob’s God,
who turns rocks into pools of water, and flint into fountains of water.

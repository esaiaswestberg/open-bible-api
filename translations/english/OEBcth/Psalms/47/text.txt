Clap your hands, all you peoples: shout to God in ringing cries.
For the Lord is most high and dread, a great king over all the earth.
He subdues the peoples under us, the nations under our feet;
he chooses our heritage for us, the glory of Jacob whom he loves. (Selah)
God is gone up with a shout, the Lord with the sound of a trumpet.
Sing praise to our God, sing praises: sing praise to our king, sing praises.
For king of all earth is he: praise God in a skilful song.
God is king over all the nations, God sits on his holy throne.
Princes of nations gather with the people of Abraham’s God: for the shields of the earth are God’s; greatly exalted is he.

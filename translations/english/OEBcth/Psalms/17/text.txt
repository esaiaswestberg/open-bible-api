Listen, O Lord, to my innocence; attend to my piercing cry. Give heed to my prayer out of lips unfeigned.
Let my vindication come from you, your eyes see the truth.
When you test my heart when you visit at night, and assay me like silver --- you can find no evil. I am determined that my mouth should not lie.
I gave earnest heed to the words of your lips.
My steps have held fast to the paths of your precepts and in your tracks have my feet never stumbled.
So I call you, O God, with assurance of answer; bend down your ear to me, hear what I say.
Show your marvellous love, you who save from enemies those who take refuge at your right hand.
Keep me as the apple of the eye, hide me in the shelter of your wings.
From wicked people who do me violence, from deadly foes who crowd around me.
They have closed their hearts to pity, the words of their mouths are haughty.
Now they dog us at every step, keenly watching, to hurl us to the ground,
like a lion, longing to tear, like a young lion, lurking in secret.
Arise, Lord, face them and fell them. By your sword set me free from the wicked,
by your hand, O Lord, from those whose portion of life is this world. But let your treasured ones have food in plenty may their children be full and their children satisfied.
In my innocence I will see your face, awake I am filled with a vision of you.

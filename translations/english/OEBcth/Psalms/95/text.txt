Come! Let us ring out our joy to the Lord, let us merrily shout to our rock of salvation.
Before his face let us come with thanks, with songs of praise let us shout to him.
For the Lord is a great God, king above all gods.
In his hand are the depths of the earth, the heights of the mountains are his.
The sea is his, for he made it: the dry land was formed by his hands.
Come! Let us worship and bow on our knees to the Lord our creator.
For he is our God; and we are the people he tends, the sheep in his care.    If only you would heed his voice today:
“Do not harden your hearts as at Meribah, or at Massah, that day in the desert,
when your ancestors tempted and tried me, though they had seen my deeds.
For forty years I was filled with loathing for that generation, so I said: ‘A people with wandering hearts are they, and ignorant of my ways.’
So I solemnly swore to them in my anger, that never would they enter my place of rest.”

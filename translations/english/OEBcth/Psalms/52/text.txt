Why glory in mischief, man of power? God’s kindness is all the day.
Engulfing ruin you plot, your tongue like a razor sharpened, you practiser of deceit.
Evil, not good, you love, and falsehood, not words of truth. (Selah)
But you love all words that devour, and a tongue that is given to deceit.
But God, on his part, shall destroy you forever, grasp you and pluck you out of your tent, and root you out of the land of the living. (Selah)
Smitten with awe at the sight, the righteous shall laugh at you.
“Look” (they will say) “at the hero who did not make God his stronghold, but trusted in his great wealth and in the strength of his riches.”
But I am like a fresh olive-tree in the house of God. I trust in the kindness of God for ever and evermore.
I will render you thanks for ever for what you have done. I will tell how good you are in the presence of those who love you.

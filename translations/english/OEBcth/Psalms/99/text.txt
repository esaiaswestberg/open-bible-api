The Lord is king; let the nations tremble: he is throned upon cherubs; let earth quake.
The Lord is great in Zion, he is high over all the nations.
Let them praise your great and terrible name. Holy is he.
You are a king who loves justice, equity you have established: justice and right you have wrought for Jacob.
Exalt the Lord our God, bow down at his footstool. Holy is he.
Among his priests were Moses and Aaron, Samuel among those who called on his name. They called to the Lord, and he gave them answer.
He spoke to them in the pillar of cloud, they kept his commands and the statute he gave them.
Lord our God, you gave them answer. A God of forgiveness were you to them, who suffered their deeds to go unpunished.
Exalt the Lord our God; bow down at his holy mountain. For holy is the Lord our God.

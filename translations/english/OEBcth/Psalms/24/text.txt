The earth is the Lord’s and all that it holds, the world and those who live in it.
For he founded it on the seas, and on the floods he sustains it.
Who may ascend the hill of the Lord? Who may stand in his holy place?
The clean of hands, the pure of heart, who sets not their heart upon sinful things, nor swears with intent to deceive,
they win from the Lord a blessing: God is their champion and saviour.
Such must be those who resort to him, and seek the face of the God of Jacob. (Selah)
Lift high your heads, you gates --- Higher, you ancient doors; welcome the glorious king.
“Who is the glorious king?” “The Lord strong and heroic, the Lord heroic in battle.”
Lift high your heads, you gates --- Higher, you ancient doors; welcome the glorious king.
“Who is the glorious king?” “The Lord, the God of hosts, he is the glorious king.” (Selah)

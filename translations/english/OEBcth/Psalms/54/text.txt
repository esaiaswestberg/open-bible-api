Save me, O God, by your name, by your power secure for me justice.
Listen, O God, to my prayer, give ear to the words of my mouth.
For proud men have risen against me, and terrible men seek my life, men who do not set God before them. (Selah)
But see! God is my helper, the Lord is sustaining my life.
Let their evil fall back on my foes: cut them off in your faithfulness, Lord.
Then will I bring you glad sacrifice, praising your gracious name;
for from all distress you have saved me, and feasted my eyes on my foes.

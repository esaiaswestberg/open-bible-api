I will lift up my eyes to the mountains. O whence shall help for me come?
From the Lord comes help to me the creator of heaven and earth.
Your foot he will not let totter: he who guards you will not sleep.
The guardian of Israel will neither slumber nor sleep.
The Lord is he who guards you your shelter upon your right hand.
The sun by day shall not strike you, nor the moon by night.
From all evil the Lord will guard you, he will guard your life.
The Lord will guard your going and coming from now and for evermore.

Lord, who can be guest in your tent? Who may live on your holy mountain?
The person whose walk is blameless, whose conduct is right, whose words are true and sincere;
on whose tongue there sits no slander, who will not harm a friend,
nor cruelly insult a neighbour, who regards with contempt those rejected by God; but honours those who obey the Lord, and keeps an oath, whatever the cost,
whose money is lent without interest, who never takes a bribe to hurt the innocent.    The person who does these things will always stand firm.

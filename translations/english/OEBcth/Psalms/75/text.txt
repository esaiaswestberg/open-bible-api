“At the time I choose, I will judge fairly.
Though earth melt and all her inhabitants, it is I who keep steady her pillars.” (Selah) I say to the boasters, “Boast not “; to the wicked, “Lift not up your horn: lift not your horn on high, speak not boldly against the Rock.”    For not from east nor west, not from desert nor mountains; but God himself is the judge, humbling one and exalting another.

But I will rejoice forever, singing praise to the God of Jacob.
I will hew all the horns of the wicked, but the horns of the just shall be lifted.

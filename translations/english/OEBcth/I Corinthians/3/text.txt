But I, my friends, could not speak to you as people with spiritual insight, but only as worldly-minded — mere infants in the faith of Christ.
I fed you with milk, not with solid food, for you were not then able to take it.  No, and even now you are not able; you are still worldly.
While there exist among you jealousy and party feeling, is it not true that you are worldly, and are acting merely as other people do?
When one says ‘I follow Paul,’ and another ‘I follow Apollos,’ are not you like other people?
What, I ask, is Apollos? Or what is Paul? Servants through whom you were led to accept the faith; and that only as the Lord helped each of you.
I planted, and Apollos watered, but it was God who caused the growth.
Therefore neither the one who plants, nor the one who waters, counts for anything, but only God who causes the growth.
In this the person who plants and the person who waters are one; yet each will receive their own reward in proportion to their own labour.
For we are God’s fellow workers; you are God’s harvest field, God’s building.
In fulfilment of the charge which God had entrusted to me, I laid the foundation like a skilful master; but someone else is now building on it. Let everyone take care how they build;
for no one can lay any other foundation than the one already laid — Jesus Christ.
Whatever is used by those who build on this foundation, whether gold, silver, costly stones, wood, hay, or straw,
the quality of each man’s work will become known, for the day will make it plain; because that day is to be ushered in with fire, and the fire itself will test the quality of every man’s work.
If anyone’s work, which they have built on that foundation, still remains, they will gain a reward.
If anyone’s work is burnt up, they will suffer loss; though they themselves will escape, but only as one who has passed through fire.
Do not you know that you are God’s Temple, and that God’s Spirit has his home in you?
If any one destroys the Temple of God, God will destroy them; for the Temple of God is sacred, and so also are you.
Let no one deceive himself. If any one among you imagines that, as regards this world, they are wise, let them become a ‘fool,’ that they may become wise.
For in God’s sight this world’s wisdom is folly. Scripture tells of —  ‘One who catches the wise in their own craftiness,’
And it says again —  ‘The Lord sees how fruitless are the deliberations of the wise.’
Therefore let no one boast about people; for all things are yours —
Whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or the present, or the future — all things are yours!
But you are Christ’s and Christ is God’s.

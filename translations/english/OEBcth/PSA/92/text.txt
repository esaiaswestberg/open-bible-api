It is good to give thanks to the Lord, to sing praise to your name, O Most High,
to declare your love in the morning, and your faithfulness in the night,
with voice and a ten-stringed harp, with music that throbs on the lyre.
For you make me glad by your deeds, Lord, at the work of your hands I will ring out my joy.
How great are your works, O Lord; how deep are your thoughts!
The insensitive cannot know, nor can a fool understand,
that, though the wicked flourish like grass, and evil-doers all blossom, they will perish forever.
But you are exalted forever.
For see! Your enemies, Lord For see! Your enemies perish, all evil-doers are scattered.
But you lift me to honour, and anoint me afresh with oil.
My eyes will feast on my foes, and my ears will hear of the doom of the wicked.
The righteous will sprout like the palm, will grow like a cedar of Lebanon.
In the house of the Lord are they planted, in the courts of our God they will sprout.
They will still bear fruit in old age, all sappy and fresh will they be
So they proclaim the Lord to be just, my rock, in whom is no wrong.

God has taken his stand in the divine assembly: in the midst of the gods he holds judgment.
“How long will you crookedly judge, and favour the wicked? (Selah)
Do right by the weak and the orphan, acquit the innocent poor.
Rescue the weak and the needy, save them from the hand of the wicked.
They have neither knowledge nor insight, in darkness they walk to and fro, while the earth’s foundations totter.
It was I who appointed you gods, children of the Most High all of you.
Yet like mortals you shall surely die, you shall fall like any prince.”
Arise, O God, judge the earth, for all nations are yours by inheritance.

In your might, Lord, the king rejoices, and because of your help how exultant is he!
You have granted to him the desire of his heart, the request of his lips you have not withheld. (Selah)
You did go forth to meet him with blessing and weal, you did set on his head a crown of fine gold.
He asked you for life, you gave it --- life lasting many days, forever and ever.
Great is his glory because of your help, honour and majesty you lay upon him.
For you make him most blessed forever, with the joy of your presence you make him glad.
For the king puts ever his trust in the Lord; the Most High, in his love, will preserve him unshaken.
Your hand will reach to all your foes, and those who hate you your right hand will shatter.
You will make them like a furnace of fire, when you appear, Lord. The Lord will swallow them up in his wrath. The fire shall devour them.
You will sweep their offspring from the earth, their children from humanity.
When they scheme against you and hatch evil plots --- they will fail.
For you make them turn in flight, you aim with your bow at their faces.
Be exalted, O Lord, in your strength, to your might we will sing and make music.

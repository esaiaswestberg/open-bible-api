The declaration of Yahweh to my Lord—Sit thou at my right hand, Until I make thy foes thy footstool.
Thy sceptre of strength, will Yahweh extend out of Zion, Tread thou down, in the midst of thy foes.
Thy people, will freely offer themselves, in the day of thine army,—in the splendours of holiness, out of the womb of the dawn, To thee, [shall spring forth] the dew of thy youth.
Yahweh, hath sworn—and will not repent, Thou, [shalt be] a priest unto times age-abiding, after the manner of Melchizedek.
My Lord, on thy right hand,—hath shattered—in the day of his anger—kings;
He will judge among the nations—full of dead bodies! He hath shattered the head over a land far extended:
Of the torrent in the way, will he drink;—For this cause, will he lift up [his] head.

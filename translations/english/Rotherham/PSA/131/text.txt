O Yahweh, my heart, is not haughty, nor are mine eyes, lofty, neither have I moved among great matters, or among affairs too wonderful for me.
Surely I have soothed and silenced my soul,—like a weaned child, concerning his mother, like a weaned child, concerning myself—mine own soul.
Wait, O Israel, for Yahweh, from this time forth, even to times age-abiding.

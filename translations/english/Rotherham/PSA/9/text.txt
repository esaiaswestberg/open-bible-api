I will praise Yahweh with all my heart, I will recount all thy wonderful doings:
I will rejoice and exult in thee, I will praise in song, thy Name, O most High.
When mine enemies turned back, they stumbled and perished from before thee;
For thou hast executed my right and my cause, Thou hast sat on the throne, judging righteously:
Thou hast rebuked the nations, Thou hast destroyed the lawless one, Their name, hast thou wiped out, to times age-abiding and beyond.
O enemy! complete are the desolations, evermore,—even cities, hast thou uprooted, The memory of, them, hath perished.
But, Yahweh, unto times age-abiding, will sit, Ready for judgment, is his throne;
And, he, will judge the world in righteousness, He will minister judgment to peoples, in uprightness.
Thus be Yahweh a refuge for the crushed one, a refuge for times of destitution:
Thus let them who know thy Name, put confidence in thee, that thou hast not forsaken the searchers for thee, O Yahweh.
Sing ye praise to Yahweh, who is seated in Zion, Tell among the peoples his doings.
When he was making inquisition for blood, of them, had he remembrance, he forgat not the outcry of the oppressed.
Show me favour, O Yahweh! Behold my humiliation due to them who hate me, Lift me on high out of the gates of death;
That I may recount all thy praises, In the gates of the daughter of Zion, may exult in thy salvation.
The nations, have sunk, in the pit they had made, In the net which they had hidden, is caught their own foot.
To be known is Yahweh, by the sentence he hath executed, By the doing of his own hands, is he about to strike down the lawless one. [Resounding music. Selah.]
The lawless, shall return, to hades, all nations forgetful of God.
For, not always, shall the needy, be forgotten,—[nor,] the hope of the oppressed, perish for ever.
Rise! Yahweh! let man not prevail, let the nations be judged before thee.
Appoint, O Yahweh, a terror for them,—Let the nations know [that] they are men. [Selah.]

Be favorable unto me, O God, according to thy lovingkindness, And, in the multitude of thy compassions, blot out my transgressions;
Thoroughly wash me from mine iniquity, And, from my sin, make me pure;
For, my transgressions, do, I, acknowledge, And, my sin, is before me continually:
Against thee—against thee alone, have I sinned, And, wickedness—in thine eyes, have I done,—That thou mayest, Be justified when thou speakest,—Be clear when thou judgest.
Lo! in iniquity, was I brought forth, And, in sin, did my mother conceive me.
Lo! faithfulness, hast thou desired in the inward parts, Yea, in the hidden part, wilt thou cause me to know, wisdom.
Wilt thou cleanse me from sin with hyssop, That I may be pure? Wilt thou wash me, That I may be whiter, than snow?
Wilt thou cause me to hear joy and gladness? The bones thou hast crushed would exult.
Hide thy face from my sins,—And, all mine iniquities, blot out;
A pure heart, create for me, O God, And, a steadfast spirit, renew within me.
Do not cast me away from thy presence, And, thy Holy Spirit, do not take from me:
Restore unto me the joy of thy salvation, And, with a willing spirit, wilt thou uphold me:—
I would teach transgressors thy ways, And, sinners, unto thee, should return.
Rescue me from shed-blood, O God, the God of my salvation, My tongue should shout thy righteousness;
O My Lord! my lips, wilt thou open, And, my mouth, shall declare thy praise.
For thou wilt not desire sacrifice—that I should give it, Ascending-offering, will not please:
The sacrifices of God, are a spirit that is broken,—A heart—broken and crushed, O God, thou wilt not despise.
Do good, in thy good-pleasure, unto Zion, Wilt thou build the walls of Jerusalem!
Then, shalt thou desire the sacrifices of righteousness, Ascending-sacrifice and whole burnt-offering, Then, shall ascend upon thine altar, young bulls.

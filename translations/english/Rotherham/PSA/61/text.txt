Hear, O God, my loud cry, Attend unto my prayer:
From the end of the earth, unto thee do I cry, When my heart fainteth away, Unto a rock that is higher than I, wilt thou lead me.
For thou hast been, A Refuge to me, A Tower of Strength, from the face of the foe.
I would be a guest in thy tent to the ages, I would seek refuge in the concealment of thy wings. [Selah.]
For, thou, O God, hast hearkened to my vows, Thou hast granted a possession, unto them who revere thy Name.
Days—unto the days of the king, wilt thou add. His years, as of generation after generation:
Let him retain his seat age-abidingly before God, Appoint that, lovingkindness and faithfulness, my watch over him!
So, will I sing thy Name unto futurity, Paying my vows, day by day.

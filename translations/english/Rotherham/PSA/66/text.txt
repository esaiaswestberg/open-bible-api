Make a joyful noise unto God, all the earth;
Praise ye in song the glory of his Name, Celebrate the glory of his praise:
Say unto God—How fearful in thy doings, Through the abounding of thy power, shall thy foes come cringing unto thee;
All the earth, shall bow themselves down to thee, And sing praises unto thee,. Shall praise in song thy Name. [Selah.]
Come and see the doings of God,—Fearful in deed toward the sons of men:
He turned the sea into dry land, Through the stream, crossed they over on foot, There did we rejoice in him:
Who ruleth, in his might, unto times age abiding, His eyes, over the nations, keep watch, The rebellious, let them not exalt themselves. [Selah.]
Bless our God, O ye peoples, And cause to be heard, the sound of his praise;—
Who hath set our soul among the living, And hath not suffered, our foot, to slip.
For thou didst prove us, O God, Thou didst refine us, according to the refining of silver:
Thou didst bring us into the hunter’s net, Thou didst lay a load upon our loins;
Thou didst let men ride at our head; We went into fire and into water, But thou didst bring us forth into freedom.
I will enter thy house with ascending-sacrifices, I will pay unto thee my vows,
Which my lips uttered, And my mouth spake, in my distress.
Ascending-sacrifices of fatlings, will I cause to ascend unto thee, With the perfume of rams, I will offer bulls, with he-goats. [Selah.]
Come! hearken—that I may recount, all ye reverers of God, What he hath done for my soul:—
Unto him—with my mouth, did I cry, And high praise was under my tongue.
If, iniquity, I had cared for in my heart, My Lord, had not heard me!
But in truth, God hath heard, He hath attended to the voice of my prayer.
Blessed be God, Who hath not turned away my prayer, Nor his own lovingkindness from me.

To my words, give ear, O Yahweh, Understand thou my softly murmured prayer:
Attend to the voice of my cry, my King and my God, for, unto thee, do I pray.
O Yahweh! in the morning, shalt thou hear my voice, In the morning, will I set in order unto thee, and keep watch;
For, not a GOD finding pleasure in lawlessness, art thou, and wrong can be no guest of thine:
Boasters, shall not station themselves, before thine eyes,—Thou hatest all workers of iniquity:
Thou wilt destroy them who speak falsehood,—The man of bloodshed and of deceit, Yahweh abhorreth.
But, I, in the abounding of thy lovingkindness, will enter thy house, I will bow down towards thy holy temple, in reverence of thee:
O Yahweh! lead me in thy righteousness, because of mine adversaries, Make even, before me, thy way:
For in his mouth is nothing worthy of trust, Their inward purpose, is engulphing ruin,—An opened sepulchre, is their throat, With their tongue, speak they smooth things.
Declare them guilty, O God, Let them fall by their own counsels,—Into the throng of their own transgressions, thrust them down, For they have rebelled against thee:—
That all may rejoice who seek refuge in thee, to times age-abiding, may shout in triumph, that thou wilt protect them, and they may leap for joy in thee who are lovers of thy Name.
For, thou, wilt bless the righteous man, O Yahweh, As with an all-covering shield—with good pleasure, wilt thou encompass him.

Not unto us, O Yahweh, not unto us,—but, unto thine own Name, give glory, concerning thy lovingkindness, concerning thy faithfulness.
Wherefore should the nations say, Pray where is their God?
When, our God, is in the heavens, Whatsoever he pleased, hath he done.
Their idols, are silver and gold, the works of the hands of men,—
A mouth, have they, but they speak not, Eyes, have they, but they see not;
Ears, have they, but they hear not, A nose, have they, but they smell not:
Their hands! but they feel not Their feet! but they walk not, No sound make they in their throat.
Like unto them, shall be they who make them, Every one who trusteth in them.
O Israel! trust thou in Yahweh, Their help and their shield, is he!
O house of Aaron! trust ye in Yahweh, Their help and their shield, is he!
Ye that revere Yahweh! trust in Yahweh, Their help and their shield, is he!
Yahweh, hath remembered us, he will bless—He will bless the house of Israel, He will bless the house of Aaron;
He will bless them who revere Yahweh, the small with the great.
Yahweh multiply you, You, and your children.
Blessed are ye of Yahweh, who made the heavens and the earth:
As for the heavens, the heavens, belong to Yahweh, but the earth, hath he given to the sons of men.
The dead, cannot praise Yah, nor any that go down into silence;
But, we, will bless Yah, from henceforth even unto times age-abiding. Praise ye Yah.

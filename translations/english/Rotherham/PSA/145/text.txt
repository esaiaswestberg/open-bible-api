I will extol thee, my God, O King, and will bless thy Name, to times age-abiding and beyond:
Every day, will I bless thee, and praise thy Name, to times age-abiding and beyond.
Great is Yahweh—and worthy to be heartily praised, And, his greatness, is unsearchable.
Generation unto generation, shall celebrate thy works, and, thy mighty deeds, shall they tell:
The splendour of the glory of thy majesty, shall they speak, and, thy wonders, will I utter.
And, the might of thy terrible acts, shall men speak, and, as for thy greatness, I will recount it.
The memory of thy great goodness, shall men pour forth, and, thy righteousness, shall they shout aloud.
Gracious and compassionate, is Yahweh,—slow to anger, and of great lovingkindness.
Good is Yahweh to all, and, his tender compassions, are over all his works.
All thy works, O Yahweh, will give thanks unto thee,—and, thy men of lovingkindness, will bless thee:
The glory of thy kingdom, will they tell,—and, thy power, will they speak.
To make known to the sons of men, his mighty deeds, and the splendid glory of his kingdom.
Thy kingdom, is a kingdom of all ages,—and, thy dominion, is over generation after generation.
Yahweh is ready to uphold all who are falling, and to raise all who are laid prostrate.
The eyes of all, for thee, do wait, and, thou, givest them their food in its season.
Thou, openest thy hand, and fillest every living thing with gladness.
Righteous is Yahweh in all his ways, and kind in all his works.
Near is Yahweh to all who call upon him,—to all them who call upon him in faithfulness.
The desire of them who revere him, will he fulfil, and, their cry, will he hear, and will save them.
Yahweh preserveth all who love him, but, all the lawless, will he destroy.
The praise of Yahweh, my mouth shall speak, That all flesh may bless his holy Name, Unto times age-abiding and beyond.

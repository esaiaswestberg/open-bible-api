[Be pleased] O God, to rescue me, O Yahweh, to help me—make haste.
Let them turn pale and then at once blush, Who are seeking my life,—Let them draw back, and be confounded, Who are taking pleasure in my misfortune;
Let them turn back, on account of their own shame, Who are saying, Aha! Aha!
Let all them be glad and rejoice in thee, Yea, let them, who are seekers of thee,—say continually, God be magnified! Who are lovers of thy salvation.
But, I, being humbled and needy, O God, haste to me,—My help and my deliverer, art thou, O Yahweh do not tarry.

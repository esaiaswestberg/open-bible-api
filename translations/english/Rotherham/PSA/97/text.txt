Yahweh, hath become king, Let the earth exult, Let the multitude of coastlands rejoice.
Clouds and thick darkness, are round about him, Righteousness and justice, are the establishing of his throne.
Fire, before him, proceedeth, That it may consume, round about, his adversaries.
His lightnings, have illumined, the world, The earth, hath seen, and hath trembled;
The mountains, like wax, have melted, At the presence of Yahweh, At the presence, of the Lord of all the earth.
The heavens, have declared, his righteousness,—And all the peoples, have seen, his glory.
Let all who serve an image, be ashamed, They who boast themselves in things of nought, Bow down unto him, all ye gods.
Zion, hath heard and rejoiced, And the daughters of Judah, have exulted, Because of thy righteous decisions, O Yahweh:
For, thou, Yahweh, art Most High over all the earth, Greatly hast thou exalted thyself above all gods.
Ye lovers of Yahweh! be haters of wrong,—He preserveth the lives of his men of lovingkindness, From the hand of the lawless, will he rescue them.
Light, is sown for the righteous one, And, for the upright in heart, rejoicing:
Rejoice, ye righteous, in Yahweh, And give ye thanks, at the mention of his holiness.

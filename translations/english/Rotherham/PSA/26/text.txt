Do me justice, O Yahweh, For, I, in my blamelessness, have walked, and, in Yahweh, have I trusted, I will not waver.
Try me, O Yahweh, and prove me, Test my reins and my heart:—
For, thy lovingkindness, hath been before mine eyes, and I have walked to and fro in thy faithfulness;
I have not sat with men of deceit, nor, with dissemblers, would I enter;
I have hated the convocation of evil-doers, and, with lawless men, would I not sit;
I will bathe, in pureness, my hands,—so will I go in procession around thine altar, O Yahweh;
To sound aloud a song, and to recount all thy wonderful doings.
O Yahweh, I have loved the asylum of thy house, even the place of the habitation of thy glory!
Do not remove, with sinners, my soul, nor, with men of bloodshed, my life;
In whose hands is a plot, and, their right hand, is filled with a bribe.
But, I, in my blamelessness, will walk, Redeem me and show me favour.
My foot standeth in a level place, In the convocations, will I bless Yahweh.

How happy the man, who hath not walked in the counsel of the lawless,—and, in the way of sinners, hath not stood, and, in the seat of scoffers, hath not sat;
But, in the law of Yahweh, is his delight,—and, in his law, doth he talk with himself day and night.
So doth he become like a tree planted by streams of waters,—that yieldeth, its fruit, in its season, whose leaf, also doth not wither, and, whatsoever he doeth, prospereth.
Not so, the lawless,—but as chaff which is driven about by the wind:
For this cause, shall the lawless not stand in the judgment,—nor sinners in the assembly of the righteous.
For Yahweh doth acknowledge the way of the righteous; but, the way of the lawless, shall vanish.

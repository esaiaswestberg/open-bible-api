How happy is he whose transgression is forgiven! whose sin is pardoned!
How happy the son of earth, to whom Yahweh will not reckon iniquity! and in whose spirit is no guile!
When I kept silence, my bones became worn out, Through my groaning all the day;
For, day and night, heavy upon me, was thy hand,—Changed was my life-sap into the drought of summer. [Selah.]
My sin, would I own unto thee, and, mine iniquity, not hide, I said, I will confess my transgressions unto Yahweh, And, thou, didst forgive the iniquity of my sin. [Selah.]
For this cause, will every man of lovingkindness pray unto thee, in time to obtain,—Surely, in the overflow of many waters, unto him, shall they not reach.
Thou, art a hiding-place for me, From distress, wilt thou preserve me,—With shouts of deliverance, wilt thou compass me about. [Selah.]
I will make thee discreet, I will point out to thee the way which thou must go, I will fix upon thee mine eye.
Do not ye become like a horse, like a mule, without discernment,—With the bit and bridle of his mouth, [hast thou] to restrain him,—He will not come near unto thee.
Many pains, hath the lawless one,—But, he that trusteth in Yahweh, Lovingkindness, shall compass him about.
Rejoice in Yahweh and exult, O ye righteous, Yea, shout in triumph, all ye upright in heart!

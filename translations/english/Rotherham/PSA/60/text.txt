O God, thou hast rejected us—hast scattered us, Thou hast been angry, Wilt thou restore us?
Thou hast shaken the land—hast rent it, Heal thou the fractures thereof—for it hath tottered:
Thou hast suffered thy people to see hardship, Thou hast let them drink the wine of confusion.
Thou hadst given—to them that revere thee—a banner, to float aloft, Because of [thy] faithfulness. [Selah.]
That thy beloved ones may be delivered, Save thou with thine own right hand—and answer us.
God, hath spoken in his holiness—I will exult! I will apportion Shechem, And, the Vale of Succoth, will I measure out;
Mine, is Gilead—and mine, Manasseh, But, Ephraim, is the defence, of my head, Judah, is my commander’s staff;
Moab, is my wash-bowl, Upon Edom, will I throw my shoe, Over Philistia! raise shout of triumph.
Who will conduct me to a fortified city? Who will lead me as far as Edom!
Is it not, thou, O God?—thou hast rejected us! And wilt thou not go forth, O God, with our hosts?
Grant us help out of distress, For, vain, is the deliverance of man:
In God, we shall do valiantly, He himself, therefore, will tread down our adversaries.

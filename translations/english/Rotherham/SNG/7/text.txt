How beautiful, are thy feet in sandals, O daughter of a noble,—The curvings of thy hips, are like ornaments wrought by the hands of a skilled workman:
Thy navel, is a round bowl, may it not lack spiced wine! Thy body, a heap of wheat fenced about with lilies;
Thy two breasts, are like two young roes, the twins of a gazelle:
Thy neck, is like a tower of ivory,—Thine eyes, are pools in Heshbon, by the gate of Bath-rabbim, Thy nose, is like the tower of Lebanon, which looketh towards Damascus:
Thy head upon thee, is like Carmel, And, the hair of thy head, is like purple,—The king, is held captive by the ringlets!
[HE] How beautiful, and how delightful, O dear love, for delights:
This thy stature, is like to a palm-tree, and, thy breasts, are like clusters:
I said, I will ascend the palm-tree, I will lay hold of its fruit stalks—Oh then, let thy breasts, I pray thee, be like vine-clusters, And, the fragrance of thy nose, like apples;
And, thy mouth, like good wine—[SHE] Flowing to my beloved smoothly, gliding over the lips of the sleeping.
I, am my beloved’s, and, unto me, is his longing.
Come, my beloved, Let us go forth into the country, Let us stay the night in the villages:
Let us get up early to the vineyards, Let us see whether the vine, hath burst forth, the blossom, hath opened, the pomegranates, have bloomed,—There, will I give my caresses to thee.
The love-apples, have given fragrance, and, at our openings, are all precious things, new and yet old,—O my beloved! I have treasured them up for thee.

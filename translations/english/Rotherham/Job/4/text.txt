Then responded Eliphaz the Temanite, and said:—
If one attempt a word unto thee, wilt thou be impatient? But, to restrain speech, who, can endure?
Lo! thou hast admonished many, and, slack hands, hast thou been wont to uphold:
Him that was stumbling, have thy words raised up, and, sinking knees, hast thou strengthened.
But, now, it cometh upon thee, and thou despairest, It smiteth even thee, and thou art dismayed.
Is not, thy reverence, thy confidence? And is not, thy hope, the very integrity of thy ways?
Remember, I pray thee, who, being innocent, hath perished, or when, the upright, have been cut off.
So far as I have seen, They who plow for iniquity and sow misery, reap the same:
By the blast of GOD, they perish, And, by the breath of his nostrils, are they consumed:
[Notwithstanding] the roaring of the lion, and the noise of the howling lion, yet, the teeth of the fierce lions, are broken:
The strong lion perishing for lack of prey, Even the whelps of the lioness, are scattered.
But, unto me, something was brought by stealth,—and mine ear caught a whispering of the same:
When there were thoughts, from visions of the night,—When deep sleep falleth upon men,
Dread, came upon me, and trembling, The multitude of my bones, it put in dread:
Then, a spirit, over my face, floated along, The hair of my flesh bristled-up:
It stood still, but I could not distinguish its appearance, I looked, but there was no form before mine eyes,—A whispering voice, I heard:—
Shall, mortal man, be more just than GOD? Or a man be more pure than, his Maker?
Lo! in his own servants, he trusteth not, and, his own messengers, he chargeth with error:
How much more the dwellers in houses of clay, which, in the dust, have their foundation, which are crushed sooner than a moth:
Betwixt morning and evening, are they broken in pieces, With none to save, they utterly perish:
Is not their tent-rope within them, torn away? They die, disrobed of wisdom!

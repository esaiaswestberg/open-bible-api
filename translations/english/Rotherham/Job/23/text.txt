Then responded Job, and said:—
Even to-day, is my complaint rebellion? His hand, is heavier than my groaning.
Oh that I knew where I might find him! I would come even unto his dwelling-place;
I would set out, before him, a plea, and, my mouth, would I fill with arguments;
I would note the words wherewith he would respond to me, and would mark what he would say to me.
Would he, with fulness of might, contend with me? Nay, surely, he, would give heed to me!
There an upright man, might reason with him, so should I deliver myself completely from my judge.
Behold! eastward, I go, but he is not there, and, westward, but I perceive him not;
On the north, where he worketh, but I get no vision, He hideth himself on the south that I cannot see him.
But, he, knoweth the way that I choose, Having tried me, as gold, I shall come forth.
Of his steps, my foot taketh hold, His way, have I kept, and not swerved;
The command of his lips, and would not go back, and, in my bosom, have I treasured the words of his lips.
But, he, is one, and who can turn him? What his soul desired, he hath done.
Surely he will accomplish what is decreed for me, and, many such things, hath he in store.
For this cause, from his presence, am I driven in fear, I diligently consider and am kept back from him in dread:
Yea, GOD, hath made timid my heart, and, the Almighty, hath put me in terror.
Because I was not cut off before the darkness, nor, before my face, did the gloom form a shroud.

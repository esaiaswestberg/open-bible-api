Then responded Job, and said:—
How hast thou given help to one of no-strength? given victory to an arm of no-power?
How hast thou given counsel to one of no-wisdom? or, effective wisdom, abundantly made known?
Whom hast thou taught speech? Whose inspiration hath come from thee?
The shades, tremble, beneath the waters and their inhabitants;
Naked is hades before him, and there is no covering to destruction;
Who stretcheth out the north over emptiness, hangeth the earth upon nothingness;
Who bindeth up the waters in his thick clouds, and the cloud is not rent beneath them;
Who shutteth-in the face of the throne, he spreadeth over it his cloud;
A, boundary, hath he encircled on the face of the waters, as far as where light ends in darkness;
The pillars of the heavens, are shaken, and are terrified at his rebuke:
By his strength, hath he excited the sea, and, by his skill, hath he shattered the Crocodile:
By his spirit, hath he arched the heavens, His hand hath pierced the fleeing serpent.
Lo! these, are the fringes of his way, and what a whisper of a word hath been heard of him! But, the thunder of his might, who could understand?

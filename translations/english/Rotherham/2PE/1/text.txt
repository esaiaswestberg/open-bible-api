Simon Peter, servant and apostle of Jesus Christ, unto them who have obtained, equally precious, faith, with us, in the righteousness of our God, and Saviour Jesus Christ,
Favour unto you, and peace, be multiplied, in the personal knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord;—
As, all things, suited for life and godliness his divine power, unto us, hath given, through the personal knowledge of him that hath called us through glory and excellence,—
Through which, his precious, and very great, promises, have, unto us, been given, in order that, through these, ye might become sharers in a divine nature—escaping the corruption that is in the world by coveting.
And, for this very reason also—adding, on your part, all diligence, supply, in your faith, excellence, and, in your excellence, knowledge,
And, in your knowledge, self-control, and, in your self-control, endurance, and, in your endurance, godliness,
And, in your godliness, brotherly affection, and, in your brotherly affection, love.
These things, unto you, belonging and abounding, neither idle nor unfruitful, constitute you, regarding the personal knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ;
For, he to whom these things are not present, is, blind, seeing only what is near, having come, to forget, his purification from his old sins.
Wherefore, all the more, brethren, give diligence to be making, firm, your calling and election; for, these things, doing, in nowise shall ye stumble at any time,
For, thus, shall richly be further supplied unto you—the entrance into the age-abiding kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.
Wherefore, I shall be certain to be, always, putting you in remembrance concerning these things,—although, indeed, ye know them, and have become confirmed in the present truth;
Right, nevertheless, I account it—as long as I am in this tent, to be stirring you up by putting you in remembrance,
Knowing that, speedy, is the putting off of my tent—even as, our Lord Jesus Christ also, made clear to me:
Yea, I will give diligence also, that, at every time, ye may be able, after my own departure, to be keeping up the remembrance of, these very things.
For, not as having followed, cleverly devised stories, made we known unto you the power and presence of our Lord Jesus Christ, but as having been made, spectators, of his majesty.
For, when he received from God the Father honour and glory, a voice, being borne to him such as this, by the magnificent glory—My Son, the beloved, is, this, in whom, I, delight,
Even this voice, we, heard, when, out of heaven, it was borne, we being, with him, in the holy mount.
And we have, more firm, the prophetic word;—whereunto ye are doing, well, to take heed,—as unto a lamp shining in a dusky place,—until, day, shall dawn, and, a day-star, shall arise in your hearts:—
Of this, first, taking note—that, no prophecy of scripture, becometh, self-solving;
For not, by will of man, was prophecy brought in, at any time, but, as, by Holy Spirit, they were borne along, spake, men, from God.

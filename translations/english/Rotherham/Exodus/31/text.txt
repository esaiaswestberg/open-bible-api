Then spake Yahweh unto Moses, saying:
See, I have called by name, Bezaleel, son of Uri, son of Hur of the tribe of Judah;
and have filled him with the Spirit of God, in wisdom and in understanding, and in knowledge and in all manner of workmanship;
to devise skilful designs, to work in gold and in silver, and in bronze;
and in the cutting of stones for setting, and in the carving of wood,—to work in all manner of workmanship,

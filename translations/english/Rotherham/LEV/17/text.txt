And Yahweh spake unto Moses saying:—
Speak unto Aaron, and unto his sons and unto all the sons of Israel, and thou shalt say unto them,—This, is the thing which Yahweh hath commanded, saying:
What man soever, there be of the house of Israel, who slayeth an ox or lamb or goat, in the camp,—or who slayeth it outside the camp;
and, unto the entrance of the tent of meeting, bringeth it not in, to present it as an oblation unto Yahweh, before the habitation of Yahweh, blood, shall be imputed to that man—blood, hath he shed, therefore shall that man be cut off from the midst of his people:
to the end that the sons of Israel may bring in their sacrifices which they are offering upon the face of the field, that they may bring them in unto Yahweh—unto the entrance of the tent of meeting, unto the priest,—and that so as peace-offerings unto Yahweh, they may offer them.
Then shall the priest dash the blood against the altar of Yahweh, at the entrance of the tent of meeting,—and shall make a perfume of the fat, as a satisfying odour unto Yahweh;
so shall they no more offer their sacrifices unto demons after whom they are unchastely going away,—a statute age-abiding, shall this be to them unto their generations.
Wherefore, unto them, shalt thou say: What man soever, there may be of the house of Israel, or of the sojourners that sojourn in their midst,—who causeth to go up an ascending-offering, or a sacrifice;
and unto the entrance of the tent of meeting, doth not bring it in, to offer it unto Yahweh, then shall that man be cut off from among his kinsfolk.
And, what man soever, there may be of the house of Israel, or of the sojourners that sojourn in their midst, that partaketh of any manner of blood, then will I set my face against the person that partaketh of the blood, and will cut him off from the midst of his people.
For as for the life of the flesh, in the blood, it is, therefore have, I, given it unto you upon the altar, to put a propitiatory-covering over your lives,—for the blood, it is, which, by virtue of the life, maketh propitiation.
For this cause, have I said unto the sons of Israel, Not a person from among you shall partake of blood,—Even the sojourner that sojourneth in your midst, shall not partake of blood.
And, what man soever, there may be of the sons of Israel, or of the sojourners that sojourn in their midst, who taketh by hunting any wild-beast or bird that may be eaten, then shall he pour out the blood thereof, and cover it with dust;
for, as for the life of all flesh, the blood thereof, for the life thereof, standeth, therefore have I said unto the sons of Israel—Of the blood of no manner of flesh, shall ye partake, For, the life of all flesh is the blood thereof; whoso partaketh thereof, shall be cut off.
And, in the case of any person who eateth that which died of itself or was torn in pieces, whether he be home-born, or a sojourner, then shall he wash his clothes, and bathe in water, and be unclean until the evening, and then be clean.
But, if he wash them not, and his flesh, he do not bathe, then shall he bear his iniquity.

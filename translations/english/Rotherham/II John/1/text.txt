The Elder, unto an elect lady and her children, whom I love in truth; and not, I, alone, but all those also who understand the truth,—
For the sake of the truth that abideth in us, and, with us, shall be unto times age-abiding,
Favour, mercy, peace shall be with us, from God the Father, and from Jesus Christ the Son of the Father, in truth and love.
I rejoiced exceedingly, in that I had found, from among thy children, such as were walking in truth, even as, a commandment, we received from the Father.
And, now, I request thee, lady, not as writing, a new commandment, unto thee, but one which we were holding from the beginning—That we should be loving one another.
And, this, is love, that we should be walking according to his commandments: This, is, the commandment, even as ye heard from the beginning, that, therein, ye should be walking.
Because, many deceivers, have gone out into the world, they who do not confess Jesus Christ coming in flesh: This, is the deceiver and the antichrist.
Be taking heed unto yourselves, lest ye lose what things we earned,—but, a full reward, ye may duly receive.
Every one that taketh a lead, and abideth not in the teaching of Christ, hath not, God: he that abideth in the teaching, the same, hath, both the Father and the Son.
If anyone cometh unto you and, this teaching, doth not bring, be not receiving him home, and, Joy to thee! do not say;
For, he that biddeth him rejoice, hath fellowship with his wicked works.
Though I had many things, unto you, to write, I was not minded [to say them] with paper and ink; but I hope to come unto you, and, mouth to mouth, to talk,—that your joy may be made full.
The children of thy chosen sister salute thee.

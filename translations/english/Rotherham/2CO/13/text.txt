This third time, am I coming unto you:—at the mouth of two witnesses, or three, shall every matter be established.
I have said beforehand, and do say beforehand,—as present the second time, although now absent, unto them who before sinned, and unto all the rest,—that, if I come again, I will not spare.
Since, a test, ye are seeking, of the speaking in me of Christ;—who, unto you, is not weak, but is powerful in you,—
For, although he was crucified through weakness, yet is he living through God’s power,—for, although, we, are weak in him, yet shall we live with him, through God’s power [unto us]—
Be trying, yourselves, whether ye are in the faith, be putting, yourselves, to the test! Or do ye not recognise yourselves, seeing that, Jesus Christ, is in you,—unless perhaps ye fail in the testing.
I hope, however, that ye shall come to know, that, we, fail not in the testing!
But we pray unto God, that ye may do nothing base,—not that, we, may appear, accepted, but that, ye, the honourable thing, may be doing, even though, we, should be, as it were, rejected;
For we can do nothing against the truth, but for the truth;
For we rejoice—whensoever, we, are weak, and, ye, are, strong. This, also we pray for—your restoration:—
For this cause, these things, while absent, am I writing, that I may not, when present, deal sharply—according to the authority which, the Lord, hath given me, for building up and not for pulling down.
Finally, brethren, farewell! Be getting restored, be taking encouragement, be of one mind, live in peace,—and, the God of love and peace, will be with you.
Salute ye one another with a holy kiss.
All the saints, salute you.
The favour of our Lord Jesus [Christ], and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit, be with you all.

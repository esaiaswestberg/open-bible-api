For this cause, I, Paul, the prisoner of Christ Jesus in behalf of you the nations:—
If at least ye have heard of the administration of the favour of God which hath been given unto me for you,
[How that], by way of revelation, was made known unto me the sacred secret,—even as I before wrote in brief,—
Respecting which ye can, by reading, perceive my discernment in the sacred secret of the Christ,—
Which, in other generations, had not been made known unto the sons of men, as it hath, now, been revealed by his holy apostles and prophets, in Spirit;—
That they who are of the nations should be joint heirs, and a joint body, and joint partakers of the promise in Christ Jesus through means of the glad-message,—
Of which I was made a minister, according to the free-gift of the favour of God which was given unto me, according to the energy of his power:
Unto me—the less than least of all saints, was given this favour, unto the nations, to announce the glad-message of the untraceable riches of the Christ,
And to bring to light—what is the administration of the sacred secret which had been hidden away from the ages in God, who did all things create:
In order that now, unto the principalities and the authorities in the heavenlies, might be made known, through means of the assembly, the manifold wisdom of God,—
According to a plan of the ages which he made in the anointed Jesus our Lord,—
In whom we have our freedom of speech and introduction with assurance, through the faith of him;—
Wherefore I request, that there be no fainting in my tribulations in your behalf, the which is your glory;—
For this cause, I bow my knees unto the Father,—
From whom every fatherhood in [the] heavens and upon the earth is named,—
In order that he may give unto you—according to his glorious riches, with power, to be strengthened, through his Spirit, in the inner man,
That the Christ may dwell, through means of your faith, in your hearts, in love, having become rooted and founded,
In order that ye may be mighty enough to grasp firmly, with all the saints,—what is the breadth and length and depth and height,
To get to know, also, the knowledge-surpassing, love of the Christ,—in order that ye may be filled unto all the fulness of God:
Now, unto him who is able to do, above all things, exceeding abundantly above the things which we ask or conceive,—according to the power which doth energise itself within us,—
Unto him, be the glory, in the assembly, and in Christ Jesus—unto all the generations of the age of ages; Amen:—

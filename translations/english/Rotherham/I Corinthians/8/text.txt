Now, concerning the idol-sacrifices, we are aware—because we, all, have knowledge,—knowledge, puffeth up, but, love, buildeth up;
If anyone thinketh that he knoweth anything, not yet knoweth he, as he must needs come to know,
But, if anyone loveth God, the same, is known of him—
Concerning, then, the eating of idol-sacrifices, we are aware—that an idol is, nothing, in the world, and that, none, is God save one.
For, if indeed there are so-called gods, whether in heaven or upon earth,—as indeed there are gods many and lords many,
[Yet], to us, there is one God the Father, of whom are all things, and, we, for him; and one Lord Jesus Christ, through whom are all things, and, we, through him.
Howbeit, not in all, is the knowledge; but, some, by their familiarity, until even now, with the idol, as an idol-sacrifice, eat it, and, their conscience, being, weak, is defiled.
Food, indeed, will not commend us unto God,—neither, if we eat not, do we lack, nor, if we eat, do we abound.
But be taking heed, lest, by any means, your right, itself, become, an occasion of stumbling, unto the weak;
For, if anyone should see [thee] who hast knowledge, in an idol-temple, reclining, will not, his conscience, being, weak, be built up for the eating of the idol-sacrifices?
In fact, he that is weak, is being destroyed, by thy knowledge—the brother for whose sake Christ died.
But, in thus sinning against the brethren am wounding their conscience, seeing it is weak, against Christ, are ye sinning.
Therefore, if food is an occasion of stumbling unto my brother, in nowise will I eat flesh unto the age that abideth,—that, I may not occasion, my brother, to stumble.

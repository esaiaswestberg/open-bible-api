Cast thy bread-corn, upon the face of the waters,—for, after many days, shalt thou find it:
Give a portion to seven, yea even to eight,—for thou canst not know, what there shall be of misfortune, upon the earth.
If the clouds be filled with a downpour, upon the earth, will they empty themselves, and, if a tree fall in the south or in the north, in the place where the tree falleth, there will it be found.
He that observeth the wind, will not sow,—and, he that watcheth the clouds, will not reap.
Just as thou knowest not what is the way of the spirit, when the body is in the womb of her that is with child, even, so, canst thou not know the work of God, who maketh all.
In the morning, sow thy seed, and, until evening, do not withhold thy hand,—for thou knowest not—whether shall thrive, either this or that, or whether, both alike, shall be fruitful.
Truly sweet is the light,—and, pleasant to the eyes, to see the sun:
But, though, many years, a man live, through them all, let him rejoice; yet let him remember the days of darkness, for many they may be, all that cometh, may be vanity.
Rejoice, O young man, in thy youth, and let thy heart gladden thee in the days of thine early manhood, and walk thou—in the ways of thine own heart, and in that which is seen by thine own eyes,—yet know, that, for all these things, will God bring thee into judgment.
Therefore remove thou vexation from thy heart, and put away discomfort from thy flesh,—for, youth and dawn, are vanity!

In the first year of Cyrus, king of Persia, to fulfil the word of Yahweh from the mouth of Jeremiah, Yahweh aroused the spirit of Cyrus, king of Persia, and he made a proclamation throughout all his kingdom, moreover also in writing, saying:
Thus, saith Cyrus, king of Persia, All the kingdoms of the earth, hath Yahweh God of the heavens, given to me,—and, he himself, hath laid charge upon me, to build for him a house, in Jerusalem, which is in Judah.
Who is there among you of all his people? His God be with him, and let him go up to Jerusalem, which is in Judah,—and build the house of Yahweh God of Israel, (he, is God!) which is in Jerusalem;
And, whosoever is left, of all the places where he doth sojourn, let the men of his place uphold him, with silver and with gold, and with goods and with beasts,—along with a voluntary offering for the house of God, which is in Jerusalem.
Then arose the ancestral chiefs of Judah and Benjamin, and the priests, and the Levites,—even every one whose spirit God had aroused, to go up to build the house of Yahweh, which was in Jerusalem;
and, all they who were round about them, strengthened their hands, with utensils of silver, with gold with goods and with beasts, and with precious things,—besides any thing he had volunteered.
And, King Cyrus, brought forth the utensils of the house of Yahweh,—which Nebuchadnezzar had brought forth from Jerusalem, and put in the house of his gods:—
yea Cyrus king of Persia brought them forth, by the hand of Mithredath the treasurer,—and numbered them unto Sheshbazzar, a leader of Judah.
And, these, were the numbers of them,—basins of gold, thirty, basins of silver, a thousand, knives, twenty-nine;
bowls of gold, thirty, bowls of silver, of a secondary sort, four hundred and ten,—other utensils, a thousand.
All the utensils, in gold and silver, were five thousand and four hundred,—the whole, did Sheshbazzar bring up with the upbringing of the exile, out of Babylon unto Jerusalem.

Then came the word of Yahweh unto Jonah, the second time, saying:
Arise, get thee unto Nineveh, the great city,—and cry against it the cry that I am bidding thee.
So Jonah arose, and went his way unto Nineveh, according to the word of Yahweh,—Nineveh, being a city great before God, of three days’ journey.
So Jonah began to enter into the city, one day’s journey,—and he cried out and said—Yet forty days, and, Nineveh, is to be overthrown!
And the people of Nineveh believed in God,—and proclaimed a fast, and clothed themselves in sackcloth, from the greatest of them, even unto the least of them.
And the word reached unto the king of Nineveh, so he arose from his throne, and laid aside his robe from off him,—and covered him with sackcloth, and sat on ashes.
And he caused an outcry to be made—and said—throughout Nineveh, By decree of the king and of his great men, Be it known:—Man and beast, herd and flock, Let them taste, nothing, let them not feed, and, water, let them not drink:
Let both man and beast, cover themselves with sackcloth, and let them cry unto God, mightily,—Yea let them turn, every man from his wicked way, and from the violence which is in their hands:
Who knoweth whether God himself—may turn and grieve,—and turn away from the glow of his anger, that we perish not?
And God saw their doings, that they turned from their wicked way,—and God was grieved over the calamity which he had spoken of executing upon them, and executed it not.

Then prayed Jonah, unto Yahweh, his God,—out of the belly of the fish;
and said—I cried—out of my distress—unto Yahweh, and he answered me,—Out of the belly of hades, called I, Thou didst hear my voice.
For thou hast cast me into the deep, into the heart of the seas, and, a flood, enveloped me,—All thy breakers and thy rolling waves, over me, passed.
And, I, said, I am driven out from before thine eyes,—Yet will I again have regard unto thy holy temple:
The waters, encompassed me, to the peril of my life, The roaring deep, enveloped me,—The sea-weed, was wrapped about my head:
To the roots of the mountains, went I down, As for the earth, her bars, were about me, age-abidingly,—Then didst thou bring up—out of the pit—my life, O Yahweh my God.
When my soul, darkened itself over me, Yahweh, I remembered,—and my prayer, came in unto thee, unto thy holy temple.
They who take heed to the vanities of falsehood, do, their own lovingkindness, forsake.
But, I, with the voice of praise, will sacrifice unto thee, What I have vowed, I will pay,—Salvation, belongeth to Yahweh!
So then Yahweh spake unto the fish,—and it vomited out Jonah, upon the dry land.

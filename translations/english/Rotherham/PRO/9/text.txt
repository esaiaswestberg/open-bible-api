Wisdom, hath builded her house, hath hewn out her seven pillars;
hath slaughtered her beasts, hath mingled her wine, hath even set in order her table;
hath sent forth her maidens, She crieth aloud, upon the tops of the heights of the city:
Whoso is simple, let him turn in hither, as for him that lacketh sense, she saith to him—
Come, feed on my food, and drink of the wine I have mingled;
Forsake the simple ones, and live, and advance in the way of understanding.
He that rebuketh a scoffer, getteth to himself contempt, and, he that reproveth a lawless man, [getteth to himself] his shame.
Do not reprove a scoffer, lest he hate thee, Reprove a wise man, and he will love thee.
Give to a wise man, and he will be wiser still, Inform a righteous man, and he will increase learning.
The beginning of wisdom, is the reverence of Yahweh, and, the knowledge of the Holy, is understanding;
For, by me, shall be multiplied—thy days, and there be added to thee—the years of life.
If thou art wise, thou art wise for thyself, but, if thou scoff, alone, shalt thou bear it.
The woman Stupidity, is boisterous, so simple that she knoweth not what she would do;
So she sitteth at the entrance of her house, upon a seat, in the heights of the city;
To invite them who pass by the way, who are going straight on in their paths:
Whoso is simple, let him turn aside hither, and, as for him that lacketh sense, she saith to him:
Stolen waters, will be sweet,—and a secret meal, will be pleasant;
But he knoweth not, that the shades are there; In the depths of hades, are her guests.

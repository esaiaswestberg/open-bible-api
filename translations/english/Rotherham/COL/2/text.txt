For I desire you to know, how great a contest I am having—in behalf of you, and of those in Laodicea, and as many as have not seen my face in the flesh;
In order that their hearts may be encouraged, being knit together in love, even unto all the riches of the full assurance of their understanding, unto a personal knowledge of the sacred secret of God,—Christ:
In whom are all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge hidden away.
This I say, in order that, no one, may be reasoning, you, aside with plausible discourse;
For, though, indeed, in the flesh, I am absent, yet, in the spirit, with you, I am—rejoicing, and beholding your order and the solid firmness of your Christ-ward faith.
As therefore ye have accepted the Anointed Jesus as your Lord, in him, be walking,—
Rooted, and being built up, in him, and making yourselves sure in your faith, even as ye have been taught,—surpassing therein with thanksgiving.
Be taking heed, lest there shall be anyone leading, you, off as a spoil, through means of their philosophy, and an empty deceit,—according to the instruction of men, according to the first principles of the world,—and not according to Christ:
Because, in him, dwelleth all the fullness of the Godhead, bodily,
And ye are, in him, filled full,—Who, is the head of all principality and authority,
In whom, ye have also been circumcised with a circumcision not done by hand, in the despoiling of the body of flesh, in the circumcision of the Christ,—
Having been buried together with him in your immersion, wherein also ye have been raised together, through your faith in the energising of God—Who raised him from among the dead.
And, as for you—who were, dead, by your offences and by the uncircumcision of your flesh, he hath brought you to life together with him,—having in favour forgiven us all our offences,
Having blotted out the handwriting against us by the decrees, which was hostile to us,—and hath taken away, the same, out of the midst, nailing it up to the cross:
Spoiling the principalities and the authorities, he made of them an open example, celebrating a triumph over them thereby.
Let no one, therefore, be judging, you,—in eating and in drinking, or in respect of feast, or new moon, or sabbath,—
Which are a shadow of the things to come, whereas, the body, is of the Christ.
Let, no one, against you, be arbitrating, however wishful,—in respect of lowliness of mind, and of a religious observance of the messengers: upon what things he hath seen, taking his stand, in vain, puffed up by his carnal mind,—
And not holding fast the head: from which, all the body, through means of its joints and uniting bands, receiving supply, and connecting itself together, groweth with the growth of God.
If ye have died, together with Christ, from the first principles of the world, why, as though alive in the world, are ye submitting to decrees,—
Do not handle, nor taste, nor touch;—
Which things are all for decay in the using up;—according to the commandments and teachings of men?
The which things, indeed, though they have, an appearance, of wisdom, in self-devised religious observance, and lowliness of mind, [and] ill-treatment of body, are, in no honourable way, unto a satisfying of the flesh.

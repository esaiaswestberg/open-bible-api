And Yahweh spake unto Moses, saying:
Speak unto the sons of Israel, saying, A woman when she conceiveth seed and giveth birth to a male child, then shall she be unclean seven days, according to the days of her removal in her sickness shall she be unclean.
And, on the eighth day, shall the flesh of his foreskin be circumcised.
And, for thirty-three days, shall she continue in the blood of purification,—no hallowed thing, shall she touch, and, into the sanctuary, shall she not enter, until her days of purification are fulfilled.
But if, a female child, she bear, then shall she be unclean two weeks as in her removal,—and, for sixty-six days, shall she continue in the blood of purification.
And, when the days of her purification are fulfilled, whether for a son or for a daughter, she shall bring in a lamb, the choice of its year, as an ascending-sacrifice, and a young pigeon or a turtle-dove, as a sin-bearer, unto the entrance of the tent of meeting, unto the priest;
and he shall bring it near before Yahweh so shall the priest put a propitiatory-covering over her, and she shall be clean from her fountain of blood. This, is the law for her that hath given birth, to a male child or to a female.
But, if her hand findeth not sufficiency for a lamb, then shall she take two turtle doves or two young pigeons, one for an ascending-sacrifice and one for a sin-bearer,—so shall the priest put a propitiatory-covering over her, and she shall be clean.

Thou shalt say, therefore, in that day, I will praise thee, O Yahweh! Though thou hast been angry with me, Thine anger turneth back. And thou dost comfort me.
Lo, GOD is my salvation! I will trust and not dread,—For, my might and melody, is Yah, Yahweh, And he hath become mine, by salvation.
Therefore shall ye draw water, with rejoicing,—out of the fountains of salvation.
And ye shall say in that day, Praise Yahweh. Call upon his Name, Make known among the peoples, his doings,—Bring to remembrance that, exalted, is his Name!
Praise in song Yahweh, For a splendid thing, hath he done,—Well known, is this in all the earth.
Make shrill thy voice and sing out thou inhabitress of Zion,—That great in the midst of thee, is the Holy One of Israel.

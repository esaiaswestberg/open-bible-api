Now, Joshua, was old, advanced in days,—so then Yahweh said unto him—Thou, art old, advanced in days, and, much the larger part of the land, remaineth to be possessed.
This, is the land that remaineth,—all the regions of the Philistines, and all the Geshuri;
from the Shihor which faceth Egypt, even as far as the boundary of Ekron, northward, to the Canaanites, is it counted,—five princes of Philistines, the Gazites, and the Ashdodites, the Ashkalonites, the Gittites, and the Ekronites, also the Avvim
on the south: all the land of the Canaanites, and Mearah which belongeth to the Zidonians, as far as Aphek,—as far as the boundary of the Amorites;
and the land of the Gebalites, and all the Lebanon, to the rising of the sun, from Baal-gad, under Mount Hermon,—as far as the entering in of Hamath:
all the inhabitants of the hill country, from the Lebanon as far as Misrephoth-maim—all the Zidonians, I myself, will dispossess them from before the sons of Israel,—nevertheless, assign thou it by lot unto Israel, for an inheritance, as I have commanded thee.
Now, therefore, apportion this land as an inheritance, unto the nine tribes,—and the half tribe of Manasseh.
With them, the, Reubenites and the Gadites, received their inheritance,—which Moses gave them beyond the Jordan, eastward, as Moses the servant of Yahweh gave unto them:
from Aroer, which is on the edge of the ravine of Arnon, and the city, which is in the midst of the ravine, and all the table-land of Medeba, as far as Dibon;
and all the cities of Sihon, king of the Amorites, who reigned in Heshbon,—as far as the boundary of the sons of Ammon;
and Gilead, and the boundary of the Geshurites and the Maacathites, and all Mount Hermon, and all Bashan, as far as Salecah;
all the kingdom of Og, in Bashan, who reigned in Ashtaroth and in Edrei,—he, being left of the remnant of the giants; and Moses smote them and dispossessed them;
the sons of Israel, however, did not dispossess, the Geshurites or the Maacathites,—but Geshur and Maacath have remained in the midst of Israel until this day.
Howbeit, unto the tribe of Levi, gave he no inheritance,—the altar-flames of Yahweh God of Israel, are his inheritance, as he spake unto him.
Thus then Moses gave [an inheritance] unto the tribe of the sons of Reuben by their families;
and their boundary was from Aroer, that is on the edge of the ravine of Arnon and the city which is in the midst of the ravine and all the table-land by Medeba;
Heshbon and all her cities which are on the table-land,—Dibon and Bamoth-baal, and Beth-baal-meon;
and Jahaz and Kedemoth and Maphaath;
and Kiriathaim and Sibmah, and Zareth-shahar on the mount of the vale;
and Beth-peor, and the slopes of Pisgah, and Beth-jeshimoth;
and all the cities of the table-land, and all the kingdom of Sihon king of the Amorites, who reigned in Heshbon,—whom Moses smote—with the princes of Midian, Evi and Rekem and Zur and Hur and Reba, dukes of Sihon dwelling in the land;
Balaam also son of Beor, the diviner, did the sons of Israel slay with the sword among their slain.
And so the boundary of the sons of Reuben was the Jordan and district. This, is the inheritance of the sons of Reuben by their families, the cities and the villages thereof.
And Moses gave [an inheritance] unto the tribe of Gad, unto the sons of Gad by their families;
and their boundary was—Jazer, and all the cities of Gilead, and half the land of the sons of Ammon,—as far as Aroer, which faceth Rabbah;
and from Heshbon as far as Ramath-mizpeh, and Botonim,—and from Mahanaim as far as the boundary of Debir;
and in the valley—Beth-haram and Beth-nimrah and Succoth and Zaphon, the rest of the kingdom of Sihon king of Heshbon, the Jordan and district,—as far as the end of the sea of Chinnereth, beyond the Jordan eastward.
This, is the inheritance of the sons of Gad, by their families,—the cities and the villages thereof.
And Moses gave [an inheritance] unto the half tribe of Manasseh,—so it belonged to the half tribe of the sons of Manasseh by their families;
and their boundary was—from Mahanaim all Bashan all the kingdom of Og king of Bashan and all the Encampments of Jair which are in Bashan three-score cities;
and, half Gilead and Ashtaroth and Edrei, cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan, pertained to the sons of Machir son of Manasseh, to half the sons of Machir by their families.
These, are [the portions] which Moses gave for inheritance, in the waste plains of Moab,—over the Jordan by Jericho eastward.
But, unto the tribe of Levi, Moses gave no inheritance,—Yahweh God of Israel, he, was their inheritance, as he spake unto them.

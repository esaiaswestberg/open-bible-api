Paul and Silvanus and Timothy—unto the assembly of Thessalonians, in God our Father and Lord Jesus Christ,—
Favour unto you, and peace, from God [our] Father and Lord Jesus Christ.
We are bound, to be giving thanks, unto God, continually, concerning you, brethren, even as it is, meet; because your faith groweth exceedingly, and the love of each one of you all one to another aboundeth,
So that, we ourselves, in you, are boasting, in the assemblies of God, over your endurance and faith in all your persecutions and tribulations which ye are sustaining:—
A proof of the righteous judgment of God, to the end ye may be counted worthy of the kingdom of God, in behalf of which ye are also suffering:—
If, at least, it is a, righteous thing with God, to recompense, affliction, unto them that afflict you,
And, unto you that are afflicted, release, with us,—by the revealing of the Lord Jesus from heaven, with his messengers of power,
In a fiery flame; holding forth vengeance—against them that refuse to know God, and them who decline to hearken unto the glad-message of our Lord Jesus,
Who, indeed, a penalty, shall pay—age-abiding destruction from the face of the Lord and from the glory of his might—
Whensoever he shall come, to be made all-glorious in his saints, and to be marvelled at in all who believed,—because our witness unto you was believed,—in that day.
Unto which end, we are also praying continually for you, that our God may count, you, worthy of your calling, and fulfil every good-pleasure of goodness and work of faith, with power,—
That the name of our Lord Jesus may be made all-glorious in you, and, ye, in him, According to the favour of our God and Lord Jesus Christ.

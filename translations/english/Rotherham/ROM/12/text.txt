I beseech you therefore, brethren, through the compassions of God, to present your bodies a living, holy sacrifice, unto God acceptable,—your rational divine service;
And be not configuring yourselves unto this age, but be transforming yourselves by the renewing of your mind, to the end ye may be proving what is the thing willed by God—the good and acceptable and perfect.
For I say, through the favour which hath been given me, unto every one who is among you,—not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think, but so to think as to think soberly—as, unto each one, God hath dealt a measure of faith.
For, just as in one body we have many members, yet, all the members, have not the same office,
So, we, the many, are one body in Christ, yet, severally, members one of another.
Now, having gifts of favour, according to the favour given unto us, differing—whether prophesying, [let us use it] according to the proportion of our faith,
Or ministering, [use it] in our ministering, or he that teacheth, [let him use his gift] in his teaching,
Or he that exhorteth, in his exhorting, he that imparteth, [let it be] with liberality, he that taketh a lead, with diligence, he that sheweth mercy, with cheerfulness.
Your love, [be] without hypocrisy,—loathing that which is wicked, cleaving to that which is good;
In your brotherly love, unto one another, being tenderly affectioned, in honour, unto one another, giving preference;
In business, not slothful, in spirit, fervent, to the Lord, doing service,
In hope, rejoicing, in tribulation, enduring, in prayer, persevering,
With the needs of the saints, having fellowship,—hospitality, pursuing.
Bless them that persecute, bless, and do not curse.
Rejoice with them that rejoice, weep with them that weep:
The same thing, one to another regarding,—not the lofty things regarding, but, by the lowly, being led along. Be not getting presumptuous in your own opinion:
Unto no one, evil for evil rendering: providing honourable things before all men:
If possible—so far as dependeth on you, with all men being at peace:
Not avenging, yourselves, beloved, but give place unto their anger; for it is written—Mine, is avenging, I, will recompense;—saith the Lord;
But—if thine enemy hunger, be feeding him, if he thirst, be giving him drink; for, this doing, coals of fire, shalt thou heap upon his head.
Be not overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good.

And it came to pass, when Jeremiah had made an end of speaking unto all the people all the words of Yahweh their God, with which Yahweh their God had sent him unto them,—even all these words,
then spake Azariah son of Hoshaiah, and Johanan son of Kareah, and all the proud men,—saying unto Jeremiah—Falsely, art thou speaking, Yahweh our God hath not sent thee to say, Ye shall not enter Egypt to sojourn there;
but Baruch son of Neriah, is goading thee on against us,—that he may deliver us into the hand of the Chaldeans, to put us to death, or take us away captive to Babylon.
So Johanan son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces and all the people, hearkened not, unto the voice of Yahweh,—by remaining in the land of Judah;
but Johanan son of Kareah and all the captains of the forces took all the remnant of Judah, who had returned, out of all the nations whither they had been driven to sojourn in the land of Judah:
both the men and the women and the children, and the daughters of the king, and every soul that Nebuzaradan chief of the royal executioners had left, with Gedaliah son of Ahikam son of Shaphan,—and Jeremiah the prophet, and Baruch son of Neriah;
and entered the land of Egypt, for they hearkened not unto the voice of Yahweh,—yea entered as far as Tahpanhes.
Then came the word of Yahweh unto Jeremiah, in Tahpanhes, saying:
Take in thy hand great stones and hide them in the mortar that is in the brickyard which is at the entrance of the house of Pharaoh in Tahpanhes,—before the eyes of the men of Judah.
Then shalt thou say unto them—Thus, saith Yahweh of hosts, God of Israel—Behold me! sending and fetching Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, my servant, and I will set his throne over these stones which I have hid,—and he shall spread his canopy over them.
And when he entereth, then will he smite the land of Egypt and deliver Him who is for death to death and Him who is for captivity to captivity, and Him who is for the sword to the sword.
So will I kindle a fire in the houses of the gods of Egypt, and he shall burn them and carry them away Captive,—and shall wrap the land of Egypt about him, just as a shepherd, wrappeth about, him his garment, and shall go forth from thence in peace;
And he shall break in pieces the pillars of Beth-shemesh, which is in the land of Egypt,—And the houses of the gods of Egypt, shall he burn with fire.

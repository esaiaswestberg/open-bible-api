But, of this, be taking note—that, in last days, there will set in perilous seasons;
For men will be—fond of themselves, fond of money, ostentatious, arrogant, defamers, to parents, unyielding, unthankful, unkind,
without natural affection, accepting no truce, given to intrigue, without self-control, uncivilized, unfriendly to good men,
traitors, reckless, beclouded, lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God,
having a form of godliness, but, the power thereof, denying! and, from these, turn away;
For, of these, are they who enter into the houses, and captivate silly women, [women] laden with sins, led on by manifold covetings,
Ever learning and never, unto a personal knowledge of truth, able to come;
Moreover, like as, Jannes and Jambres, withstood Moses, so, these men also, withstand the truth,—men utterly corrupted in their mind, disapproved concerning their faith;
But they shall not force their way further, for, their folly, shall be, fully evident, unto all,—as also, that of those men, became.
But, thou, hast closely studied—my teaching, manner of life, purpose, faith, long-suffering, love, endurance,
persecutions, sufferings, what manner of things, befell me at Antioch, at Iconium, at Lystra, what manner of persecutions, I endured,—and, out of all, the Lord, rescued me;—
Yea and, all who are determined to live in a godly manner in Christ Jesus, will be persecuted;
Whereas, wicked men and howling impostors, will force their way to the worse, deceiving and being deceived.
But, thou,—abide in the things which thou hast learned, and been entrusted with, knowing, from whom, thou hast learned [them],—
And that, from a babe, those sacred letters, thou hast known which are able to make thee wise unto salvation, through the faith which is in Christ Jesus:
Every scripture, [is] God-breathed, and profitable—unto teaching, unto conviction, unto correction, unto the discipline that is in righteousness,—
In order that, ready, may be the man, of God, unto every good work, being well-prepared.

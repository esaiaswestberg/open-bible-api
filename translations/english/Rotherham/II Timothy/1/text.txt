Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus, through the will of God,—according to the promise of life in Christ Jesus;—
Unto Timothy, my beloved child: Favour, mercy, peace, from God our Father, and Christ Jesus our Lord.
Grateful, am I, unto God,—unto whom I am rendering divine service from my progenitors in a pure conscience, that, incessant, hold I the remembrance, concerning thee, in my supplications; day and night,
longing to see thee, being mindful of thy tears,—in order that, with joy, I may be filled:
A reminder, having received, of the unfeigned faith, that is in thee,—such, as dwelt first in thy grandmother Lois, and in thy mother Eunice,—I am persuaded, moreover, that [it dwelleth], in thee also.
For which cause, I put thee in remembrance, to be stirring up God’s gift of favour, which is in thee through means of the laying on of my hands;
For God hath not given us a spirit of cowardice, but of power, and love, and correction.
Be not thou, therefore, put to shame—with regard to the witness of our Lord, nor with regard to me his prisoner; but suffer hardship together with the glad-message according to the power of God,—
Who hath saved us, and called us with a holy calling, not according to our works, but according to the peculiar purpose and favour—which was given to us in Christ Jesus before age-during times,
But hath now been made manifest through means of the forthshining of our Saviour Christ Jesus,—Who, indeed, hath abolished death, and hath thrown light upon life and incorruptibility, through means of the glad-message:
Whereunto, I, have been appointed herald and apostle and teacher;
For which cause, these things also, am I suffering; nevertheless I am not being put to shame, for I know him whom I have believed, and am persuaded that he is, able, to guard, that which I have entrusted, [to him] unto, that, day.
An outline, have thou, of healthful discourses which from me thou hast heard—with the faith and love which are in Christ Jesus:
The noble thing entrusted [to thee], do thou guard, through means of the Holy Spirit which dwelleth within us.
Thou knowest this—that all they who are in Asia have turned away from me,—of whom are Phygelus and Hermogenes.
The Lord grant mercy unto the house, of Onesiphorus, in that, ofttimes, hath he refreshed me, and, as regardeth my chain, hath not been put to shame,
But, happening to be in Rome, he diligently sought out and found me,—
The Lord grant him to find mercy from [the] Lord in, that, day;—and, how many times, in Ephesus, he hath ministered, better art, thou, getting to know.

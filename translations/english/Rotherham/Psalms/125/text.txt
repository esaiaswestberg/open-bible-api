They who trust in Yahweh, [are] like Mount Zion, which shall not be shaken, Age-abidingly, shall it remain.
Jerusalem! mountains, are round about her; and Yahweh, is round about his people, from henceforth even unto times age-abiding.
For the sceptre of lawlessness shall not remain over the allotment of the righteous,—lest the righteous put forth—unto perversity—their hands.
Do good, O Yahweh, unto such as are good, even unto such as are upright in their hearts.
As for them who turn aside unto their crooked ways, Yahweh, will lead them forth, with the workers of iniquity, Prosperity on Israel!

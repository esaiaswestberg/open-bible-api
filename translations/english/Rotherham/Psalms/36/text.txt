Declareth the transgression of the lawless one, within my heart, There is, no dread of God, before his eyes;
For he flattereth himself [too much] in his own eyes, to find his iniquity—to hate [it] .
The words of his mouth, are iniquity and deceit, he hath left off to show discretion by doing well:
Iniquity, deviseth he upon his bed,—he taketh his stand in a way, not good, Wrong, doth he not abhor!
O Yahweh! in the heavens, is thy lovingkindness, Thy faithfulness, as far as the fleecy clouds:
Thy righteousness, is like mighty mountains, and, thy just decrees, are a great resounding deep,—Man and beast, thou savest, O Yahweh!
How precious thy lovingkindness, O God,—Therefore, the sons of men, under the shadow of thy wings, seek refuge:
They abundantly relish the fatness of thy house,—And out of the full stream of thine own pleasures, thou givest them to drink.
For, with thee, is the fountain of life, In thy light, we see light.
Prolong thy lovingkindness unto them who know thee,—and thy righteousness, to the upright in heart.
Let not the foot of pride reach me, nor, the hand of the lawless, scare me away.
There did the workers of iniquity fall,—thrust down and not able to rise!

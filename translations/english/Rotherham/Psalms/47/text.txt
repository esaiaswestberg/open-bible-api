All ye peoples, clap your hands, Shout unto God, with the voice of triumph;
For, Yahweh—as Most High, is to be revered, A great king, over all the earth,
He will subjugate, Peoples under us, and, Tribes of men beneath our feet.
He chooseth for us our inheritance, The excellence of Jacob, which he hath loved. [Selah.]
God hath ascended with a shout, Yahweh, with the sound of a horn.
Sing praises unto God, sing praises, Sing praises to our King, sing praises;
For God is king of all the earth, Sing praises with understanding.
God, hath become king, over the nations, God, hath taken his seat upon his holy throne.
The willing-hearted of the peoples, have gathered themselves together, The people of the God of Abraham; For, to God, belong the shields of the earth, Greatly is he exalted.

Come, let us make a joyful noise to Yahweh, Let us shout in triumph, to the rock of our salvation!
O let us come before his face with thanksgiving, With the sounds of strings, let us shout aloud to him.
For, a great GOD, is Yahweh, And a great king, above all gods.
In whose hand, are the hidden recesses of the earth, And, the peaks of the mountains, are his;
Whose, is the sea, for, he, made it, And, the dry land, his hands, did form.
Enter! let us bow down, and bend low, Let us kneel, before Yahweh our maker;
For, he, is our God, And, we, are the people of his pasture, and the flock of his hand? To-day, if, to his voice, ye will hearken,
Do not harden your heart as at Meribah, As on the day of Massah, in the desert;
When your fathers, tested me, They proved me, yea they also saw what I could do.
Forty years, loathed I that generation, So I said—A people going astray in heart, they are, Even they, have not known my ways!
And I sware in mine anger,—Verily they shall not enter into my rest.

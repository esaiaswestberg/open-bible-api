God, be favorable to us and bless us, Cause his face to shine upon us. [Selah.]
That thy way may be known throughout the earth, Throughout all nations, thy saving help!
Peoples will praise thee, O God, Peoples will, all of them, praise thee,
Races of men, will be glad and shout for joy, Because thou wilt judge peoples with equity, And, races of men throughout the earth, thou wilt lead. [Selah.]
Peoples will praise thee, O God,—Peoples will, all of them, praise thee.
Earth, will have given her increase, God, our own God, will bless us:
God, will bless us, That all the ends of the earth, may revere him.

Wherefore have nations assembled in tumult? Or should, peoples, mutter an empty thing?
The kings of earth take their station, and, grave men, have met by appointment together,—against Yahweh, and against his Anointed One [saying] :
Let us break asunder their bonds,—and cast from us their cords!
He that sitteth in the heavens, will laugh,—My Lord, will mock at them:
Then, will he speak unto them in his anger, and, in his wrath, confound them:
Yet, I, have installed my king,—on Zion my holy mountain.
Let me tell of a decree,—Yahweh, hath said unto me, My son, thou art, I, to-day, have begotten thee:
Ask of me, and let me give nations as thine inheritance, and, as thy possession, the ends of the earth:
Thou shalt shepherd them with a sceptre of iron,—as a potter’s vessel, shalt thou dash them in pieces.
Now, therefore, ye kings, show your prudence, Be admonished, ye judges of earth:
Serve Yahweh with reverence, and exult with trembling:
Kiss the son, lest he be angry, and ye perish by the way, for soon might be kindled his anger,—How happy are all who seek refuge in him!

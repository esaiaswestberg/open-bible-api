Praise ye Yah, Praise, O my soul, Yahweh.
I will praise Yahweh while I live! I will make melody to my God while I continue!
Do not ye trust in nobles, in a son of man who hath no deliverance:
His spirit, goeth forth, he returneth to his ground, In that very day, his thoughts perish.
How happy is he that hath the GOD of Jacob as his help, whose hope, is on Yahweh his God:—
Who made The heavens and the earth, The sea and all that is therein, Who keepeth faithfulness to times age-abiding:
Who executeth justice for the oppressed, who giveth food to the famishing, Yahweh, who liberateth prisoners;
Yahweh, who opened [the eyes of] the blind, Yahweh, who raiseth the prostrate, Yahweh, who loveth the righteous;
Yahweh, who preserveth sojourners, The fatherless and widows, he relieveth,—but, the way of the lawless, he overturneth.
Yahweh, will reign, to times age-abiding, Thy God, O Zion, to generation after generation. Praise ye Yah!

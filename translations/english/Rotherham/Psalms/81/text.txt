Shout ye for joy, unto God our strength, Sound the note of triumph, to the God of Jacob;
Raise a melody, and strike the timbrel, The lyre so sweet, with the harp:
Blow, at the new moon, the horn, At the full moon, for the day of our sacred festival:
For, a statute to Israel, it is, A regulation, by the God of Jacob;
A testimony in Joseph, he appointed it, When he went forth over the land of Egypt: A language I liked not, used I to hear;
I took away, from the burden, his shoulder, his hands, from the clay, were set free.
In distress, thou didst cry, and I delivered thee,—I answered thee, within a hiding-place of thunder, I proved thee by the waters of Meribah. [Selah.]
Hear, O my people, and I will adjure thee, O Israel, if thou wilt hearken unto me!
There shall not be, within thee, a foreign GOD,—Neither shalt thou bow down to a strange GOD:
I, Yahweh, am thy God, Who brought thee up out of the land of Egypt,—Open wide thy mouth, that I may fill it.
But my people, hearkened not, unto my voice, Even, Israel, inclined not unto me.
So then I let them go on in the stubbornness of their own heart,[—] They might walk in their own counsels!
If, my people, were hearkening unto me, [If,] Israel, in my ways, would walk,
Right soon, their foes, would I subdue, And, against their adversaries, would I turn my hand:
The haters of Yahweh, should come cringing unto him, Then let their own good time be age-abiding!
Then would he feed them from the marrow of the wheat, Yea, out of the rock—with honey, would I satisfy thee.

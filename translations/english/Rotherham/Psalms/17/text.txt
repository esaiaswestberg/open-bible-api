Hear, O Yahweh, the right, Attend to my loud cry, Give ear unto my prayer, on lips that would not deceive:
From before thee, let my sentence come forth, Thine eyes, behold with equity.
Thou hast tested my heart, hast made inspection by night, hast refined me until thou couldst find nothing, Had I devised evil, my mouth should not have transgressed:
As for the workings of men, By the word of thy lips, have, I, taken heed of the paths of the violent one.
Thou hast held fast my goings on to thy ways, My footsteps have not been shaken:
I, have called upon thee, for thou wilt answer me, O GOD,—Incline thine ear unto me, Hear thou my speech:
Let thy lovingkindness be distinguished, thou Saviour of such as seek refuge from them who lift themselves up against thy right hand.
Guard me, as the pupil of the eye,—Under the shadow of thy wings, wilt thou hide me:
From the face of lawless ones who have treated me with violence, the foes of my soul, who come round against me:
Their own fat [heart], have they shut up,—With their mouth, have they spoken proudly.
As for our own goings, now, have they surrounded us,—Their eyes, they fix, bending to the earth:
His likeness, is as a lion, that longeth to rend, and as a young lion, lurking in secret places.
Rise, Yahweh! Confront his face, Bring him down, Deliver my soul from the lawless one [who is] thy sword:
From men [who are] thy hand, O Yahweh, From the men of this age, whose portion, is among the living, and, with thy treasure, thou fillest their bosom,—They must be satisfied with sons, And must leave their abundance to their children:—
I, in righteousness, shall behold thy face, Shall be satisfied when awakened by a vision of thee.

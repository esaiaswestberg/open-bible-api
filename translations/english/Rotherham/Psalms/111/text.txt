Praise ye Yah! I will give thanks unto Yahweh, with a whole heart, in the circle of the upright and the assembly.
Great are the works of Yahweh, sought out, by all who find pleasure therein.
Honourable and majestic, is his doing, and, his righteousness, standeth for aye.
A memorial, hath he made by his wonders, Gracious and compassionate, is Yahweh.
Food, hath he given to them who revere him, He will remember, age-abidingly, his covenant.
The might of his works, hath he declared to his people, that he may give them the inheritance of the nations.
The works of his hands, are faithful and just, Firm are all his precepts;
Upheld to futurity, to times age-abiding, done in faithfulness and equity.
Ransom, hath he sent to his people, He hath commanded, to times age-abiding, his covenant, Holy and reverend, is his Name.
The beginning of wisdom, is the reverence of Yahweh, Good discretion, have all that do them, His praise, endureth for aye.

O Yahweh, hear my prayer, Give ear to my supplications, In thy faithfulness, answer me, in thy righteousness.
Do not then enter into judgment with thy servant, for no one living, can appear just before thee.
For an enemy hath pursued my soul, hath crushed, to the earth, my life, hath made me dwell in dark places, like the ancient dead.
Therefore hath my spirit, fainted concerning myself, Within me, hath, my heart, been confounded.
I have remembered the days of aforetime, I have talked with myself of every deed of thine, Of the work of thy hands, I would speak:
I have spread out my hands unto thee, My soul, is as a thirsty land, for thee. [Selah.]
Speedily answer me, O Yahweh, My spirit faileth,—Do not hide thy face from me, or I shall be made like unto them who go down into the pit.
Let me hear, in the morning, thy lovingkindness, for, in thee, have, I trusted,—Let me know the way in which I should walk, for, unto thee, have I uplifted my soul.
Rescue me from my foes, O Yahweh, Unto thee, have I come seeking refuge.
Teach me to do thy good pleasure, for, thou, art my God,—Thy spirit, is good, thou wilt set me down to rest in a level land.
For the sake of thy Name, O Yahweh, wilt thou give unto me life, In thy righteousness, wilt thou bring forth, out of distress, my soul;
And, in thy lovingkindness, wilt thou exterminate my foes,—and destroy all the adversaries of my soul, because, I, am thy servant.

Many a time, have they harassed me from my youth, well may Israel say:
Many a time, have they harassed me from youth, yet have they not prevailed against me.
Upon my back, have ploughmen ploughed, They have lengthened their furrow!
Yahweh, is righteous, He hath cut asunder the cords of the lawless.
Let all who hate Zion, be ashamed and shrink back:
Let them become like the grass of housetops, which, before it is pulled up, hath withered;
Wherewith no reaper, hath filled his hand, nor binder, his bosom:
Neither have the passers-by ever said, The blessing of Yahweh, be unto you,—We have blessed you in the Name of Yahweh.

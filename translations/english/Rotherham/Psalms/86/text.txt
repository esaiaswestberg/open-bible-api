Bow down, O Yahweh, thine ear—answer me, For, oppressed and needy, am I;
O guard my life, For, a man of lovingkindness, am I,—Save thy servant, O thou my God, [Thy servant] who trusteth in thee;
Show me favour, O My Lord, For, unto thee, do I cry, all the day;
Rejoice the soul of thy servant, For, unto thee, O My Lord, my soul, do I lift.
For, thou, O My Lord, art good and forgiving, And abundant in lovingkindness, to all who call upon thee.
Give ear, O Yahweh, unto my prayer, And attend unto the voice of my supplications.
In the day of my distress, will I call upon thee, For thou wilt answer me.
There is none like unto thee, among the gods, O My Lord, And nothing like thy works.
All nations whom thou hast made, Shall come in and bow down before thee, O My Lord, That they may glorify thy Name.
For great thou art, and doest wondrous things, Thou, O God, of thyself alone.
Point out to me, O Yahweh, thy way, I will walk steadfastly in thy truth, My heart will rejoice to revere thy Name.
I will give thee thanks, Adonay, my God, with all my heart, And will glorify thy Name unto times age-abiding.
For, thy lovingkindness, is great towards me, And thou hast rescued my soul from Hades beneath.
O God, the insolent, have arisen against me, And, the assembly of tyrants, have sought my life, And have not set thee before them.
But, thou, O My Lord, art, A God of compassion and favour, Slow to anger, and abundant in lovingkindness a faithfulness.
Turn thou unto me, and show me favour,—Give thy strength to thy servant, And save the son of thy handmaid.
Perform with me a token for good,—That they who hate me may see and be ashamed, In that, thou, Yahweh, hast helped me and comforted me.

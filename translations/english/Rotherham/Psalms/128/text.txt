How happy is every one that revereth Yahweh, who walketh in his ways!
The labour of thine own hands, surely thou shalt eat. How happy thou, and well for thine!
Thy wife, like a fruitful vine, within the recesses of thy house,—Thy children, like plantings of olive-trees, round about thy table.
Lo! thus, shall be blessed the man who revereth Yahweh.
Yahweh will bless thee, out of Zion,—and behold thou the welfare of Jerusalem, all the days of thy life!
And behold thou thy children’s children,—Prosperity on Israel!

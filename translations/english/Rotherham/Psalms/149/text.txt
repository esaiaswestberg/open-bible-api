Praise ye Yah, Sing to Yahweh a song that is new, his praise in the convocation of the men of lovingkindness.
Let Israel rejoice in him that made him, Let the sons of Zion exult in their king;
Let them praise his Name in the dance, with timbrel and lyre, Let them make music to him.
For Yahweh is taking pleasure in his people, He will beautify humbled ones with victory.
Let the men of lovingkindness exult as they glory, Let them shout aloud upon their beds:
The high songs of GOD be in their throat, and a two-edged sword in their hand:
To execute an avenging among the nations, rebukes among the peoples:
To bind their kings with fetters, and their honoured ones with iron bands:
To execute upon them the sentence written, An honour, shall it be to all his men of lovingkindness. Praise ye Yah!

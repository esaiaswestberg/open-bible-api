I will lift up mine eyes, unto the mountains, From whence cometh my help!
My help, is from Yahweh, who made heavens and earth.
May he not suffer thy foot, to slip, May thy keeper, not slumber!
Lo! neither will slumber nor sleep, The keeper of Israel.
Yahweh, is thy keeper, Yahweh, is thy shade, on thy right hand:
By day, the sun, shall not smite, nor, the moon, by night.
Yahweh, will keep thee from all harm, He will keep thy life.
Yahweh, will keep thy going out and thy coming in, from henceforth, even unto times age-abiding.

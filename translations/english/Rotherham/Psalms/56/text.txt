Show me favour, O God, For weak man hath panted for me, All the day, a fighter oppresseth me:
Mine adversaries have panted all the day, For, many, are fighting with me, loftily.
What day I am afraid, I, unto thee will direct my confidence.
In God, I will praise his cause,—In God, have I trusted, I will not fear, What can flesh do unto me?
All the day, they wrest, my words, Against me, all their devices are for mischief;
They stir up strife—they lie hid, They, mark my steps,—Seeing they have waited for my life.
Because of iniquity, recompense thou them,—In anger, bring thou down, the peoples, O God.
My wandering, hast, thou, recorded,—Put thou my tears in thy bottle, Are they not in thy record?
Then, shall my foes turn back, in the day I cry, This, I know, for God is mine!
In God, will I praise with good cause: In Yahweh, will I praise with good cause;
In God, have I trusted, I will not fear, What can a son of earth do unto me!
Upon me, O God, are thy vows, I will pay back praises unto thee.
For thou hast rescued my soul from death, Wilt thou not [rescue] my feet from stumbling? That I may walk to and fro, before God, In the light of life.

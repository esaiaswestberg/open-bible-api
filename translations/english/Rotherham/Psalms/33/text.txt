Shout for joy, ye righteous, in Yahweh, To the upright, seemly is praise.
Give ye thanks unto Yahweh with the lyre, With a harp of ten strings, make ye music unto him.
Sing unto him, a song that is new, With skill, sweep the strings, with loud noise.
For right is the word of Yahweh, and, all his work, is in faithfulness:
Who loveth righteousness and justice, With the lovingkindness of Yahweh, the earth is full.
By the word of Yahweh, the heavens were made, and, by the spirit of his mouth, all their host:
Who gathered as into a skin-bottle the waters of the sea, Delivering, into treasuries, the roaring deeps.
Let all the earth, stand in awe of Yahweh, Of him, be in dread, all ye inhabitants of the world;
For, he, spake, and it was, He, commanded, and it stood forth.
Yahweh, hath frustrated the counsel of nations, hath brought to nothing the devices of peoples.
The counsel of Yahweh, to times age-abiding, shall stand, The devices of his heart, from generation to generation.
How happy the nation whose God is, Yahweh, The people he hath chosen as his own inheritance!
Out of the heavens, hath Yahweh looked, He hath seen all the sons of men:
Out of his settled place of abode, hath he fixed his gaze on all the inhabitants of the earth:
Who fashioneth their heart all together, Who understandeth all their doings.
Not a king, can be saved by greatness of force, nor, hero, deliver himself by greatness of strength:
A deception, is the horse, for victory, and, by his great strength, shall he not deliver.
Lo! the eye of Yahweh, is toward them who revere him, unto such as are waiting for his lovingkindness:
To rescue, from death, their soul, and to keep them alive in famine.
Our own soul, hath waited for Yahweh, Our help and our shield, is he!
For, in him, shall our heart rejoice, For, in his holy Name, have we trusted.
Be thy lovingkindness, O Yahweh, upon us, According as we have waited for thee.

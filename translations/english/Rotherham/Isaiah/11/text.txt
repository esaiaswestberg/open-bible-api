But there shall come forth a shoot from the stock of Jesse,—And, a sprout from his roots, shall bear fruit;
And the spirit of Yahweh shall rest upon him,—The spirit of wisdom and understanding, The spirit of counsel and might, The spirit of knowledge and reverence of Yahweh;
So will he find fragrance, in the reverence of Yahweh, And not, by the sight of his eyes, will he judge, Nor by the hearing of his ears, will he decide;
But he will judge with righteousness! them who are poor, And decide with equity! for the oppressed of the land,—And he will smite the land With the sceptre of his mouth, And with the breath of his lips, will he slay the lawless one;
And righteousness shall be the girdle of his loins,—And faithfulness the girdle of his reins;
And the wolf shall dwell with the lamb, And, the leopard, with the kid, shall lie down,—And the calf and the young lion and the fatling—together, With, a little child, leading them;
And the cow, with the bear shall find pasture, Together, shall their young ones, lie down,—And, the lion, like the ox, shall eat straw;
And the sucking child shall caress over the hole of the asp, Yea over the viper’s den, hath the weaned child stretched out his hand:
They shall not hurt—nor destroy, in all my holy mountain,—For filled is the land with the knowledge of Yahweh, As the waters, to the sea, form a covering.
And there shall come to be, in that day, A root of Jesse, which shall be standing as an ensign of peoples, Unto him, shall nations seek,—And, his resting-place, shall be, glorious.
And it shall come to pass in that day, That My Lord will again a second time set his hand, to possess himself of the remnant of his people,—who shall be left—from Assyria and from Egypt and from Pathros and from Ethiopia and from Elam and from Shinar and from Hamath and from the Coastlands of the sea;
And he will lift up a standard to the nations, And will gather the outcasts of Israel,—And the dispersed of Judah, will he collect, From the four corners of the earth.
And the envy of Ephraim shall be removed, And the vexatious doings of Judah, shall be cut off: Ephraim shall not envy Judah, and Judah, shall not vex Ephraim;
But they shall fly on the wing of the Philistines in the west, Together, shall they make prey of the sons of the east,—On Edom and Moab, putting forth their hand, With the sons of Ammon hearkening unto them.
And Yahweh, will devote to destruction, the gulf of the Egyptian sea, And will brandish his hand against the River [="Euphrates"], in the full force of his spirit,—And will smite it in the seven streams And cause a marching through in sandals,
So shall there be a highway for the remnant of his people who shall be left out of Assyria,—Like as it was to Israel, in the day that he came up out of the land of Egypt!

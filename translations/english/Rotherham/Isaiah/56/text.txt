Thus, saith Yahweh, Observe ye justice, And execute righteousness,—For near, is My salvation, to come in, and My righteousness to be revealed.
How happy the frail man, who doeth this! Yea the son of the earth-born who firmly graspeth it! Keeping the sabbath lest he profane it, and Keeping his own hand from doing any wrong.
And let not the son of the foreigner, who hath joined himself unto Yahweh, speak, saying, Yahweh, will separate, me from his people, Neither let the eunuch, say, Lo! I, am a tree dried up!
For thus, saith Yahweh—Of the eunuchs, Who shall keep my sabbaths, And choose what I delight in,—And lay firm hold on my covenant,
That I will give unto them—In my house, And within my walls, A sign and a name, better than sons and daughters,—A name age-abiding, will I give him, which shall not be cut off.
And, as for the sons of the foreigner—Who have joined themselves unto Yahweh To wait upon him, and To love the name of Yahweh, To become his for servants,—Every one who keepeth the sabbath, lest he profane it. And who, layeth firm hold on my covenant,
Surely I will bring them into my holy mountain And make them joyful in my house of prayer, Their ascending-offerings and their sacrifices, being accepted upon mine altar,—For, my house, a house of prayer, shall be called, for all the peoples!
Declareth My Lord, Yahweh, Who is gathering the outcasts of Israel:—Yet others, will I gather unto him Besides his own gathered ones.
All ye beasts of the field! come ye to devour, All ye beasts in the forest.
His watchmen, are blind None of them, know, All of them, are dumb dogs, they cannot bark,—Dreaming, sleeping, loving to slumber.
And, the dogs, are greedy they know not to be satisfied. Yea, they, are shepherds who know not to discern,—All of them unto their own way, have turned, Every man to his unjust gain, on every hand:
Come ye! I will fetch wine Let us fill ourselves with strong drink,—And like this day, shall, to-morrow be—Great beyond measure!

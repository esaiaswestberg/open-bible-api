twenty-five years old, was Jotham when he began to reign, and, sixteen years, reigned he in Jerusalem,—and, the name of his mother, was Jerushah, daughter of Zadok.
And he did that which was right in the eyes of Yahweh, according to all that Uzziah his father had done, only he entered not into the temple of Yahweh,—though still were the people acting corruptly.
He, built the upper gate of the house of Yahweh,-and, on the wall of Ophel, built he extensively.
Cities also, built he, in the hill country of Judah,—and, in the thick woods, built he fortresses and towers.
He, also made war against the king of the sons of Ammon, and prevailed against them, and the sons of Ammon gave him, during that year, a hundred talents of silver, and ten thousand measures of wheat, and, of barley, ten thousand,—this, did the sons of Ammon render him, both in the second year, and the third.
So Jotham strengthened himself,—for he fixed his ways before Yahweh his God.
But, the rest of the story of Jotham, and all his wars, and his ways, lo! there they are written in the book of the Kings of Israel and Judah.
Twenty-five years old, was he when he began to reign,—and, sixteen years, reigned he in Jerusalem.
And Jotham slept with his fathers, and they buried him, in the city of David,—and Ahaz his son reigned in his stead.

For lo! the day, cometh, that burneth as a furnace,—and, all the proud and everyone who worketh lawlessness, shall be, stubble, and the day that cometh, shall consume them utterly, saith Yahweh of hosts, that it shall leave them neither root nor branch.
So shall the sun of righteousness, arise to you who revere my Name, with healing in his wings,—and ye shall come forth and leap for joy like calves let loose from the stall;
And ye shall tread down the lawless, for they shall be ashes under the soles of your feet,—in the day when I am working with effect, saith Yahweh of hosts.
Remember ye the law of Moses my servant,—which I commanded him in Horeb, for all Israel, statutes and regulations.
Lo! I am sending unto you Elijah the prophet,—before the coming of the great and awful day of Yahweh;
And he shall bring back the heart of the fathers unto the children, and the heart of the children unto their fathers,—lest I come, and smite the land, with utter destruction.

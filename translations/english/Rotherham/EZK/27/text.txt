And the word of Yahweh came unto me, saying:
Thou, therefore, son of man, Take up over Tyre a dirge;
And thou shalt say unto Tyre, O thou that dwellest by the entrances of the sea, Thou merchant of the peoples unto many shores,— Thus, saith My Lord, Yahweh, O Tyre, Thou saidst, I, am the perfection of beauty!
In the heart of the seas, were thy bounds, —Thy builders perfected thy beauty:
With fir-trees from Senir, but they for thee all the two-decked vessels,— Cedar from Lebanon, fetched they, to make masts for thee:
With oaks from Bashan, made they thine oars,— Thy benches, made they of ivory, inlaid with boxwood, From the shores of the West:
Of fine linen with embroidered work from Egypt, was thy sail, To serve thee for ensign,— Blue and purple from the shores of Aeolis became thine awning:
the inhabitants of Zidon and Arvad, Became rowers for thee,— Thine own skilled men O Tyre, were within thee, They were thy sailors:
the elders of Byblus and the skilled men thereof, were within thee, Thy calkers,— All the ships of the sea and their mariners, were within thee, To carry on thy traffic,
They of Persia and Lud and Phut were in thine army, Thy men of war,— Shield and helmet, hung they up within thee, They set forth thy splendour:
The sons of Arvad, :with thine army, were upon thy walls round about, And valorous in thy towers,— Their shields, hung they up on thy walls round about, They perfected thy beauty:
Tarshish was a trader of thine. For the abundance of all wealth,— With silver iron. tin and lead, Took they part in thy traffic:
Javan. Tubal and Meshech, They were merchants of thine,— With the persons of men and vessels of bronze, Shared they in thy barter:
Some of the house of Togarmah, with horses and horsemen and mules, Took part in thy traffic:
the sons of Dedan were merchants of thine, Many, isles, took the merchandise of thy hand, —Horns of ivory and ebony, gave they back to thee in exchange:
Syria, was a trader of thine For the abundance of thy manufactures,- With carbuncle and purple and embroidery and fine linen and coral and rubies, Took they part in thy traffic:
Judah and the land of Israel, They, were merchants of thine,— With the wheat of Minnith and the sweets of pannag and honey and oil and balsam, Shared they in thy barter:
Damascus was a trader of thine For the multitude of thy manufactures For the multitude of all wealth,- With the wine of Helbon and white wool:
Wedan and Javan, from Uzal, Brought into thy traffic,— Steel, cassia and calamus, Were, in thy merchandise:
Dedan was a merchant of thine,- With spreading wraps for riding:
Arabia and all the princes of Kedar, They, were traders at thy service,— With lambs and rams and he-goats, With these, were they traders of thine:
The merchants of Sheba and Raamah, They were merchants of thine,— With the chief of all spices and with every kind of precious stone and gold, Took they part in thy traffic:
Haran and Canneh and Eden, the merchants of Sheba,—Asshur. Chilmad, Were merchants of thine:
Those were thy merchants for gorgeous garments, for wrappings of blue and embroidery, and for treasure-chests of variegated cloth,—for cords, twisted and strong, in thy market:
the ships of Tarshish, were thy masts Carrying on thy barter, So wast thou filled and becamest very glorious In the heart of the seas.
Into mighty waters, have they brought thee, the rowers—even thee,— the east wind, hath broken thee In the heart of the seas:
Thy wealth and thy wares, thy merchandise thy mariners, and thy sailors,-thy calkers and the barterers of thy merchandise and all thy men of war who are in thee and in all thy gathered host which is in thy midst Shall fall into the heart of the seas, In the day of thy fall.
At the sound of the outcry of thy pilots, the coasts shall quake:
Then shall come down from their ships all that handle the oar, mariners, all the sailors of the sea— Upon the land, shall they take up their station;
And make loud [lament] over thee, with their voice, And make biter outcry,- And shall lift up dust on their heads, In ashes, shall roll themselves;
And shall make bald for thee a baldness And gird them with sackcloth,— And shall weep for thee in bitterness of soul A bitter lamentation;
And shall take up for thee in their Wailing: a dirge, And shall chant over thee,- Who is like Tyre? Like the Sent One in the midst of the sea?
By the going forth of thy commodities out of the seas, Thou didst satisfy many peoples, By the multitude of thy wares and of thy merchandise, Thou didst enrich the kings of the earth.
Now, thou art wrecked out of the seas In the depths of waters,— Thy merchandise and all thy gathered host In thy midst, have fallen.
All the dwellers in the coastlands, Are astounded over thee,- And their kings have been made to shudder a shuddering, To be troubled in countenance.
The traders among the peoples, have hissed over thee: A terror, hast thou become, And, art not, Unto times age-abiding.

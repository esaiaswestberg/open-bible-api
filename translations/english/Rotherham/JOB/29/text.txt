And Job again took up his measure, and said,
Oh that it were with me as in the months of old, as in the days, when, GOD, used to watch over me;
When his lamp shone over my head, by whose light, I could go through darkness;
As I was, in the days of my prime, when, the intimacy of GOD, was over my tent;
While yet the Almighty was with me, round about me, were my young men;
When my steps were bathed in milk, and, the rock, poured out beside me, rivulets of oil:
When I went out to the gate unto the city, in the open place, made ready my seat,
Young men saw me, and hid themselves, and, the aged, arose—they stood;
Rulers, restrained speech, and, a hand, laid they on their mouth;
The voice of nobles, was hushed, and their tongue to their palate, did cleave;
When, the ear, heard, then it pronounced me happy, When, the eye, saw, then it bare me witness;
Because I used to deliver the oppressed who was crying out for aid, the fatherless also, and him that had no helper;
The blessing of him that was ready to perish, upon me was wont to descend, and, the heart of the widow, caused I to sing for joy;
Righteousness, I put on, and it clothed me, Like a robe and turban, was my, justice;
Eyes, became I to the, blind, and, feet to the lame, was, I!
A father, was, I, to the needy, and, as for the cause which I knew not, I used to search it out;
And I shivered the fangs of the perverse,—and, out of his teeth, I tare the prey.
Then said I, Like a stem, shall I grow old, yea, as the sand, shall I multiply days:
My root, is laid open to the waters, and, the dew, shall lodge for the night in my boughs;
Mine honour, shall be young again with me, and, my bow, in my hand, be renewed.
To me, men hearkened, and waited, and kept silence for my counsel;
After I had spoken, they spake not again, and, upon them, used my speech to drop;
And they waited, as for rain, for me, and, their mouths, they opened wide for the spring-rain;
I laughed at them—they lost confidence, and, the light of my countenance, they suffered not to fail;
I chose out their way, and sat chief,—and abode, as king, in an army, as one who, to mourners, giveth comfort.

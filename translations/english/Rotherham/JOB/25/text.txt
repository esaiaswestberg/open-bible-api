Then responded Bildad the Shuhite, and said:—
Dominion and dread, are with him, who causeth prosperity among his lofty ones;
Is there any number to his troops? And upon whom ariseth not his light?
How then shall, a mortal, be just with GOD? Or how shall he be pure who is born of a woman?
Look as far as the moon, and it is not clear, and, the stars, are not bright in his eyes!
How much less a mortal who is a creeping thing? Or a son of the earth-born who is a worm?

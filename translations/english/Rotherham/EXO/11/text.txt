Then said Yahweh unto Moses—Yet one plague, will I bring in upon Pharaoh and upon Egypt, after that, he will let you go from hence,—when he doth let you go, he will, altogether drive, you out from hence.
Speak, I pray you, in the ears of the people,—and let them ask—every man of his neighbour, and every woman of her neighbour, articles of silver and articles of gold.
And Yahweh gave the people favour, in the eyes of the Egyptians,—even the man Moses himself, was exceeding great in the land of Egypt,—in the eyes of Pharaoh’s servants and in the eyes of the people.
And Moses said, Thus saith Yahweh,—About midnight, am, I, going forth in the midst of Egypt;
then shall every firstborn in the land of Egypt die, from the firstborn of Pharaoh who is sitting on his throne, unto the firstborn of the handmaid who is behind the two millstones,—and every firstborn of beasts;
then shall there be a great outcry, in all the land of Egypt,—such, as never was and, such, as shall not be again.
But against none of the sons of Israel, shall a dog sharpen his tongue, neither against man nor beast,—that ye may know that Yahweh maketh a difference between Egypt and Israel.
So shall all these thy servants come down unto me and bow themselves down to me saying—Go forth, thou and all the people who are in thy footsteps, and after that, will I go forth. And he went forth from Pharaoh, in a heat of anger.
And Yahweh had said unto Moses, Pharaoh will not hearken unto you,—that my wonders may be multiplied in the land of Egypt.
So then, Moses and Aaron, did all these wonders before Pharaoh,—but Yahweh let Pharaoh’s heart wax bold, and he did not let the sons of Israel go out of his land.

Then came near the heads of fathers, belonging to the family of the sons of Gilead son of Machir son of Manasseh, out of the families of the sons of Joseph,—and spake before Moses, and before the princes, heads of fathers belonging to the sons of Israel;
and they said—Unto my lord, did Yahweh give command, to bestow the land as an inheritance, by lot, unto the sons of Israel,—my lord, therefore, was commanded by Yahweh, to give the inheritance of Zelophehad our brother unto his daughters.
When, therefore, unto any one from among the sons of the other tribes of the sons of Israel, they become wives their inheritance shall disappear out of the inheritance of our fathers, and be added to the inheritance of the tribe to which they shall be received,—and so out of the lot of our inheritance, shall it disappear,
And when the jubilee shall come to the sons of Israel, then shall their inheritance be added unto the inheritance of the tribe to which they shall be received—and, out of the, inheritance of the tribe of our fathers, shall their inheritance disappear.
Then Moses commanded the sons of Israel, at the bidding of Yahweh saying,—A right thing, are, the tribe of the sons of Joseph, speaking,
This, is the thing which Yahweh hath commanded, as to the daughters of Zelophehad saying: Unto whomsoever it may be good in their eyes, let them become wives,—save only unto the family of the tribe of their father, let them become wives.
So shall no inheritance belonging to the sons of Israel go round from tribe to tribe,—for the sons of Israel shall, each one, cleave, unto the inheritance of the tribe of his fathers,
And, every daughter possessing all inheritance from among the tribes of the sons of Israel, unto one of the family of the tribe of her father, shall become wife,—to the intent that the sons of Israel may possess each one the inheritance of his fathers;
and no inheritance go round from one tribe to another tribe,—for the tribes of the sons of Israel shall cleave, each one unto his own inheritance.
As Yahweh commanded Moses, so, did the daughters of Zelophehad.
Thus then did Mahlah, Tirzah, and Hoglah, and Milchah, and Noah, the daughters of Zelophehad, become wives, unto the sons of their father’s brethren.
Unto men from among the families of the son of Manasseh son of Joseph, became they wives,—and so their inheritance remained with the tribe of the family of their father.
These are the commandments and the regulations which Yahweh gave in charge, by the hand of Moses, unto the sons of Israel,—in the waste plains of Moab, by Jordan near Jericho.

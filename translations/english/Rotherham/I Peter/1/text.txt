Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, unto the chosen pilgrims of the dispersion, throughout Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia and Bithynia,—
[Chosen] according to the fore-knowledge of God the Father, in sanctification of Spirit, unto obedience and the sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ, Favour unto you, and peace, be multiplied!
Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, Who, according to his great mercy, hath regenerated us unto a living hope, through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from among the dead,
Unto an inheritance, incorruptible and undefiled and unfading, reserved in the heavens for you
who, in God’s power, are being guarded through faith unto salvation—ready to be revealed in the last ripe time:
Wherein ye exult, though, for a little, just now, if needful, put to grief in manifold temptations,
In order that the proving of your faith—much more precious than of gold that perisheth even though, by means of fire, it is proved—may be found unto praise and glory and honour in the revealing of Jesus Christ,—
Whom, not having seen, ye love, on whom, though at present not looking, but believing, ye exult with joy unspeakable and filled with glory,
Being about to bear away the end of your faith—a salvation of souls:
Concerning which salvation, prophets—who concerning the favour for you, did prophesy—sought out and searched out,
Searching into what particular, or what manner, of season the Spirit of Christ which was in them was pointing to, when witnessing beforehand as to—The sufferings, for Christ, and the glories, after these,—
Unto whom it was revealed—that, Not unto themselves, but unto us, they were ministering them, which things have, now, been announced unto you through them who have told you the good tidings with Holy Spirit sent forth from heaven: into which things messengers are coveting to obtain a nearer view.
Wherefore, girding up the loins of your mind, keeping sober, perseveringly direct your hope unto the favour, being borne along to you, in the revealing of Jesus Christ:
As obedient persons, not configuring yourselves unto your former covetings in your ignorance:
But, according as he that hath called you is holy, do, ye yourselves, also become, holy in all manner of behaviour,—
Inasmuch as it is written—Holy shall ye be, because, I, am holy.
And, if, as Father, ye are invoking him who, without respect of persons, judgeth according to each man’s work, with reverence, for the time of your sojourning, behave ye;
Knowing that, Not with corruptible things, with silver or gold, have ye been redeemed from your unmeaning behaviour paternally handed down,
But with precious blood, as of a lamb, unblemished and unspotted, of an Anointed One,—
Foreknown, indeed, before the foundation of the world, but made manifest at a last stage of the times, for the sake of you
who, through him, are faithful towards God,—Who raised him from among the dead, and glory to him gave, So that your faith and hope are directed towards God:
Having purified, your souls, by the obedience of the truth, unto unfeigned brotherly affection, from the heart, love, one another, earnestly;
Having been regenerated—Not out of corruptible seed, but incorruptible—through means of the word of a Living and Abiding God;
Inasmuch as—All flesh, is as grass, and, all the glory thereof, as the flower of grass,—The grass hath withered, and the flower hath fallen out,
But the declaration of the Lord age-abidingly remaineth; And, this, is a declaration which in the joyful message hath been announced unto you.

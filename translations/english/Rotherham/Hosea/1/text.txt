The word of Yahweh which came unto Hosea son of Beeri, in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, Hezekiah, kings of Judah,—and in the days of Jeroboam son of Joash, king of Israel.
The beginning of the word of Yahweh with Hosea, was,—that Yahweh said unto Hosea, Go take thee a woman of unchastity, and the children of unchastity, for, unchastely indeed, hath the land been going away from following Yahweh.
So he went and took Gomer, daughter of Diblaim,—and she conceived and bare him a son.
Then said Yahweh unto him, Call his name Jezreel: for, yet a little, and I will visit the bloodshed of Jezreel upon the house of Jehu, and will cause to cease the kingdom of the house of Israel.
And it shall come to pass, in that day, that I will break the bow of Israel, in the vale of Jezreel.
Then conceived she again and bare a daughter, and he said to him, Call her name Lo-ruhamah ["Uncompassionated"],—for, not again any more, will I have compassion upon the house of Israel, that I should, forgive, them;
but, on the house of Judah, will I have compassion, and I will save them, as Yahweh their God,—but will not save them by bow, or by sword, or by battle, by horses, or by horsemen.
And, when she had weaned Lo-ruhamah, she conceived, and bare a son.
Then said he, Call his name Lo-ammi [="No people of mine"],—for ye are Lo-ammi ["No people of mine"], and, I, will not be yours.
Yet shall the number of the sons of Israel become like the sand of the sea, which can neither he measured, nor numbered,—and it shall come to pass, in the place where it used to be said to them, No people of mine, are ye, it shall be said to them, Sons of a Living God!
Then shall the sons of Judah and the sons of Israel, gather themselves together, as one, and shall appoint them one head, and come up out of the earth,—for great shall be the day of Jezreel.

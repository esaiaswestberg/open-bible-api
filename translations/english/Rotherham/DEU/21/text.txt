When there shall be found one slain on the soil which Yahweh thy God is giving unto thee to possess, lying prostrate in the field,—it not being known who smote him,
then shall thine elders and thy judges go forth,—and measure unto the cities that are round about the slain;
and it shall be that the city that is nearest unto the slain, the elders of that city shall take a heifer of the herd which hath not been wrought with, which hath not drawn in a yoke;
and the elders of that city shall take down the heifer into a ravine with an everflowing stream, which is neither tilled nor sown,—and shall behead there the heifer in the ravine.
Then shall the priests the sons of Levi come near, for of them, hath Yahweh thy God made choice to wait upon him, and to bless in the name of Yahweh,—and at their bidding, shall be settled every controversy and every punishment;
and, all the elders of that city who are nearest unto the slain, shall bathe their hands over the heifer that hath been beheaded in the ravine,
and shall respond, and say,—Our hands, shed not this blood, neither did, our eyes, see [the deed] .
Be propitious unto thy people Israel whom thou hast redeemed, O Yahweh, and do not impute innocent blood in the midst of thy people Israel. So shall they obtain propitiation for the guilt of shedding blood.
Thou, therefore shalt consume the guilt of shedding innocent blood out of thy midst,—when thou shalt do that which is right in the eyes of Yahweh.
When thou shalt go forth to war against thine enemies,—and Yahweh thy God shall deliver them into thy hand and thou shalt take them captive;
and shalt see among the captives a woman of beautiful figure,—and shalt have a desire unto her, and wouldest take her to thee to wife,
then shalt thou bring her into the midst of thy house,—and she shall shave her head and pare her nails;
and put away the raiment of her captivity from off her, and shall remain in thy house, and bewail her father and her mother for the space of a month,—and after that, mayest thou go in unto her, and be her husband, and she shall be thy wife.
And it shall be, if thou hast no pleasure in her, then shalt thou let her go whither she will but thou shalt not sell, her for silver,—thou shalt not make merchandise of her, because thou hast humbled her.
When a man shall have two wives—the one beloved and, the other hated, and they have borne him sons, both she that is beloved, and she that is hated,—and it shall be that the firstborn son belongeth to her that is hated,
then shall it be, that in the day when he maketh his sons to inherit that which he hath, he may not treat the son of the beloved, instead of the son of the hated, as the firstborn;
but the true firstborn the son of her that is hated, shall he treat as firstborn by giving him double out of all that is found to be his,—for, he, is the beginning of his strength, his, is the right of the firstborn.
When a man hath a son, rebellious and insulting, who will not hearken to the voice of his father, and to the voice of his mother,—though they chastise him, yet will not hearken unto them,
then shall his father and his mother, lay hold of him,—and bring him forth unto the elders of his city, and unto the gate of his place;
and shall say unto the elders of his city: This our son, is rebellious and insulting,—he will not hearken unto our voice,—a glutton and a tippler.
Then shall all the men of his city stone him with stones that he die, so shalt thou consume the wicked thing out of thy midst,—and, all Israel, shall hear and fear.
But when there shall be in any man a sin worthy of death and he is to be put to death,—and thou shalt hang him on a tree,
his dead body shall not remain all night upon the tree but thou shalt bury, him on the same day, for a reproach unto God, is he that is hanged,—so shalt thou not make unclean thy soil which Yahweh thy God is giving unto thee for an inheritance.

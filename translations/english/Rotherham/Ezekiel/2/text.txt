And he said unto me,—Son of man, Stand upon thy feet, that I may, speak with thee.
Then the Spirit entered into me as soon as he spake unto me, and it caused me to stand upon my feet,—and I heard one speaking unto me.
And he said unto me- Son of man I am sending thee unto the sons of Israel, unto rebellious nations, which have rebelled against me,—they, and their fathers have transgressed against me, until this very day;
and it is unto such sons—of shameless face, and emboldened heart, that I am sending thee,—therefore shalt thou say unto them, Thus saith My Lord, Yahweh.
And they! whether they will hear or whether they will forbear, for a perverse house, they are, shall then know that, a prophet, hath been in their midst.
But thou son of man Be not afraid of them Nor of their words, be afraid Though thorns and thistles are about thee, And amongst prickly plants, thou dost dwell, Of their words, be not afraid nor At their faces, be thou dismayed, For a perverse house, they are!
Thou shalt therefore speak my words unto them, whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear For perverse, they are!
Thou, therefore son of man, hear what I am speaking unto thee., become not perverse like the perverse house,—open thy mouth, and eat that which I am giving unto thee.
So I looked, and lo! a hand put forth unto me,—and lo! therein a scroll;
and he spread it out before me, and, it was written on the front and the back,—and there were written thereon, lamentation and sighing, and wailing.

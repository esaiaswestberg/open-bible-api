And once more lifted I mine eyes, and looked,—and lo! a Flying Volume.
And he said unto me, What canst thou see? So I said, I, can see a flying volume, the length thereof, twenty by the cubit, and, the breadth thereof, ten by the cubit.
Then said he unto me, This, is the curse, which is going forth over the face of all the earth,—Because, every one who stealeth, on the one side, hath in one way been let off, and, every one who sweareth, on the other side, hath in another way been let off,
[therefore] have I brought it forth, Declareth Yahweh of hosts, And it shall enter—into the house of the thief, and into the house of him that sweareth by my name, falsely,—and it shall roost in the midst of his house, and shall consume it, both the timbers thereof, and the stones thereof.
Then came forward, the messenger who was talking with me,—and said unto me—Lift up, I pray thee, thine eyes, and see what this is which is coming forth.
And I said, What is it? Then said he, This, is an ephah that is coming forth. And he said, This, is their iniquity, throughout all the land.
And lo! a leaden disc uplifted,—and here a certain woman, sitting inside the ephah.
Then said he, This, is Lawlessness. So he thrust her back inside the ephah,—and then thrust the leaden weight into the mouth thereof.
Then lifted I up mine eyes and looked, and lo! Two Women coming forward, with the wind in their wings, and, they, had wings, like the wings of the stork,—and bare up the ephah, between the earth and the heavens.
Then said I unto the messenger who was speaking with me,—Whither are they carrying the ephah?
And he said unto me, To build for it a house in the land of Shinar,—so shall it be ready, and they shall settle it there, upon its own base?

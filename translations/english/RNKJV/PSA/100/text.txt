Make a joyful noise unto יהוה, all ye lands.
Serve יהוה with gladness: come before his presence with singing.
Know ye that יהוה he is Elohim: it is he that hath made us, and not we ourselves; we are his people, and the sheep of his pasture.
Enter into his gates with thanksgiving, and into his courts with praise: be thankful unto him, and bless his name.
For יהוה is good; his mercy is everlasting; and his truth endureth to all generations.

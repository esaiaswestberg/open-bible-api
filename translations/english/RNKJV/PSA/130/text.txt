Out of the depths have I cried unto thee, O יהוה.
יהוה, hear my voice: let thine ears be attentive to the voice of my supplications.
If thou, YAH, shouldest mark iniquities, O יהוה, who shall stand?
But there is forgiveness with thee, that thou mayest be feared.
I wait for יהוה, my soul doth wait, and in his word do I hope.
My soul waiteth for יהוה more than they that watch for the morning: I say, more than they that watch for the morning.
Let Israel hope in יהוה: for with יהוה there is mercy, and with him is plenteous redemption.
And he shall redeem Israel from all his iniquities.

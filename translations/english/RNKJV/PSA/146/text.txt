Praise ye יהוה. Praise יהוה, O my soul.
While I live will I praise יהוה: I will sing praises unto my Elohim while I have any being.
Put not your trust in princes, nor in the son of man, in whom there is no help.
His breath goeth forth, he returneth to his earth; in that very day his thoughts perish.
Joyful is he that hath the El of Jacob for his help, whose hope is in יהוה his Elohim:
Which made heaven, and earth, the sea, and all that therein is: which keepeth truth for ever:
Which executeth judgment for the oppressed: which giveth food to the hungry. יהוה looseth the prisoners:
יהוה openeth the eyes of the blind: יהוה raiseth them that are bowed down: יהוה loveth the righteous:
יהוה preserveth the strangers; he relieveth the fatherless and widow: but the way of the wicked he turneth upside down.
יהוה shall reign for ever, even thy Elohim, O Zion, unto all generations. Praise ye יהוה.

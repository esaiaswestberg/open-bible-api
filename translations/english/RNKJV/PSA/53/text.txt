The fool hath said in his heart, There is no Elohim. Corrupt are they, and have done abominable iniquity: there is none that doeth good.
Elohim looked down from heaven upon the children of men, to see if there were any that did understand, that did seek Elohim.
Every one of them is gone back: they are altogether become filthy; there is none that doeth good, no, not one.
Have the workers of iniquity no knowledge? who eat up my people as they eat bread: they have not called upon Elohim.
There were they in great fear, where no fear was: for Elohim hath scattered the bones of him that encampeth against thee: thou hast put them to shame, because Elohim hath despised them.
Oh that the salvation of Israel were come out of Zion! When Elohim bringeth back the captivity of his people, Jacob shall rejoice, and Israel shall be glad.

O יהוה, rebuke me not in thine anger, neither chasten me in thy hot displeasure.
Have mercy upon me, O יהוה; for I am weak: O יהוה, heal me; for my bones are vexed.
My soul is also sore vexed: but thou, O יהוה, how long?
Return, O יהוה, deliver my soul: oh save me for thy mercies' sake.
For in death there is no remembrance of thee: in the grave who shall give thee thanks?
I am weary with my groaning; all the night make I my bed to swim; I water my couch with my tears.
Mine eye is consumed because of grief; it waxeth old because of all mine enemies.
Depart from me, all ye workers of iniquity; for יהוה hath heard the voice of my weeping.
יהוה hath heard my supplication; יהוה will receive my prayer.
Let all mine enemies be ashamed and sore vexed: let them return and be ashamed suddenly.

Praise ye יהוה. Praise ye the name of יהוה; praise him, O ye servants of יהוה.
Ye that stand in the house of יהוה, in the courts of the house of our Elohim,
Praise יהוה; for יהוה is good: sing praises unto his name; for it is pleasant.
For YAH hath chosen Jacob unto himself, and Israel for his peculiar treasure.
For I know that יהוה is great, and that our יהוה is above all elohim.
Whatsoever יהוה pleased, that did he in heaven, and in earth, in the seas, and all deep places.
He causeth the vapours to ascend from the ends of the earth; he maketh lightnings for the rain; he bringeth the wind out of his treasuries.
Who smote the firstborn of Egypt, both of man and beast.
Who sent tokens and wonders into the midst of thee, O Egypt, upon Pharaoh, and upon all his servants.
Who smote great nations, and slew mighty kings;
Sihon king of the Amorites, and Og king of Bashan, and all the kingdoms of Canaan:
And gave their land for an heritage, an heritage unto Israel his people.
Thy name, O יהוה, endureth for ever; and thy memorial, O יהוה, throughout all generations.
For יהוה will judge his people, and he will repent himself concerning his servants.
The idols of the heathen are silver and gold, the work of men's hands.
They have mouths, but they speak not; eyes have they, but they see not;
They have ears, but they hear not; neither is there any breath in their mouths.
They that make them are like unto them: so is every one that trusteth in them.
Bless יהוה, O house of Israel: bless יהוה, O house of Aaron:
Bless יהוה, O house of Levi: ye that fear יהוה, bless יהוה.
Blessed be יהוה out of Zion, which dwelleth at Jerusalem. Praise ye יהוה.

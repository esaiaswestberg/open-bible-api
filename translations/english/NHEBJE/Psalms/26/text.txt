Judge me, Jehovah, for I have walked in my integrity. I have trusted also in Jehovah without wavering.
Examine me, Jehovah, and prove me. Try my heart and my mind.
For your loving kindness is before my eyes. I have walked in your truth.
I have not sat with deceitful men, neither will I go in with hypocrites.
I hate the assembly of evildoers, and will not sit with the wicked.
I will wash my hands in innocence, so I will go about your altar, Jehovah;
that I may make the voice of thanksgiving to be heard, and tell of all your wondrous works.
Jehovah, I love the habitation of your house, the place where your glory dwells.
Do not gather my soul with sinners, nor my life with bloodthirsty men;
in whose hands is wickedness, their right hand is full of bribes.
But as for me, I will walk in my integrity. Redeem me, and be merciful to me.
My foot stands in an even place. In the congregations I will bless Jehovah.

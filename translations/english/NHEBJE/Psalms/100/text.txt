Shout for joy to Jehovah, all you lands!
Serve Jehovah with gladness. Come before his presence with singing.
Know that Jehovah, he is God. It is he who has made us, and we are his. We are his people, and the sheep of his pasture.
Enter into his gates with thanksgiving, into his courts with praise. Give thanks to him, and bless his name.
For Jehovah is good. His loving kindness endures forever, his faithfulness to all generations.

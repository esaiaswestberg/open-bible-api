I will give you thanks with my whole heart. Before the angels, I will sing praises to you.
I will bow down toward your holy temple, and give thanks to your Name for your loving kindness and for your truth; for you have exalted your Name and your Word above all.
In the day that I called, you answered me. You encouraged me with strength in my soul.
All the kings of the earth will give you thanks, Jehovah, for they have heard the words of your mouth.
Yes, they will sing of the ways of Jehovah; for great is Jehovah's glory.
For though Jehovah is high, yet he looks after the lowly; but the proud, he knows from afar.
Though I walk in the midst of trouble, you will revive me. You will stretch forth your hand against the wrath of my enemies. Your right hand will save me.
Jehovah will fulfill that which concerns me; your loving kindness, Jehovah, endures forever. Do not forsake the works of your own hands.

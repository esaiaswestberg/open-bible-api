Praise Yah! Praise, you servants of Jehovah, praise the name of Jehovah.
Blessed be the name of Jehovah, from this time forth and forevermore.
From the rising of the sun to the going down of the same, Jehovah's name is to be praised.
Jehovah is high above all nations, his glory above the heavens.
Who is like Jehovah, our God, who has his seat on high,
Who stoops down to see in heaven and in the earth?
He raises up the poor out of the dust. Lifts up the needy from the ash heap;
that he may set him with princes, even with the princes of his people.
He settles the barren woman in her home, as a joyful mother of children. Praise Yah!

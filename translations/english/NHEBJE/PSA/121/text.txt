I will lift up my eyes to the hills. Where does my help come from?
My help comes from Jehovah, who made heaven and earth.
He will not allow your foot to be moved. He who keeps you will not slumber.
Behold, he who keeps Israel will neither slumber nor sleep.
Jehovah is your keeper. Jehovah is your shade on your right hand.
The sun will not harm you by day, nor the moon by night.
Jehovah will keep you from all evil. He will keep your soul.
Jehovah will keep your going out and your coming in, from this time forth, and forevermore.

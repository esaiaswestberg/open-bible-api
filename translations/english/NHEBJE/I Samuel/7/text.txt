The men of Kiriath Jearim came, and fetched up the ark of Jehovah, and brought it into the house of Abinadab in the hill, and sanctified Eleazar his son to keep the ark of Jehovah.
It happened, from the day that the ark stayed in Kiriath Jearim, that the time was long; for it was twenty years: and all the house of Israel lamented after Jehovah.
Samuel spoke to all the house of Israel, saying, "If you do return to Jehovah with all your heart, then put away the foreign gods and the Ashtaroth from among you, and direct your hearts to Jehovah, and serve him only; and he will deliver you out of the hand of the Philistines."
Then the children of Israel removed the Baals and the Ashtaroth, and served Jehovah only.
Samuel said, "Gather all Israel to Mizpah, and I will pray for you to Jehovah."
They gathered together to Mizpah, and drew water, and poured it out before Jehovah, and fasted on that day, and said there, "We have sinned against Jehovah." Samuel judged the children of Israel in Mizpah.
When the Philistines heard that the children of Israel were gathered together at Mizpah, the lords of the Philistines went up against Israel. When the children of Israel heard it, they were afraid of the Philistines.
The children of Israel said to Samuel, "Do not cease to cry to Jehovah our God for us, that he will save us out of the hand of the Philistines."
Samuel took a suckling lamb, and offered it for a whole burnt offering to Jehovah: and Samuel cried to Jehovah for Israel; and Jehovah answered him.
As Samuel was offering up the burnt offering, the Philistines drew near to battle against Israel; but Jehovah thundered with a great thunder on that day on the Philistines, and confused them; and they were struck down before Israel.
The men of Israel went out of Mizpah, and pursued the Philistines, and struck them, until they came under Beth Kar.
Then Samuel took a stone, and set it between Mizpah and Shen, and called its name Ebenezer, saying, "Jehovah helped us until now."
So the Philistines were subdued, and they came no more within the territory of Israel. The hand of Jehovah was against the Philistines all the days of Samuel.
The cities which the Philistines had taken from Israel were restored to Israel, from Ekron even to Gath; and Israel recovered its territory out of the hand of the Philistines. There was peace between Israel and the Amorites.
Samuel judged Israel all the days of his life.
He went from year to year in circuit to Bethel and Gilgal, and Mizpah; and he judged Israel in all those places.
His return was to Ramah, for there was his house; and there he judged Israel: and he built there an altar to Jehovah.

Where do wars and fightings among you come from? Do not they come from your pleasures that war in your members?
You lust, and do not have. You kill, covet, and cannot obtain. You fight and make war. You do not have, because you do not ask.
You ask, and do not receive, because you ask with wrong motives, so that you may spend it for your pleasures.
You adulteresses, do you not know that friendship with the world is enmity with God? Whoever therefore wants to be a friend of the world makes himself an enemy of God.
Or do you think that the Scripture says in vain, "The Spirit which He made to dwell in us yearns jealously"?
But He gives more grace. Therefore it says, "God resists the proud, but gives grace to the humble."
Be subject therefore to God. But resist the devil, and he will flee from you.
Draw near to God, and he will draw near to you. Cleanse your hands, you sinners; and purify your hearts, you double-minded.
Lament, mourn, and weep. Let your laughter be turned to mourning, and your joy to gloom.
Humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord, and he will exalt you.
Do not speak against one another, brothers. He who speaks against a brother or judges his brother, speaks against the law and judges the law. But if you judge the law, you are not a doer of the law, but a judge.
Only one is the lawgiver and judge, who is able to save and to destroy. But who are you to judge your neighbor?
Come now, you who say, "Today or tomorrow let us go into this city, and spend a year there, trade, and make a profit."
Whereas you do not know what your life will be like tomorrow. For what is your life? For you are a vapor, that appears for a little time, and then vanishes away .
For you ought to say, "If Jehovah wills, we will both live, and do this or that."
But now you glory in your boasting. All such boasting is evil.
To him therefore who knows to do good, and does not do it, to him it is sin.

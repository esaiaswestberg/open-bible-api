And Moses with the elders of Israel commanded the people, saying, Keep all the commandments which I command you this day.
And it shall be on the day when ye shall pass the Jordan unto the land which the LORD thy God gives thee that thou shalt set thee up great stones and plaster them with plaster;
And thou shalt write upon them all the words of this law when thou has passed to enter in unto the land which the LORD thy God gives thee, a land that flows with milk and honey, as the LORD God of thy fathers has said unto thee.
Therefore, it shall be when ye have passed the Jordan, [that] ye shall set up these stones, which I command you this day, in Mount Ebal, and thou shalt plaster them with plaster.
And there shalt thou build an altar unto the LORD thy God, an altar of stones; thou shalt not lift up [any] iron [tool] upon them.
Thou shalt build the altar of the LORD thy God of whole stones, and thou shalt offer burnt offerings upon it unto the LORD thy God;
and thou shalt offer peace offerings and shalt eat there and rejoice before the LORD thy God.
And thou shalt write upon the stones all the words of this law very plainly.
And Moses with the priests the Levites spoke unto all Israel, saying, Take heed and hearken, O Israel; today thou art become the people of the LORD thy God.
Thou shalt, therefore, hear the voice of the LORD thy God and do his commandments and his statutes, which I command thee this day.
And Moses charged the people the same day, saying,
These shall stand upon Mount Gerizim to bless the people when ye have passed the Jordan: Simeon, Levi, Judah, Issachar, Joseph, and Benjamin.
And these shall stand upon mount Ebal to pronounce the curse: Reuben, Gad, Asher, Zebulun, Dan, and Naphtali.
And the Levites shall speak and say unto all the men of Israel with a loud voice:
Cursed [is] the man that makes [any] graven or molten image, an abomination unto the LORD, the work of the hands of the craftsman, and puts [it] in a secret [place]. And all the people shall answer and say, Amen.
Cursed [is] he that dishonours his father or his mother. And all the people shall say, Amen.
Cursed [is] he that reduces his neighbour's border. And all the people shall say, Amen.
Cursed [is] he that makes the blind to err in the way. And all the people shall say, Amen.
Cursed [is] he that twists the rights of the stranger, the fatherless, and the widow. And all the people shall say, Amen.
Cursed [is] he that lies with his father's wife because he uncovers his father's skirt. And all the people shall say, Amen.
Cursed [is] he that lies with any manner of beast. And all the people shall say, Amen.
Cursed [is] he that lies with his sister, the daughter of his father or the daughter of his mother. And all the people shall say, Amen.
Cursed [is] he that lies with his mother-in-law. And all the people shall say, Amen.
Cursed [is] he that smites his neighbour secretly. And all the people shall say, Amen.
Cursed [is] he that takes a bribe to slay an innocent person. And all the people shall say, Amen.
Cursed [is] he that does not confirm [all] the words of this law to do them. And all the people shall say, Amen.:

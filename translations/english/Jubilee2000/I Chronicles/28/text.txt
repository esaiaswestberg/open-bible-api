And David assembled all the princes of Israel, the princes of the tribes, and the princes of the companies that ministered to the king by course, and the princes over the thousands, and princes over the hundreds, with the princes over all the substance and possession of the king, and his sons, with the officers, and with the mighty men, and with all the valiant men, unto Jerusalem.
Then David, the king, stood up upon his feet and said, Hear me, my brethren, and my people: [As for me], I [had] in my heart to build a house of rest for the ark of the covenant of the LORD and for the footstool of our God and had made ready for the building.
But God said unto me, Thou shalt not build a house for my name because thou [hast been] a man of war and hast shed blood.
However, the LORD God of Israel chose me before all the house of my father to be king over Israel for ever, for he has chosen Judah [to be] the ruler; and of the house of Judah, the house of my father; and among the sons of my father he liked me to make [me] king over all Israel;
and of all my sons (for the LORD has given me many sons) he has chosen Solomon, my son, to sit upon the throne of the kingdom of the LORD over Israel.
And he said unto me, Solomon, thy son, he shall build my house and my courts, for I have chosen him [to be] my son, and I will be his father.
Moreover, I will establish his kingdom for ever if he is constant to do my commandments and my judgments as at this day.
Now, therefore, in the sight of all Israel the congregation of the LORD and in the audience of our God, keep and seek for all the commandments of the LORD your God, that ye may possess this good land and leave [it] for an inheritance for your sons after you for ever.
And thou, Solomon, my son, know thou the God of thy father and serve him with a perfect heart and with a willing soul, for the LORD searches all hearts and understands all the imaginations of the thoughts. If thou seek him, he will be found of thee; but if thou forsake him, he will cast thee off for ever.
Take heed now, for the LORD has chosen thee to build a house for the sanctuary; be strong, and do [it].
Then David gave to Solomon, his son, the pattern of the porch and of its houses and of its treasuries and of its upper chambers and of its inner parlours and of the place of the seat of reconciliation,
and the pattern of all that he had [received] by the Spirit of the courts of the house of the LORD and of all the chambers round about, of the treasuries of the house of God and of the treasuries of the holy things;
also for the courses of the priests and the Levites, and for all the work of the ministry of the house of the LORD, and for all the vessels of ministry of the house of the LORD.
[He gave] gold by weight for that of gold, for all the vessels of each manner of service; [silver also] for all the vessels of silver by weight, for all the vessels of each service.
[Gold] by weight for the candlesticks of gold, and for their lamps of gold, by weight for every candlestick, and for its lamps; and for the candlesticks of silver by weight, [both] for the candlestick and [also] for its lamps, according to the service of each candlestick.
And by weight [he gave] gold for the tables of showbread, for each table; and, [likewise], silver for the tables of silver.
Also pure gold for the fleshhooks and the bowls and the cups, and for the golden covers [he gave gold] by weight for every basin; and [likewise silver] by weight for every basin of silver;
and for the altar of incense refined gold by weight; and gold for the pattern of the chariot of the cherubim, that spread out [their wings] and covered the ark of the covenant of the LORD.
All [this], [said David], the LORD made me understand in writing by [his] hand upon me, [even] all the works of this pattern.
And David said to Solomon, his son, Be strong and of good courage, and do [it]; fear not, nor be dismayed, for the LORD God, [even] my God, [will be] with thee; he will not leave thee, nor forsake thee, until thou hast finished all the work of the service of the house of the LORD.
Behold the courses of the priests and the Levites, in all the ministry of the house of God; [they shall be] with thee in all the work; all of them voluntarily, with wisdom in all ministry; likewise, the princes and all the people to execute all thy commands.:

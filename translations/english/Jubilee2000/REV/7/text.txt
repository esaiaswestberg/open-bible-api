And after these things I saw four angels standing upon the four corners of the earth, holding back the four winds of the earth that no wind should blow upon the earth nor upon the sea nor upon any tree.
And I saw another angel ascending from the rising of the sun, having the seal of the living God: and he cried out with a loud voice to the four angels, to whom it was given to hurt the land and the sea,
saying, Hurt not the land neither the sea nor the trees until we have sealed the servants of our God in their foreheads.
And I heard the number of those that were sealed: [and there were] sealed a hundred [and] forty-four thousand of all the tribes of the sons of Israel.
Of the tribe of Juda [were] sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of Reuben [were] sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of Gad [were] sealed twelve thousand.
Of the tribe of Aser [were] sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of Naphtali [were] sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of Manasses [were] sealed twelve thousand.
Of the tribe of Simeon [were] sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of Levi [were] sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of Issachar [were] sealed twelve thousand.
Of the tribe of Zepulun [were] sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of Joseph [were] sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of Benjamin [were] sealed twelve thousand.
After this I saw, and, behold, a great multitude, which no man could number, of all nations and kindreds and peoples and tongues stood before the throne and before the Lamb clothed with long white robes and palms in their hands
and cried with a loud voice, saying, Salvation unto him who is seated upon the throne of our God and unto the Lamb.
And all the angels stood round about the throne and [about] the elders and the four animals; and they fell upon their faces before the throne and worshipped God,
saying, Amen: The blessing and the glory and the wisdom and the thanksgiving and the honour and the power and the might, [be] unto our God for ever and ever. Amen.
And one of the elders responded and asked me, Who are these who are arrayed in long white robes? and where did they come from?
And I said unto him, lord, thou knowest. And he said to me, These are those who came out of great tribulation and have washed their long robes, and made them white in the blood of the Lamb.
Therefore, they are before the throne of God and serve him day and night in his temple, and he that is seated on the throne shall dwell among them.
They shall hunger no more neither thirst anymore; neither shall the sun be thrust upon them nor any other heat.
For the Lamb which is in the midst of the throne shall govern them and shall lead them unto living fountains of waters, and God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes.:

Now it came to pass after the death of Saul, when David was returned from the slaughter of the Amalekites, and David had abode two days in Ziklag;
it came to pass on the third day that, behold, a man came out of the camp from Saul with his clothes rent and earth upon his head, and [so] it was when he came to David, that he fell to the earth and did obeisance.
And David said unto him, Where dost thou come from? And he said unto him, I am escaped out of the camp of Israel.
And David said unto him, How went the matter? I pray thee, tell me. And he answered, The people fled from the battle, and many of the people fell and are dead, and Saul and Jonathan, his son, are dead also.
And David said unto the young man that told him, How dost thou know that Saul and Jonathan, his son, are dead?
And the young man that told him said, As I happened by chance upon Mount Gilboa, behold, Saul leaned upon his spear, and the chariots and horsemen followed hard after him.
And when he looked behind him, he saw me and called unto me. And I answered, Here [am] I.
And he said unto me, Who [art] thou? And I answered him, I [am] an Amalekite.
He said unto me again, Stand, I pray thee, upon me and slay me, for anguish is come upon me, and all my soul [is] yet in me.
So I stood upon him and slew him because I was sure that he could not live after he was fallen, and I took the crown that [was] upon his head and the bracelet that [was] on his arm and have brought them here unto my lord.
Then David took hold on his clothes and rent them and likewise all the men that [were] with him.
And they mourned and wept and fasted until evening for Saul and for Jonathan his son and for the people of the LORD, and for the house of Israel because they had fallen by the sword.
And David said unto the young man that told him, From where [art] thou? And he answered, I [am] the son of a stranger, an Amalekite.
And David said unto him, How wast thou not afraid to stretch forth thine hand to destroy the LORD'S anointed?
Then David called one of the young men and said, Go near [and] fall upon him. And he smote him that he died.
And David said unto him, Thy blood [be] upon thy head, for thy mouth has testified against thee, saying, I have slain the LORD'S anointed.
And David lamented with this lamentation over Saul and over Jonathan his son.
(He also bade them teach the sons of Judah [the use of] the bow. Behold, [it is] written in the book of righteousness.)
The glory of Israel is slain upon thy high places! How are the mighty fallen!
Tell [it] not in Gath, publish [it] not in the streets of Askelon lest the daughters of the Philistines rejoice lest the daughters of the uncircumcised triumph.
Ye mountains of Gilboa, [let there be] no dew, neither [let there be] rain, upon you nor fields of offerings, for there the shield of the mighty is vilely cast away, the shield of Saul, [as though he had] not [been] anointed with oil.
Without the blood of the slain, without the fat of the mighty, the bow of Jonathan never turned back, and the sword of Saul never returned empty.
Saul and Jonathan [were] loved and desired in their lives, and in their death they were not divided; they were swifter than eagles, they were stronger than lions.
Ye daughters of Israel, weep over Saul, who clothed you in scarlet, with [other] delights, who put ornaments of gold upon your apparel.
How are the mighty fallen in the midst of the battle! O Jonathan, [thou wast] slain in thine high places.
I am distressed for thee, my brother Jonathan; very pleasant hast thou been unto me; thy love to me was wonderful, passing the love of women.
How are the valiant fallen, and the weapons of war perished!:

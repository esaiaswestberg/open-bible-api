O that thou [wert] as my brother, that sucked the breasts of my mother! [when] I should find thee without, I would kiss thee; and I should not be despised.
I would lead thee [and] bring thee into my mother's house, that [thou] would instruct me; I would cause thee to drink of spiced wine of the juice of my pomegranate.
His left hand [should be] under my head, and his right hand should embrace me.
I charge you, O daughters of Jerusalem, that ye not awake nor stir up love until he pleases.
Who [is] she that comes up from the wilderness, leaning upon her beloved? I woke thee up under the apple tree; there thy mother had [birth] pains; there she had pains [that] brought thee into the light.
Set me as a seal upon thine heart as a sign upon thine arm; for love [is] strong as death; jealousy [is] hard as Sheol; the coals thereof [are] coals of fire, [which have a] most vehement flame.
The many waters cannot quench love, neither can the rivers drown it; if [a] man would give all the substance of his house for this love, it would certainly be despised.
We have a little sister, and she [still] has no breasts; what shall we do for our sister in the day when she shall be spoken for?
If she [is] a wall, we will build upon her a palace of silver; and if she [is] a door, we will inclose her with boards of cedar.
I [am] a wall, and my breasts like towers since I was in his eyes as the one that found peace.
Solomon had a vineyard at Baalhamon; he let out the vineyard unto keepers; for its fruit each one was to bring a thousand [pieces] of silver.
My vineyard, which [is] mine, [is] before me; the thousand [pieces] shall be thine, O Solomon, and two hundred for those that keep the fruit.
[Thou], she that dwellest in the gardens, the companions hearken to thy voice; cause me to hear [it].
Run, my beloved, and be thou like to a roe or to a young hart upon the mountains of spices.

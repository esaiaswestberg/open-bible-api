And it came to pass [that] when Jesus had finished these words, he departed from Galilee and came into the borders of Judaea beyond the Jordan;
and a great multitude followed him, and he healed them there.
Then the Pharisees came unto him, tempting him and saying unto him, Is it lawful for a man to put away his wife for any cause?
And he answered and said unto them, Have ye not read, that he who made [them] at the beginning made them male and female?
And said, For this cause shall a man leave father and mother and shall be joined to his wife, and they shall be two in one flesh.
Therefore they are no longer two, but one flesh. What therefore God has joined together, let not man separate.
They say unto him, Why did Moses then command to give a bill of divorce and to put her away?
He said unto them, Moses, because of the hardness of your hearts, suffered you to put away your wives, but from the beginning it was not so.
And I say unto you, Whosoever shall put away his wife, except [it be] for fornication and shall marry another, commits adultery, and whosoever marries her that is put away commits adultery.
His disciples say unto him, If the case of the man be so with [his] wife, it is not expedient to marry.
But he said unto them, Everyone cannot receive this word, except [those] unto whom it is given.
For there are some eunuchs who were so born from [their] mother's womb; and there are some eunuchs who were made eunuchs of men; and there are eunuchs who have made themselves eunuchs because of the kingdom of the heavens. He that is able to receive [it], let him receive [it].
Then were there brought unto him little children that he should put [his] hands on them and pray, and the disciples rebuked them.
But Jesus said, Suffer the little children to come unto me and forbid them not, for of such is the kingdom of the heavens.
And he laid [his] hands on them and departed from there.
And, behold, one came and said unto him, Good Master, what good thing shall I do that I may have eternal life?
And he said unto him, Why dost thou call me good? [There is] none good but one, [that is], God, but if thou wilt enter into life, keep the commandments.
He said unto him, Which? Jesus said, Thou shalt not murder, Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not bear false witness,
Honour thy father and [thy] mother, and, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.
The young man said unto him, All these things I have kept from my youth up; what do I lack?
Jesus said unto him, If thou desire to be perfect, go [and] sell what thou hast and give it to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven; and come [and] follow me.
But when the young man heard that word, he went away sorrowful, for he had great possessions.
Then said Jesus unto his disciples, Verily I say unto you, It is difficult that a rich man shall enter into the kingdom of the heavens.
And again I say unto you, It is easier to put a cable through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.
But his disciples hearing these things were exceedingly amazed, saying, Who then can be saved?
But Jesus beheld [them] and said unto them, With men this is impossible, but with God all things are possible.
Then Peter answered and said unto him, Behold, we have forsaken all and followed thee; what shall we have therefore?
And Jesus said unto them, Verily I say unto you, That ye who have followed me, in the regeneration when the Son of man shall sit in the throne of his glory, ye also shall sit upon twelve thrones, to judge the twelve tribes of Israel.
And every one that has forsaken houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or wife or children or lands for my name's sake shall receive a hundredfold and shall inherit eternal life.
But many [that are] first shall be last, and [many of the] last [shall be] first.:

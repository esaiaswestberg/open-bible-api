And Jesus answered and spoke unto them again by parables and said,
The kingdom of the heavens is like unto a certain man, a king, who made a marriage [feast] for his son
and sent forth his servants to call those that were invited to the wedding, and they would not come.
Again, he sent forth other servants, saying, Tell those who are invited, Behold, I have prepared my dinner; my bulls and [my] fatlings [are] killed, and all things [are] ready; come unto the marriage.
But they made light of [it] and went their ways, one to his farm, another to his merchandise,
and the others took his servants and entreated [them] spitefully and slew [them].
But when the king heard [of this], he became angry and sent forth his armies and destroyed those murderers and burned up their city.
Then he said to his servants, The wedding is ready, but those who were called were not worthy.
Go ye therefore into the entrances of the highways and call as many as ye shall find to the marriage.
So those servants went out into the highways and gathered together everyone that they found, both bad and good; and the wedding was filled with guests.
And when the king came in to see the guests, he saw there a man who did not have on a wedding garment,
and he said unto him, Friend, how didst thou come in here not having a wedding garment? And he was speechless.
Then the king said to the servants, Bind him hand and foot and take him away and cast [him] into the darkness outside; there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
For many are called, but few [are] chosen.
Then the Pharisees left and took counsel how they might entangle him in [his] word.
And they sent out unto him their disciples with those of Herod, saying, Master, we know that thou art a lover of truth and teachest the way of God with truth and that thou takest care for no [man], for thou art no respecter of persons of men.
Tell us therefore, What thinkest thou? Is it lawful to give tribute unto Caesar or not?
But Jesus perceived their wickedness and said, Why tempt ye me, [ye] hypocrites?
Show me the coin of the tribute. And they presented unto him a denarius.
And he said unto them, Whose [is] this image and superscription?
They say unto him, Caesar's. Then said he unto them, Render therefore unto Caesar the things which are Caesar's and unto God the things that are God's.
When they had heard [these words], they marvelled and left him and went away.
The same day the Sadducees came to him, who say that there is no resurrection, and asked him,
saying, Master, Moses said, If a man dies, having no children, his brother shall marry his wife and raise up seed unto his brother.
Now there were with us seven brothers, and the first, when he had married a wife, deceased, and, having no seed, left his wife unto his brother;
likewise the second also, and the third, unto the seventh.
And last of all the woman died also.
Therefore in the resurrection whose wife shall she be of the seven? for they all had her.
Then Jesus answered and said unto them, Ye do err, not knowing the scriptures nor the power of God.
For in the resurrection they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are as the angels of God in heaven.
But concerning the resurrection of the dead, have ye not read that which is spoken unto you by God, who saith,
I AM the God of Abraham and the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob? God is not the God of [the] dead, but of [the] living.
And when the multitude heard [this], they were astonished at his doctrine.
Then the Pharisees, hearing that he had put the Sadducees to silence, gathered together.
And one of them, [who was] an interpreter of the law, asked [him a question], tempting him and saying,
Master, which [is] the great commandment in the law?
Jesus said unto him, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart and with all thy soul and with all thy mind.
This is the first and great commandment.
And the second [is] like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.
On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets.
While the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus asked them,
saying, What think ye of the Christ? Whose son is he? They say unto him, [The Son] of David.
He said unto them, How then does David in Spirit call him Lord, saying,
The LORD said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand until I make thine enemies thy footstool?
If David then calls him Lord, how is he his son?
And no one was able to answer him a word, neither dared anyone from that day forth ask him any more [questions].:

Now we beseech you, brethren, regarding the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and our being gathered together unto him,
that ye not be easily shaken in understanding or be troubled neither by spirit nor by word nor by letter as from us, as if the day of Christ is at hand.
Let no one deceive you by any means: for [that day shall not come] except there come a falling away first and that man of sin be revealed, the son of perdition,
opposing and exalting himself against all that is called God, or divinity, so that he as God sits in the temple of God, making himself appear to be God.
Remember ye not, that when I was yet with you, I told you these things?
And ye know what impedes this now, that he might be revealed in his time.
For the mystery of iniquity is already working, except that he who dominates now will dominate until he is taken out of the way.
And then shall that Wicked [one] be revealed, whom the Lord shall consume with the Spirit of his mouth and remove with the clarity of his coming:
[that wicked one], who shall come by the working of Satan with great power and signs and lying miracles,
and with all deception of iniquity [working] in those that perish because they did not receive the charity of the truth, to be saved.
Therefore, for this cause, God shall send the operation of error in them, that they should believe the lie;
that they all might be condemned who did not believe the truth, but consented to the iniquity.
But we should always give thanks to God for you, brethren, beloved of the Lord, because God has from the beginning chosen you to saving health through the sanctification of the Spirit and faith in [the] truth,
unto which he called you by our gospel, to the obtaining of the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ.
Therefore, brethren, stand fast and retain the doctrine which ye have been taught, whether by word or our epistle.
Now our Lord Jesus Christ himself and God, even our Father, who has loved us and has given [us] eternal consolation and good hope through grace,
comfort your hearts and confirm you in every good word and work.:

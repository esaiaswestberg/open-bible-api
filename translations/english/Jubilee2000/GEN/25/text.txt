Then again Abraham took a wife, and her name [was] Keturah.
And she bore him Zimran, Jokshan, Medan, Midian, Ishbak, and Shuah.
And Jokshan begat Sheba and Dedan. And the sons of Dedan were Asshurim, Letushim, and Leummim.
And the sons of Midian: Ephah, Epher, Enoch, Abida, and Eldaah. All these [were] the sons of Keturah.
And Abraham gave all that he had unto Isaac.
But unto the sons of the concubines, which Abraham had, Abraham gave gifts and sent them away from Isaac his son, while he yet lived, eastward, unto the east country.
And these [were] the days of the years of Abraham's life which he lived, one hundred seventy-five years.
Then Abraham expired and died in a good old age, an old man and full [of years], and was gathered to his people.
And his sons Isaac and Ishmael buried him in the cave of Machpelah, in the field of Ephron the son of Zohar the Hittite, which [is] in front of Mamre;
the field which Abraham purchased of the sons of Heth, there was Abraham buried, and Sarah his wife.
And it came to pass after the death of Abraham, that God blessed his son Isaac; and Isaac dwelt by the well Lahairoi.
Now these [are] the generations of Ishmael, son of Abraham, whom Hagar the Egyptian, Sarah's handmaid, gave birth unto Abraham:
And these [are] the names of the sons of Ishmael, by their names, according to their lineages: the firstborn of Ishmael, Nebajoth, and Kedar, Adbeel, Mibsam,
Mishma, Dumah, Massa,
Hadar, Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah.
These [are] the sons of Ishmael, and these [are] their names, by their towns and by their palaces; twelve princes according to their families.
And these [are] the years of the life of Ishmael, one hundred thirty-seven years; and Ishmael expired and died and was gathered unto his people.
And they dwelt from Havilah unto Shur, that [is] before Egypt, as thou goest toward Assyria; [and] he fell in the presence of all his brethren.
And these [are] the generations of Isaac, son of Abraham. Abraham begat Isaac;
and Isaac was forty years old when he took Rebekah to wife, the daughter of Bethuel, the Aramean of Padanaram, the sister to Laban the Aramean.
And Isaac prayed unto the LORD for his wife because she [was] barren; and the LORD accepted him, and Rebekah his wife conceived.
And the sons struggled together within her; and she said, If [this is] so, why should I [live]? And she went to enquire of the LORD.
And the LORD said unto her, Two nations [are] in thy womb, and two [manner of] peoples shall be separated from thy bowels; and [the one] people shall be stronger than [the other] people; and the elder shall serve the younger.
And when her days to be delivered were fulfilled, behold, [there were] twins in her womb.
And the first came out red, all over like a hairy garment; and they called his name Esau.
And afterwards his brother came out with Esau's heel grasped in his hand; and his name was called Jacob. And Isaac [was] sixty years old when Rebekah gave birth to them.
And the boys grew, and Esau was a cunning hunter, a man of the field; and Jacob [was] an upright man, remaining in the tents.
And Isaac loved Esau because he ate of [his] venison; but Rebekah loved Jacob.
And Jacob boiled pottage; and Esau came from the field, and he [was] faint;
and Esau said to Jacob, Give me to eat, I pray thee, of that red [pottage]; for I [am] faint. Therefore was his name called Edom.
And Jacob said, Sell me this day thy birthright.
And Esau said, Behold, I [am] at the point to die; and what profit shall this birthright do to me?
And Jacob said, Swear to me this day; and he swore unto him and he sold his birthright unto Jacob.
Then Jacob gave Esau of the bread and of the pottage of lentils; and he ate and drank, and rose up, and went away. Thus Esau despised [his] birthright.:

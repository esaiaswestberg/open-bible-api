And the whole earth was of one language and of one speech.
And it came to pass as they journeyed from the east that they found a plain in the land of Shinar; and they dwelt there.
And they said one to another, Go to, let us make brick and burn them thoroughly. And they had brick instead of stone and slime instead of mortar.
And they said, Go to, let us build us a city and a tower whose top [may reach] unto heaven; and let us make us a name, lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth.
And the LORD came down to see the city and the tower, which the sons of the man built.
And the LORD said, Behold, the people [are] one, and they all have one language; and they begin to do this, and now nothing will be restrained from them which they have imagined to do.
Now, let us go down and there confound their language that they may not understand one another's speech.
So the LORD scattered them abroad from there upon the face of all the earth, and they left off to build the city.
Therefore the name of it was called Babel because there the LORD confounded the language of all the earth, and from there the LORD scattered them abroad upon the face of all the earth.
These [are] the generations of Shem: Shem [was] one hundred years old and begat Arphaxad two years after the flood:
And Shem lived after he begat Arphaxad five hundred years and begat sons and daughters.
And Arphaxad lived thirty-five years and begat Salah;
and Arphaxad lived after he begat Salah four hundred and three years and begat sons and daughters.
And Salah lived thirty years and begat Eber;
and Salah lived after he begat Eber four hundred and three years and begat sons and daughters.
And Eber lived thirty-four years and begat Peleg;
and Eber lived after he begat Peleg four hundred and thirty years and begat sons and daughters.
And Peleg lived thirty years and begat Reu;
and Peleg lived after he begat Reu two hundred and nine years and begat sons and daughters.
And Reu lived thirty-two years and begat Serug;
and Reu lived after he begat Serug two hundred and seven years and begat sons and daughters.
And Serug lived thirty years and begat Nahor;
and Serug lived after he begat Nahor two hundred years and begat sons and daughters.
And Nahor lived twenty-nine years and begat Terah;
and Nahor lived after he begat Terah one hundred and nineteen years and begat sons and daughters.
And Terah lived seventy years and begat Abram, Nahor, and Haran.
Now these [are] the generations of Terah: Terah begat Abram, Nahor, and Haran; and Haran begat Lot.
And Haran died before his father Terah in the land of his nature, in Ur of the Chaldees.
And Abram and Nahor took wives for themselves; the name of Abram's wife [was] Sarai, and the name of Nahor's wife, Milcah, the daughter of Haran, the father of Milcah and the father of Iscah.
But Sarai was barren; she [had] no child.
And Terah took Abram, his son, and Lot, the son of Haran, his son's son, and Sarai, his daughter-in-law, his son Abram's wife, and they went forth with them from Ur of the Chaldees to go into the land of Canaan; and they came unto Haran and dwelt there.
And the days of Terah were two hundred and five years, and Terah died in Haran.:

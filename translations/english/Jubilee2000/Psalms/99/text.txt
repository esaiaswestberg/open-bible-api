The LORD reigns; the peoples shall tremble; he who sits above the cherubim [reigns]; the earth shall be moved.
The LORD [is] great in Zion, and he [is] high above all the peoples.
Let them praise thy great and terrible name, [for] it [is] holy.
The king's strength [is] that he loves judgment; thou dost establish equity; thou dost execute judgment and righteousness in Jacob.
Exalt ye the LORD our God and worship at the footstool of his feet, [which is] holy.
Moses and Aaron [are] among his priests and Samuel among those that call upon his name; they called upon the LORD, and he answered them.
He spoke unto them in the pillar of fire; they kept his testimonies and the order [that] he gave them.
Thou didst answer them, O LORD our God; thou wast a God that didst forgive them, and [an] avenger for their works.
Exalt the LORD our God and worship at the mountain of his holiness, for the LORD our God is holy.:

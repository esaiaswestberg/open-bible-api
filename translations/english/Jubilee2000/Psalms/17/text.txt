<> Hear righteousness, O LORD, attend unto my cry, give ear unto my prayer, [that] does not [go] not out of feigned lips.
Let my sentence come forth from thy presence; let thine eyes behold uprightness.
Thou hast proved my heart; thou hast visited [me] in the night; thou hast refined me [and hast] found no iniquity; that which I thought did not pass through my mouth.
Concerning the works of men, by the word of thy lips I have observed the ways of the violent.
Sustain my steps in thy ways [that] my footsteps not slip.
I have called upon thee, because thou dost hear me, O God: incline thine ear unto me [and hear] my speech.
Show thy mercy [to be] marvellous, O Saviour of those who put their trust in thee, from those that rise up against thy right hand.
Keep me as the apple of the eye; hide me with the shadow of thy wings,
from the wicked that oppress me, [from] my deadly enemies, [who] compass me about.
They are closed in [with] their own fat; with their mouth they speak proudly.
They have now compassed us in our steps: they have set their eyes upon throwing [us] down to the earth
like as a lion [that] is greedy of his prey, and as it were a young lion lurking in secret places.
Arise, O LORD, disappoint him, cast him down: deliver my soul from the wicked, [with] thy sword;
from men, [with] thy hand, O LORD, from men of the world, [who have] their portion in [this] life and whose belly thou dost fill with thy provision: they satisfy their sons and leave the rest to their family.
As for me, I will behold thy face in righteousness; I shall be satisfied when I awake with thy likeness.:

<<To the Overcomer, A Psalm of David.>> Blessed [is] he that understands regarding the poor; the LORD will deliver him in the day of evil.
The LORD will preserve him and keep him alive, [and] he shall be blessed upon the earth, and thou wilt not deliver him unto the will of his enemies.
The LORD will strengthen him upon the bed of languishing; thou wilt soften all his bed in his sickness.
I said, LORD, be merciful unto me; heal my soul; for I have sinned against thee.
My enemies speak evil of me, When shall he die and his name perish?
And if he came to see [me], he spoke lies: his heart gathered iniquity to itself, and [when] he goes out, he tells [it].
All that hate me congregate together and murmur against me; against me do they devise my hurt.
A disease of Belial, [they say], cleaves fast unto him, and [now] that he lies he shall rise up no more.
Even the man of my peace, in whom I trusted, who ate of my bread, has lifted up [his] heel against me.
But thou, O LORD, be merciful unto me and raise me up that I may requite them.
In this I shall know that I have pleased thee, that my enemy does not triumph over me.
And as for me, thou sustained me in my integrity and hast seated me before thy face for ever.
Blessed [be] the LORD God of Israel from everlasting and to everlasting. Amen, and Amen.:

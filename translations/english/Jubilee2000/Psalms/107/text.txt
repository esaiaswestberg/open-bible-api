O give thanks unto the LORD, for [he is] good; for his mercy [endures] for ever.
Let the redeemed of the LORD say [so], whom he has redeemed from the hand of the enemy
and gathered them out of the lands, from the east and from the west, from the north and from the south.
They wandered lost in the wilderness, [alone and out of the] way; they found no city to dwell in.
Hungry and thirsty, their soul fainted in them.
Then they cried unto the LORD in their trouble, [and] he delivered them out of their distresses.
And he led them forth by the right way, that they might go to a city of habitation.
Oh that [men] would praise the LORD [for] his mercy and [for] his wonderful works unto the sons of Adam!
For he satisfies the soul that is destitute and fills the hungry soul with goodness.
Such as sat in darkness and [in the] shadow of death, [being] bound in affliction and in irons,
because they rebelled against the words of God and condemned the counsel of the most High:
Therefore he brought down their heart with labour; they fell down, and [there was] no one to help.
Then they cried unto the LORD in their trouble, [and] he saved them out of their distresses.
He brought them out of darkness and the shadow of death and broke their bonds asunder.
Oh that [men] would praise the LORD [for] his mercy and [for] his wonderful works unto the sons of Adam!
For he has broken the gates of brass and cut the bars of iron asunder.
The fools, because of the way of their rebellion, and because of their iniquities, were afflicted.
Their soul abhorred all manner of food, and they drew near unto the gates of death.
Then they cried unto the LORD in their trouble, [and] he saved them out of their distresses.
He sent his word and healed them and delivered [them] from their graves.
Oh that [men] would praise the LORD [for] his mercy and [for] his wonderful works unto the sons of Adam!
And let them offer the sacrifices of praise and publish his works with singing.
Those that go down to the sea in ships that do work in many waters,
these have seen the works of the LORD and his wonders in the deep.
For he commands and raises the stormy wind, which lifts up its waves.
They mount up to the heavens; they go down again to the depths; their soul is melted because of trouble.
They reel to and fro and stagger like a drunken man, and all of their knowledge is of no avail.
Then they cry unto the LORD in their trouble, and he delivers them out of their afflictions.
He makes the storm a calm, so that its waves are still.
Then they are glad because they are at rest; so he brings them into the haven of his will.
Oh that [men] would praise the LORD [for] his mercy and [for] his wonderful works unto the sons of Adam!
Let them exalt him also in the congregation of the people and praise him in the assembly of the elders.
He turned rivers into a wilderness and the watersprings into dry ground;
the fruitful land into salt [flats], because of the wickedness of those that dwell therein.
He turns the wilderness into reservoirs of water and dry ground into watersprings.
And there he makes the hungry to dwell, that they may prepare a city for habitation
and sow the fields and plant vineyards, which may yield fruits of increase.
He blesses them also, so that they are multiplied greatly and suffers not their cattle to decrease.
Again, they are diminished and brought low through oppression, affliction, and sorrow.
He pours contempt upon princes and causes them to wander in the wilderness, [where there is] no way.
Yet he sets the poor on high from affliction and makes [his] families like a flock.
The righteous shall see [it] and rejoice, and all iniquity shall stop her mouth.
Who [is] wise and will observe these [things] and shall understand the mercies of the LORD?:

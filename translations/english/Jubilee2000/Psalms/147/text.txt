Halelu-JAH: for [it is] good to sing praises unto our God; for praise is pleasant and beautiful.
The LORD, he who builds up Jerusalem; shall gather together the outcasts of Israel.
He heals the broken hearted, and he binds up their wounds.
He counts the number of the stars [and] calls them all by [their] names.
Great [is] our Lord and of great power; his intelligence [is] infinite.
The LORD lifts up the humble; he casts the wicked down to the earth.
Sing unto the LORD with thanksgiving; sing praise upon the harp unto our God:
Who covers the heavens with clouds, who prepares the rain for the earth, who makes grass to grow upon the mountains.
He who gives the beast his food [and] to the sons of the ravens which cry [unto him].
He does not delight in the strength of the horse; nor does he take pleasure in the legs of a man.
The LORD takes pleasure in those that fear him, in those that wait upon his mercy.
Praise the LORD, O Jerusalem; praise thy God, O Zion.
For he has strengthened the bars of thy gates; he has blessed thy sons within thee.
He who makes peace [to be] thy borders shall fill thee with the finest of the wheat.
He sends forth his word [upon] earth; his word runs very swiftly.
He who gives snow like wool scatters the hoarfrost like ashes.
He casts forth his ice like morsels; who can stand before his cold?
He shall send forth his word and melt them; his wind shall blow, and the waters shall flow.
He declares his words unto Jacob, his statutes and his judgments unto Israel.
He has not dealt so with the other nations, [which] have not known [his] judgments. Halelu-JAH.:

<> Lord, thou hast been our refuge from generation to generation.
Before the mountains were brought forth, or ever thou hadst formed the earth and the world, even from everlasting to everlasting, thou [art] God.
Thou dost turn unto man until he is broken and thou saith, Become converted, ye sons of Adam.
For a thousand years in thy sight are but as yesterday when it is past and as a watch in the night.
Thou dost cause them to pass by as the waters of a river; they are [as] a dream, which is strong in the morning like grass.
In the morning it blossoms and grows up; in the evening it is cut down and withers.
For we are consumed by thine anger, and by thy wrath we are troubled.
Thou hast set our iniquities before thee, our secret [sins] in the light of thy countenance.
For all our days decline because of thy wrath; we end our years according to the word.
The days of our years [are] seventy, and of the most valiant eighty years, yet their strength [is] labour and sorrow; for it is soon cut off, and we fly away.
Who knows the power of thine anger? that thy wrath is not less than our fear.
Cause us to learn this that we might number our days, that we may apply [our] hearts unto wisdom.
Return [unto us], O LORD, how long? and let it repent thee concerning thy servants.
O satisfy us early with thy mercy, and we shall sing and be glad all our days.
Make us glad according to the days [in which] thou hast afflicted us [and] the years [in which] we have seen evil.
Let thy work appear in thy servants and thy glory upon their sons.
And let the beauty of the LORD our God be upon us, and set thou aright the work of our hands upon us; yea, set thou aright the work of our hands.:

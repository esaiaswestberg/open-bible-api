Halelu-JAH. Praise ye the LORD from the heavens; praise him in the heights.
Praise ye him, all his angels; praise ye him, all his hosts.
Praise ye him, sun and moon; praise him, all ye stars of light.
Praise him, ye heavens of heavens and ye waters that [are] above the heavens.
Let them praise the name of the LORD; for he commanded, and they were created.
He has established them for ever and ever: he has made a law which shall not be broken.
Praise the LORD from the earth, ye dragons and all deeps,
fire and hail; snow and vapour; stormy wind fulfilling his word,
mountains and all hills; fruitful trees and all cedars,
beasts and all animals; creeping things and flying fowl,
kings of the earth and all the peoples, princes and all judges of the earth,
both young men and maidens, the old with the children,
Let them praise the name of the LORD; for his name alone is excellent; his glory [is] above earth and heavens.
[He] has exalted the horn of his people; let all his merciful ones praise him; [even] of the sons of Israel, the people near unto him. Halelu-JAH.:

<> Blessed [be] the LORD my strength, who trains my hands for the battle [and] my fingers for the war:
My mercy and my fortress; my high tower and my deliverer; my shield and [he] in whom I trust, who subdues my people under me.
LORD, what [is] man that thou knowest him? [or] the son of man, that thou esteemest him?
Man is like unto vanity; his days [are] as a shadow that passes away.
Bow thy heavens, O LORD, and come down; touch the mountains, and they shall smoke.
Cast forth lightning and scatter them; shoot out thine arrows and destroy them.
Send thine hand from above; redeem me and deliver me out of many waters, from the hand of the strange sons,
whose mouth speaks vanity, and their right hand [is] a right hand of falsehood.
I will sing a new song unto thee, O God; upon a psaltery [and] an instrument of ten strings I will sing [praises] unto thee.
[Thou], he who gives salvation unto kings, who redeems David his servant from the evil sword.
Redeem me, and save me from the hand of strange sons, whose mouth speaks vanity, and their right hand [is] a right hand of falsehood:
That our sons [may be] as plants grown up in their youth; [that] our daughters [may be] as corner stones, polished [after] the similitude of a palace;
[that] our garners [may be] full, affording all manner of store; [that] our sheep may bring forth thousands and ten thousands in our streets;
[that] our oxen [may be] strong to labour; [that there be] no breaking in nor going out; that [there be] no shout [of alarm] in our streets.
Blessed [is that] people, that is in such a case; [yea], blessed [is that] people, whose God [is] the LORD.:

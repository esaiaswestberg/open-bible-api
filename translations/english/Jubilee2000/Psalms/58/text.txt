<<To the Overcomer [upon], Do not destroy, Michtam of David.>> Do ye indeed speak righteousness, O congregation? do ye judge uprightly, O ye sons of Adam?
Yea, in heart ye work iniquity; ye weigh the violence of your hands in the earth.
The wicked are estranged from the womb; they go astray as soon as they are born, speaking lies.
Their poison [is] like the poison of a serpent; [they are] like the deaf adder [that] stops her ear,
which will not hearken to the voice of charmers, charming never so wisely.
Break their teeth, O God, in their mouth; break out the great teeth of the young lions, O LORD.
Let them melt away as waters [which] run continually; [when] he bends [his bow to shoot] his arrows, let them be as cut in pieces.
As a snail [which] melts, let [them] pass away, [like] the untimely birth of a woman, [that] they may not see the sun.
Before your pots can feel the [fire of the] thorns, he shall take them away as with a whirlwind, both living, and in [his] wrath.
The righteous shall rejoice when he sees the vengeance; he shall wash his feet in the blood of the wicked.
So that a man shall say, Verily [there is] a reward for the righteous; verily there is a God that judges in the earth.:

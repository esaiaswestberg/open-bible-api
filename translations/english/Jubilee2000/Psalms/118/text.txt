O give thanks unto the LORD; for [he is] good because his mercy [endures] for ever.
Let Israel now say that his mercy [endures] for ever.
Let the house of Aaron now say, that his mercy [endures] for ever.
Let those that fear the LORD say now, that his mercy [is] eternal.
From a tight place I called upon JAH; and JAH answered me [and set me] in a wide place.
The LORD [is] for me; I will not fear what man can do unto me.
The LORD takes my part with those that help me; therefore I shall see [my desire] upon those that hate me.
[It is] better to wait upon the LORD than to wait upon man.
[It is] better to trust in the LORD than to put confidence in princes.
All the nations compassed me about; but in the name of the LORD I will cut them off.
They compassed me about; [yea], they laid hold of me; but in the name of the LORD I will cut them off.
They compassed me about like bees; they were quenched as the fire of thorns; for in the name of the LORD I will cut them off.
Thou hast thrust at me with violence that I might fall, but the LORD helped me.
JAH [is] my strength and song and is become my saving health.
The voice of singing and saving health [is] in the tents of the righteous; the right hand of the LORD does valiantly.
The right hand of the LORD is exalted; the right hand of the LORD does valiantly.
I shall not die, but live and declare the works of JAH.
JAH has chastened me sore, but he has not given me over unto death.
Open unto me the gates of righteousness; I will go in through them; I will praise JAH.
This gate [is] of the LORD; the righteous shall enter in.
I will praise thee; for thou hast heard me and art become my saving health.
The stone [which] the builders rejected is become the head of the corner.
This is the LORD'S doing; it [is] marvellous in our eyes.
This [is] the day [which] the LORD has made; we will rejoice and be glad in it.
Save now, I beseech thee, O LORD; O LORD, I beseech thee, cause [us] now to prosper.
Blessed [be] he that comes in the name of the LORD; from the house of the LORD we bless you.
God [is] the LORD, who has shined on us; bind the sacrifice with cords, [even] unto the horns of the altar.
Thou [art] my God, and I will praise thee; [thou art] my God, I will exalt thee.
O give thanks unto the LORD; for [he is] good, for his mercy [endures] for ever.:

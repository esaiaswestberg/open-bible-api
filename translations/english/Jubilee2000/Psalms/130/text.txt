<> Out of the depths I cry unto thee, O LORD.
Lord, hear my voice; let thine ears be attentive to the voice of my supplications.
If thou, O LORD, should mark iniquities, O Lord, who shall endure?
Therefore [there is] forgiveness close to thee, that thou may be feared.
I have waited for the LORD, my soul has waited, and for his word I have waited.
My soul [has waited] for the Lord more than those that watch for the morning: [I say, more than] those that watch for the morning.
Let Israel wait for the LORD; for with the LORD [there is] mercy and plenteous redemption close to him.
And he shall ransom Israel from all his sins.:

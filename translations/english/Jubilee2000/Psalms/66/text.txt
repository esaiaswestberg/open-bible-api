<<To the Overcomer, A Song [or] Psalm.>> Make a joyful noise unto God, all the earth;
sing forth the glory of his name; put glory [into] thy praise.
Say unto God, How terrible [art thou in] thy works! Through the greatness of thy power shall thine enemies submit themselves unto thee.
All the earth shall worship thee and shall sing unto thee; they shall sing [to] thy name. Selah.
Come and see the works of God; [he is] terrible [in his] doing toward the sons of men.
He turned the sea into dry [land]; they went through the river on foot; there did we rejoice in him.
He rules by his power for ever; his eyes watch the Gentiles; the rebellious shall not exalt themselves. Selah.
O bless our God, ye peoples, and make the voice of his praise to be heard.
It is he who placed our soul into life and did not suffer our feet to slip.
For thou, O God, hast proved us; thou hast refined us as silver is refined.
Thou didst bring us into the net; thou didst lay affliction upon our loins.
Thou hast placed [a] man over our head; we went through fire and through water, but thou didst bring us out into abundance.
I will go into thy house with burnt offerings; I will pay thee my vows,
which my lips have uttered and my mouth has spoken when I was in trouble.
I will offer unto thee burnt sacrifices of fatlings with the incense of rams; I will offer bullocks with goats. Selah.
Come [and] hear, all ye that fear God, and I will declare what he has done unto my soul.
I cried unto him with my mouth, and he was extolled with my tongue.
If I regard iniquity in my heart, the Lord will not hear [me]:
[But] verily God has heard [me]; he has attended to the voice of my prayer.
Blessed [be] God, who has not turned away my prayer nor his mercy from me.:

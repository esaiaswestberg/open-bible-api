<<To the Overcomer: A Psalm for the sons of Korah.>> O clap your hands, all ye people; shout unto God with the voice of triumph.
For the LORD most high [is] terrible; [he is] a great King over all the earth.
He shall guide the peoples under us, and the Gentiles under our feet.
He shall choose our inheritance for us, the excellency of Jacob whom he loved. Selah.
God is gone up with a shout of joy, the LORD with the sound of the shofar.
Sing [praises] to God, sing [praises]; sing [praises] unto our King, sing [praises].
For God [is] the King of all the earth; sing ye [praises] with understanding.
God reigns over the Gentiles; God sits upon the throne of his holiness.
The princes of the peoples have joined the people of the God of Abraham; for the shields of the earth [belong] unto God; he is greatly exalted.:

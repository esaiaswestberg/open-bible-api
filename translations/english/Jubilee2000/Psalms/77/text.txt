<<To the Overcomer, to Jeduthun, A Psalm of Asaph.>> I cried unto God with my voice, [even] unto God with my voice; and [he] gave ear unto me.
In the day of my trouble I sought the Lord; my sore bled in the night and ceased not; my soul refused to be comforted.
I remembered God and cried out; I complained, and my spirit was overwhelmed. Selah.
Thou didst hold my eyelids open; I am broken and did not speak.
I have considered the days from the beginning, the years of the ages.
I call to remembrance my songs of the night; I commune with my own heart, and my spirit made diligent search.
Will the Lord cast off for ever? and will he be favourable no more?
Is his mercy gone for ever? does [his] word fail from generation to generation?
Has God forgotten to have mercy? has he in anger shut up his tender mercies? Selah.
And I said, This [is] my infirmity, [but I will remember] the years of the right hand of the most High.
I remembered the works of JAH; therefore I shall remember thy wonders of old.
I meditated also on all thy works and spoke of thy doings.
Thy way, O God, [is] in holiness; who [is so] great a God as [our] God?
Thou [art] the God that doest wonders; thou hast declared thy strength among the peoples.
Thou hast with [thine] arm redeemed thy people, the sons of Jacob and Joseph. Selah.
The waters saw thee, O God, the waters saw thee; they were afraid; the depths also were troubled.
The clouds poured out floods of waters; the heavens thundered; thy bolts [of lightning] also went forth.
The voice of thy thunder [was] all around; the lightnings lightened the world; the earth trembled and shook.
Thy way [was] in the sea, and thy path in the great waters, and thy footsteps were not known.
Thou didst lead thy people like a flock by the hand of Moses and Aaron.:

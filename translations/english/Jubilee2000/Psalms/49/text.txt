<<To the Overcomer, A Psalm for the sons of Korah.>> Hear this, all [ye] people; give ear, all [ye] inhabitants of the world:
Both low and high, rich and poor, together.
My mouth shall speak wisdom; and the meditation of my heart intelligence.
I will incline mine ear to a parable; I will declare my enigma upon the harp.
Why should I fear in the days of adversity [when] the iniquity of my heels shall compass me about?
Those that trust in their wealth and boast themselves in the multitude of their riches;
none [of them] can by any means ransom his brother, nor give God an atonement for him;
(for the redemption of their soul [is] of great price, and they shall never pay [it])
that he should still live for ever [and] not see corruption.
For he sees [that] all the wise men die, likewise the fool and the ignorant perish and leave their wealth to others.
Their inward thought [is] [that] their houses are eternal [and] their dwelling places to all generations; they call [their] lands after their own names.
Nevertheless man will not abide [forever] in honour; he is like the beasts [that] are cut off.
This their way [is] their folly; yet their posterity approve their sayings. Selah.
Like sheep they are laid in Sheol; death shall feed on them, and the upright shall have dominion over them in the morning, and their beauty shall be consumed in the grave from their dwelling.
Surely God will ransom my soul from the hand of Sheol when he shall take me. Selah.
Be not thou afraid when one is made rich, when the glory of his house is increased;
for in his death he shall carry nothing away; nor shall his glory descend after him.
Though while he lives, his life shall be blessed: and [men] will praise thee when thou art prosperous.
He shall enter into the generation of his fathers; they shall never see light forever.
Man [that is] in honour that does not understand is like the beasts [that] are cut off.:

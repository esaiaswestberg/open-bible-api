Why do the Gentiles rage, and the peoples imagine a vain thing?
The kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers take counsel together, against the LORD and against his anointed, [saying],
let us break their bands asunder and cast away their cords from us.
He that sits in the heavens shall laugh: the Lord shall have them in derision.
Then he shall speak unto them in his wrath and trouble them in his sore displeasure.
Yet I have set my king upon Zion, the mountain of my holiness.
I will declare the decree; the LORD hath said unto me, Thou [art] my Son; this day I have begotten thee.
Ask of me, and I shall give [thee] the Gentiles [for] thine inheritance and [unto] the uttermost parts of the earth [for] thy possession.
Thou shalt break them with a rod of iron; thou shalt dash them in pieces like a potter's vessel.
Understand now therefore, O ye kings: receive chastening, ye judges of the earth.
Serve the LORD with fear, and rejoice with trembling.
Kiss the Son lest he be angry, and ye perish [from] the way when his wrath is kindled in a little [while]. Blessed [are] all those that put their trust in him.:

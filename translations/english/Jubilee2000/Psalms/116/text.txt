I love the LORD, because he has heard my voice [and] my supplications.
Because he has inclined his ear unto me, therefore I will call upon [him] all of my days.
The sorrows of death compassed me and the pains of Sheol found me; I encountered trouble and sorrow.
Then I called upon the name of the LORD, [saying], O LORD, I beseech thee, deliver my soul.
Gracious [is] the LORD, and righteous; [yea], our God [is] merciful.
The LORD preserves the simple; I was brought low, and he saved me.
Return unto thy rest, O my soul, for the LORD has dealt bountifully with thee.
For thou hast delivered my soul from death, mine eyes from tears, [and] my feet from falling.
I will walk before the LORD in the land of the living.
I believed, therefore I spoke, and was greatly afflicted;
I said in my haste, All men [are] liars.
What shall I render unto the LORD [for] all his benefits toward me?
I will take the cup of saving health and invoke the name of the LORD.
I will pay my vows unto the LORD now in the presence of all his people.
Precious in the sight of the LORD [is] the death of his merciful ones.
[This is] so, O LORD, because I [am] thy servant; I [am] thy servant, the son of thine handmaid; thou hast loosed my bonds.
I will offer unto thee the sacrifice of praise and will invoke the name of the LORD.
I will pay my vows unto the LORD now in the presence of all his people,
in the courts of the LORD'S house, in the midst of thee, O Jerusalem. Halelu-JAH.:

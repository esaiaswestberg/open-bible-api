<> I will lift up mine eyes unto the mountains, from whence cometh my help.
My help [comes] from the LORD, who made the heavens and earth.
He will not suffer thy foot to be moved; he that keeps thee will not slumber.
Behold, he that keeps Israel shall neither slumber nor sleep.
The LORD [is] thy keeper: the LORD [is] thy shade upon thy right hand.
The sun shall not smite thee by day, nor the moon by night.
The LORD shall preserve thee from all evil; he shall preserve thy soul.
The LORD shall preserve thy going out and thy coming in from this time forth, and even for evermore.:

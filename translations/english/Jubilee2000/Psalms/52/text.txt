<<To the Overcomer, Maschil, [A Psalm] of David, when Doeg the Edomite came and told Saul, and said unto him, David is come to the house of Ahimelech.>> Why dost thou boast of evil, O strong man? The mercy of God is day by day.
Thy tongue devises wickedness like a sharp razor, working deceitfully.
Thou dost love evil more than good; [and] lying rather than to speak righteousness. Selah.
Thou dost love all devouring words, O [thou] deceitful tongue.
God shall likewise cast thee down for ever; he shall cut thee off and pluck thee out of [thy] dwelling place and root thee out of the land of the living. Selah.
The righteous also shall see and fear and shall laugh at him, saying:
Behold, [this is] the man [that] did not make God his strength, but trusted in the abundance of his riches [and] strengthened himself in his wickedness.
But I [am] like a green olive tree in the house of God; I trust in the eternal mercy of God for ever.
I will praise thee for ever because thou hast done [it], and I will wait on thy name, for [it is] good before thy merciful ones.:

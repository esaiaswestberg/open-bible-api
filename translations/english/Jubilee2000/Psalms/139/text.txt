<<To the Overcomer, A Psalm of David.>> O LORD, thou hast searched me and known [me].
Thou knowest my sitting down and my rising up, thou dost understand my thoughts from afar.
Thou hast girded my walk and my rest, and hast prepared all my ways.
For the word [is] not even upon my tongue, [and], behold, O LORD, thou dost know it altogether.
Thou hast formed my face and my insides and laid thine hand upon me.
[Thy] knowledge [is] wonderful beyond my ability to comprehend; it is high, I cannot understand it.
Where shall I go from thy spirit? or where shall I flee from thy presence?
If I ascend to the heavens, thou [art] there: if I make my bed in Sheol, behold, thou [art there].
[If] I take the wings of the dawn [and] dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea,
even there shall thy hand lead me, and thy right hand shall hold me.
If I say, Surely the darkness shall cover me; even the night shall shine because of me.
Even the darkness does not hide from thee; but the night shines as the day; the darkness is as the light.
For thou hast possessed my kidneys: thou hast covered me in my mother's womb.
I will praise thee; for I am fearfully [and] wonderfully made; marvellous [are] thy works, and [that], my soul knows right well.
My body was not hid from thee, even though [I] was made in secret [and] brought together in the lowest parts of the earth.
Thine eyes did see my substance yet being imperfect; and in thy book all [my members] were written, [which] were then formed, without [lacking] one of them.
Therefore, how precious are thy thoughts unto me, O God! How great is the sum of them!
[If] I should count them, they are more in number than the sand; when I awake, I am still with thee.
Surely thou wilt slay the wicked, O God; depart from me therefore, ye bloodthirsty men.
For they speak against thee wickedly, [and] thine enemies take [thy name] in vain.
Do I not hate [all] those, O LORD, that hate thee? and am not I grieved with those that rise up against thee?
I hate them with perfect hatred; I count them mine enemies.
Search me, O God, and know my heart; try me and know my thoughts
and see if [there be any] wicked way in me, and lead me in the way eternal.:

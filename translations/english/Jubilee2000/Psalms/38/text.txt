<> O LORD, rebuke me not in thy wrath: neither chasten me in thy hot displeasure.
For thine arrows stick fast in me, and thy hand presses me sore.
[There is] no soundness in my flesh because of thine anger; neither [is there any] rest in my bones because of my sin.
For my iniquities are gone over my head; as a heavy burden they are too heavy for me.
My wounds stink [and] are corrupt because of my foolishness.
I am troubled; I am bowed down greatly; I go mourning all the day long.
For my loins are filled with a loathsome [disease], and [there is] no soundness in my flesh.
I am feeble and sore broken; I roar by reason of the disquietness of my heart.
Lord, all my desire [is] before thee, and my groaning is not hid from thee.
My heart pants, my strength fails me; as for the light of my eyes, it also is gone from me.
My friends and my companions stand aloof from my sore, and my kinsmen stand afar off.
Those that seek after my life lay snares [for me], and those that seek my hurt speak calamities and imagine deceits all the day long.
But I, as a deaf [man, that] heard not, and as a dumb man [that] did not open his mouth.
Thus I was as a man that does not hear, and in whose mouth [are] no reproofs.
For thee, O LORD, do I wait; thou wilt respond, O Lord my God.
For I said, Let them not rejoice over me; let them not magnify [themselves] against me when my foot slips.
For I [am] ready to halt, and my sorrow [is] continually before me.
Therefore I will declare my iniquity; I will be sorry for my sin.
For my enemies [are] alive, [and] they are strong, and those that hate me wrongfully are multiplied;
rendering evil for good they are against me because I follow [that which is] good.
Forsake me not, O LORD; O my God, be not far from me.
Make haste to help me, O Lord my salvation.:

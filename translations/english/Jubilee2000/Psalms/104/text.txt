Bless the LORD, O my soul. O LORD my God, thou art very great; thou art clothed with honour and majesty,
who dost cover [thyself] with light as [with] a garment, who stretchest out the heavens like a curtain,
who dost establish his chambers between the waters, who makes the clouds his chariot, who walks upon the wings of the wind,
who makes his angels spirits, his ministers a flaming fire,
[who] laid the foundations of the earth, [that] it should not be moved by any age.
Thou didst cover it with the deep as [with] a garment; the waters stood above the mountains.
At thy rebuke they fled; at the voice of thy thunder they hasted away.
The mountains were exposed; they descended through the valleys unto the place which thou hast founded for them.
Thou hast set a bound that they may not pass over, that they not turn again to cover the earth.
[Thou art] he who sends the springs into the valleys, [which] run among the mountains.
They give drink to every beast of the field; the wild asses quench their thirst.
Next to them the fowls of the heavens have their habitation; [they] sing among the leaves.
He waters the mountains from his chambers; the earth is satisfied with the fruit of thy works.
He causes the hay to grow for the cattle and grass for the service of man, that he may bring forth bread out of the earth
and wine [that] makes glad the heart of man, making [his] face to shine with oil and bread [which] sustains man's heart.
The trees of the LORD are satisfied; the cedars of Lebanon, which he has planted,
that the birds may make their nests there: the stork makes her house [among] the fir trees.
The high mountains [are] a refuge for the wild goats, [and] the rocks for the conies.
He appointed the moon for times [and seasons]; the sun knows his going down.
Thou makest darkness, and it is night, wherein all the beasts of the forest move.
The young lions roar after their prey and seek their food from God.
The sun arises, they withdraw and lay themselves down in their dens.
Man goes forth unto his work and to his labour until the evening.
O LORD, how manifold are thy works! in wisdom thou hast made them all; the earth is full of thy riches.
[So is] this great and wide sea, wherein [are] innumerable creeping things, both small and great beasts.
There go the ships; [there is] that leviathan, [whom] thou didst make to play therein.
These wait all upon thee, that thou may give [them] their food in due season.
Thou givest unto them, they gather; thou openest thine hand, they are filled with good.
Thou hidest thy face, they are troubled; thou takest away their spirit, they cease to exist and return to their dust.
Thou sendest forth thy spirit, they are created; and thou renewest the face of the earth.
Let the glory of the LORD endure for ever; let the LORD rejoice in his works.
He looks on the earth, and it trembles: he touches the mountains, and they smoke.
I will sing unto the LORD as long as I live; I will sing praise to my God while I have my being.
My meditation of him shall be sweet; I will be glad in the LORD.
Let the sinners be consumed out of the earth, and let the wicked be no more. Bless thou the LORD, O my soul. Halelu- JAH ([Praise ye the LORD]).:

<<To the Overcomer upon Shoshannim, A testimony of Asaph: A Psalm.>> Give ear, O Shepherd of Israel, thou that leadest Joseph like a flock; thou that dwellest [between] the cherubim, shine forth.
In the presence of Ephraim and Benjamin and Manasseh stir up thy strength and come [and] save us.
Turn us again, O God, and cause thy face to shine; and we shall be saved.
O LORD God of the hosts, how long wilt thou be angry against the prayer of thy people?
Thou dost feed them with the bread of tears and give them tears to drink in [great] measure.
Thou dost make us a strife unto our neighbours, and our enemies laugh [at us] among themselves.
Turn us again, O God of the hosts, and cause thy face to shine; and we shall be saved.
Thou hast brought a vine out of Egypt; thou hast cast out the Gentiles and planted it.
Thou didst prepare [room] before it and didst cause it to take deep root, and it filled the earth.
The hills were covered with the shadow of it, and its boughs [were like] the cedars of God.
She sent out her boughs unto the sea and her branches unto the river.
Why hast thou [then] broken down her hedges, so that all those who pass by the way pluck her?
The boar out of the wood wastes it, and the wild beast of the field devours it.
Return, we beseech thee, O God of the hosts: look down from heaven and behold and visit this vine
and the vineyard which thy right hand has planted and the branch [that] thou didst make strong for thyself.
[It is] burned with fire; [it is] cut down; they perish at the rebuke of thy countenance.
Let thy hand be upon the man of thy right hand, upon the son of man [whom] thou didst make strong for thyself,
so we will not go back from thee. Thou shalt quicken us, and we will call upon thy name.
Turn us again, O LORD God of the hosts, cause thy face to shine; and we shall be saved.:

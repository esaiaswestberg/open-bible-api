<<To the Overcomer upon Sheminith, A Psalm of David.>> Help, LORD; for the merciful man ceases, for the faithful fail from among the children of men.
Each one speaks vanity with his neighbour: they speak [with] flattering lips [and] with a double heart.
The LORD shall cut off all flattering lips [and] the tongue that speaks proud things:
Who have said, With our tongue we will prevail; our lips [are] our own: who [is] lord over us?
For the oppression of the poor, for the sighing of the needy, now I will arise, saith the LORD; I will set in safety the one whom [the wicked one] has ensnared.
The words of the LORD [are] pure words: as silver tried in a furnace of earth, purified seven times.
Thou shalt keep them, O LORD, thou shalt preserve them from this generation for ever.
The wicked press in on every side when the vilest men are exalted.:

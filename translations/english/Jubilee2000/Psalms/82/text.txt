<> God stands in the congregation of the mighty; he judges among the gods.
How long will ye judge unjustly and accept the persons of the wicked? Selah.
Do right concerning the poor and fatherless; do justice to the poor and destitute.
Deliver the poor and destitute; deliver [them] out of the hand of the wicked.
They do not know, neither do they understand; they walk in darkness; they move all the foundations of the earth.
I have said, Ye [are] gods; and all of you [are] sons of the most High.
But ye shall die like men and fall like one of the tyrants.
Arise, O God, judge the earth, for thou shalt inherit all the Gentiles.:

<<[A Psalm] of David.>> I will praise thee with my whole heart: before the gods I will sing praises unto thee.
I will worship the temple of thy holiness and praise thy name above thy mercy and thy truth; for thou hast made thy name [to be] magnificent [and raised up] thy [spoken] word above all things.
In the day when I called, thou didst answer me [and] strengthen me [with] strength in my soul.
All the kings of the earth shall praise thee, O LORD, when they hearken unto the [spoken] words from thy mouth.
[Yea], they shall sing in the ways of the LORD: for great [is] the glory of the LORD.
For the LORD, [who is] high [and lifted up], looks upon the humble, but the proud he does not know.
Though I walk in the midst of trouble, thou wilt revive me; thou shalt stretch forth thy hand against the wrath of my enemies, and thy right hand shall save me.
The LORD will perfect [that which] concerns me; thy mercy, O LORD, [endures] for ever; forsake not the works of thine own hands.:

<<To the Overcomer, A Psalm of David.>> The heavens declare the glory of God; and the firmament shows the work of his hands.
[One] day provides a word for the [next] day, and [one] night declares wisdom unto the [next] night.
[There is] no speech nor language, [where] their voice is not heard.
Their line is gone out through all the earth, and their words to the end of the world. In them he has set a tabernacle for the sun,
which [is] as a bridegroom coming out of his chamber [and] rejoices as a strong man to run a race.
His going forth [is] from the end of the heavens, and his circuit unto the ends of it: and there is nothing hid from the heat thereof.
The law of the LORD [is] perfect, converting the soul; the testimony of the LORD [is] sure, making wise the simple.
The statutes of the LORD are right, rejoicing the heart; the commandment of the LORD [is] pure, enlightening the eyes.
The fear of the LORD [is] clean, enduring for ever; the rights of the LORD [are] true, they are all just.
More to be desired [are they] than gold, than much fine gold; sweeter also than honey and the honeycomb.
Moreover by them is thy servant warned, [and] in keeping them [there is] great reward.
Who can understand [his] errors? cleanse thou me from secret [faults].
Keep back thy servant also from pride [and arrogance]; let them not have dominion over me; then I shall be perfect, and I shall be innocent of the great rebellion.
Let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be acceptable in thy sight, O LORD, my strength, and my redeemer.:

<> O sing unto the LORD a new song; for he has done marvellous things; his right hand has gotten him the victory, even the arm of his holiness.
The LORD has made known his saving health; he has openly showed his righteousness in the sight of the Gentiles.
He has remembered his mercy and his truth toward the house of Israel; all the ends of the earth have seen the saving health of our God.
Sing with joy unto the LORD, all the earth; lift up thy voice and rejoice and sing praises.
Sing praises unto the LORD with the harp, with the harp and the voice of a song.
With trumpets and [the] sound of [the] shofar make a joyful noise before the LORD, the King.
Let the sea roar and the fullness thereof, the world and those that dwell therein.
Let the rivers clap [their] hands; let the mountains be joyful together
before the LORD; for he has come to judge the earth; with righteousness he shall judge the world and the peoples with equity.:

<> Make a joyful noise unto the LORD all the earth.
Serve the LORD with gladness; come before his presence with joy.
Know ye that the LORD he [is] God; [it is] he [that] has made us and not we ourselves; [we are] his people and the sheep of his pasture.
Enter into his gates with thanksgiving [and] into his courts with praise; be thankful unto him [and] bless his name.
For the LORD [is] good; his mercy [is] everlasting; and his truth [endures] to all generations.:

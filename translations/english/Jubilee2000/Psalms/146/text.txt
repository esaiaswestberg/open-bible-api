Halelu-JAH. Praise the LORD, O my soul.
In my life I will praise the LORD; I will sing praises unto my God while I live.
Put not your trust in princes, [nor] in son of man in whom [there is] no salvation.
His spirit shall go forth, he shall return to his earth; in that very day all his thoughts shall perish.
Happy [is he] who [has] the God of Jacob for his help, whose hope [is] in the LORD his God;
who made the heavens and the earth, the sea and all that [is] therein; who keeps truth for ever:
He who does justice unto the oppressed; who gives bread to the hungry. The LORD looses the prisoners:
The LORD opens [the eyes of] the blind; the LORD raises those that are bowed down; the LORD loves the righteous:
The LORD preserves the strangers; he raises up the fatherless and widow; but the way of the wicked he turns upside down.
The LORD shall reign for ever, [even] thy God, O Zion, from generation to generation. Halelu-JAH.:

And I saw another mighty angel come down from heaven, clothed with a cloud; and a rainbow [was] upon his head, and his face was as the sun, and his feet as pillars of fire:
And he had in his hand a little open book, and he set his right foot upon the sea and [his] left [foot] upon the land
And cried out with a loud voice as [when] a lion roars; and when he had cried out, seven thunders uttered their voices.
And when the seven thunders had uttered their voices, I was about to write, and I heard a voice from heaven, saying unto me, Seal up those things which the seven thunders have spoken and do not write them.
And the angel whom I saw standing upon the sea and upon the land lifted up his hand to heaven
and swore by him that lives for ever and ever, who created the heaven and the things that are therein, and the earth, and the things that are therein, and the sea and the things which are therein, that there should be time no longer;
but in the day of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the trumpet, the mystery of God shall be finished, as he did evangelize unto his servants the prophets.
And the voice which I heard from heaven spoke unto me again and said, Go [and] take the little book which is open in the hand of the angel who stands upon the sea and upon the land.
And I went unto the angel and said unto him, Give me the little book. And he said unto me, Take [it], and eat it up; and it shall make thy belly bitter, but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey.
And I took the little book from the angel's hand and ate it up; and it was in my mouth sweet as honey: and as soon as I had eaten it, my belly was bitter.
And he said unto me, Thou must prophesy again as to many peoples and nations and tongues and kings.:

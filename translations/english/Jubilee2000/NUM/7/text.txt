And it came to pass on the day that Moses had fully set up the tabernacle and had anointed it and sanctified it with all its vessels; likewise having anointed and sanctified the altar, with all its vessels;
that the princes of Israel, heads of the houses of their fathers, who [were] the princes of the tribes, and were over those that were numbered, offered;
and they brought their offerings before the LORD, six covered wagons and twelve oxen: a wagon for each two of the princes and for each one an ox, which they offered before the tabernacle.
And the LORD spoke unto Moses, saying,
Take [it] from them, and it shall be for the service of the tabernacle of the testimony; and thou shalt give them unto the Levites, to each one according to his ministry.
Then Moses received the wagons and the oxen, and gave them unto the Levites.
Two wagons and four oxen he gave unto the sons of Gershon, according to their ministry;
and four wagons and eight oxen he gave unto the sons of Merari, according to their ministry, under the hand of Ithamar, the son of Aaron the priest.
But unto the sons of Kohath he gave none; because the ministry of the sanctuary belonging unto them [was that] they should bear upon their shoulders.
And the princes offered at the dedication of the altar the day that it was anointed; even the princes offered their offering before the altar.
And the LORD said unto Moses, They shall offer their offering, each prince on his day, at the dedication of the altar.

My son, keep my words, and lay up my commandments with thee.
Keep my commandments, and live; and my law as the apple of thine eye.
Bind them upon thy fingers; write them upon the tablet of thine heart.
Say unto wisdom, Thou [art] my sister, and call understanding [thy] kinswoman:
That they may keep thee from the woman belonging to someone else, from the stranger [who] flatters with her words.
For at the window of my house I looked through my casement
and beheld among the simple ones, I discerned among the youths, a young man void of understanding,
passing through the street near her corner; and he went the way to her house,
in the twilight, in the evening, in the black and dark night;
and, behold, a woman met him [with] the attire of a harlot, and subtil of heart.
(She [is] loud and stubborn; her feet do not abide in her house:
Now without, now in the streets, [she] lies in wait at every corner.)
So she caught him and kissed him [and] with an impudent face said unto him,
I had promised sacrifices of peace; today I have payed my vows.
Therefore I came forth to meet thee, diligently to seek thy face, and I have found thee.
I have decked my bed with coverings of tapestry, with carved [works], with fine linen of Egypt.
I have perfumed my bed with myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon.
Come, let us take our fill of love until the morning; let us solace ourselves with loves.
For the husband [is] not at home; he is gone a long journey:
He has taken a bag of money with him [and] will come home at the [appointed] feast day.
With her much fair speech she caused him to yield; with the flattering of her lips she persuaded him.
He went after her straightway, as an ox goes to the slaughter or as a fool to the correction of the stocks,
until the arrow pierces through his liver. [He is] as a bird struggling in the snare and not knowing that it [is] against his own life.
Hearken unto me now therefore, O ye sons, and attend to the words of my mouth.
Let not thine heart decline to her ways; do not go astray in her paths.
For she has caused many to fall down dead; [yea], all the strong [men] have been slain by her.
Her house [is] the way to Sheol, going down to the chambers of death.:

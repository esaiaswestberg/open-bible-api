Doth not wisdom cry, and give her voice to intelligence?
She stands in the top of high places, by the way at the crossroads of the paths.
She cries at the gates, at the entry of the city, at the coming in at the doors.
Unto you, O men, I call; and my voice [is] to the sons of men.
O ye simple, understand prudence; and, ye fools, be ye of an understanding heart.
Hear, for I will speak of excellent things, and the opening of my lips [shall be] right things.
For my mouth shall speak truth, and wickedness [is] an abomination to my lips.
All the words of my mouth [are] in righteousness; [there is] nothing perverse or twisted in them.
They [are] all plain to him that understands and right to those that have found wisdom.
Receive my chastening and not silver, and knowledge rather than choice gold.
For wisdom [is] better than precious stones; and all the things that may be desired are not to be compared to it.
I, wisdom, dwell with prudence, and [I] invent the knowledge of [giving] counsel.
The fear of the LORD [is] to hate evil; pride, arrogancy, the evil way, and the perverse mouth, do I hate.
With me is counsel, and existence; I [am] understanding; strength belongs to me.
By me the kings reign, and the princes decree justice.
By me the princes rule, and all of the governors judge the earth.
I love those that love me, and those that seek me [early] shall find me.
Riches and honour [are] with me, [yea], durable riches and righteousness.
My fruit [is] better than gold, [yea], than precious stones, and my revenue than choice silver.
I [shall] lead in the way of righteousness in the midst of the paths of judgment,
that I may cause my friends to inherit existence and I will fill their treasures.
The LORD possessed me in the beginning of his way, before his works of old.
I was [set up] with eternal dominion, from the beginning, before the earth [was].
I was begotten before the depths, before the existence of the fountains of many waters.
Before the mountains were founded, before the hills was I begotten.
While as yet [he] had not made the earth nor the fields nor the beginning of the dust of the world,
when [he] composed the heavens, I [was] there. When he set a compass upon the face of the depth,
when [he] established the clouds above, when [he] strengthened the fountains of the deep,
when he gave to the sea his decree that the waters should not pass his commandment, when he appointed the foundations of the earth,
I was with him ordering everything; I was his delight every day, being content before him at all times;
I am content in the circumference of his earth, and my contentment is with the sons of men.
Now therefore hearken unto me, O ye sons; for blessed [are those that] keep my ways.
Hearken unto chastening, and be wise; refuse it not.
Blessed [is] the man that hears me, keeping vigil at my gates, waiting at the threshold of my doors.
For whosoever finds me shall find life and shall obtain the will of the LORD.
But he that sins against me wrongs his own soul; all those that hate me love death.:

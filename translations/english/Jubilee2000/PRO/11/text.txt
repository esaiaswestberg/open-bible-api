A false balance [is] abomination to the LORD, but a just weight [is] his delight.
[When] pride comes, then comes shame, but with the humble [is] wisdom.
The perfection of the upright shall guide them in the way, but the perverseness of transgressors shall destroy them.
Riches shall not profit in the day of wrath, but righteousness shall deliver from death.

The righteousness of the upright shall deliver them, but transgressors shall be imprisoned in [their own] sin.
When the wicked man dies, [his] hope perishes, and the hope of unjust [men] shall perish.
The righteous is delivered out of the tribulation, and the wicked takes his place.
The hypocrite with [his] mouth destroys his neighbour, but the just are delivered with wisdom.
When it goes well with the righteous, the city rejoices, and when the wicked perish, [there are] feasts.
By the blessing of the upright the city is exalted, but it is overthrown by the mouth of the wicked.
He that is void of understanding despises his neighbour, but the intelligent man remains silent.
A talebearer reveals secrets, but he that is of a faithful spirit conceals the matter.
When intelligence is lacking, the people shall fall, but in the multitude of counsellors [there is] salvation.
With anxiety shall he that is surety for a stranger be afflicted, and he that hates suretyship shall live securely.
The gracious woman retains honour, and strong [men] retain riches.
The merciful man does good to his own soul, but the cruel [man] troubles his own flesh.
The wicked works a deceitful work, but to him that sows righteousness [shall be] a sure reward.
As righteousness [is] unto life, so he that pursues evil [pursues it] unto his own death.
They that are of a perverse heart [are an] abomination to the LORD, but [such as are] perfect in [their] way [are] his delight.
No matter how many covenants he has made with death, the wicked shall not be absolved, but the seed of the righteous shall escape.
[As] a gold ring in a swine's snout, [so is] a fair woman which is without discretion.
The desire of the righteous [is] only good, [but] the hope of the wicked [is] wrath.
There are [those who] scatter, and more is added unto [them]; and [there are those who] withhold more than is just, but [come] to poverty.
The soul who is a blessing [unto others] shall be made fat, and he that fills shall be filled also himself.
He that withholds the grain, the people shall curse him, but blessing [shall be] upon the head of him that sells [it].
He that seeks good early shall find favour, but unto him that seeks evil, [it] shall come upon him.
He that trusts in his riches shall fall, but the righteous shall flourish as a branch.
He that troubles his own house shall inherit the wind, and the fool [shall be] servant to the wise of heart.
The fruit of the righteous [is a] tree of life, and he that wins souls [is] wise.
The righteous shall certainly be recompensed in the earth; how much more the wicked and the sinner!:

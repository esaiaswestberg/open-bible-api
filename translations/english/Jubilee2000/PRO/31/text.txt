The words of king Lemuel, the prophecy with which his mother taught him.
What, my son? and what, the son of my womb? and what, the son of my vows?
Do not give thy strength nor thy ways unto the women who destroy kings.
[It is] not for kings, O Lemuel, [it is] not for kings to drink wine; nor is beer for princes
lest they drink and forget the law and pervert the judgment of any of the afflicted.
Give beer unto him that is ready to perish and wine unto those that have heavy hearts.
They drink and forget their need and remember their misery no more.
Open thy mouth for those who cannot speak in the judgment of all the sons of death.
Open thy mouth, judge righteously, and plead the cause of the poor and destitute.
[Aleph] Who can find a valiant woman? for her price [is] far above precious stones.
[Beth] The heart of her husband safely trusts in her, so that he shall have no need of spoil.
[Gimel] She will do him good and not evil all the days of her life.
[Daleth] She sought wool and flax and worked willingly with her hands.
[He] She was like the merchants' ships; she brings her food from afar.
[Vau] She rose up even at night and gave food to her family and a portion to her maidens.
[Zain] She considered the inheritance and bought it; with the fruit of her hands she planted a vineyard.
[Cheth] She girded her loins with strength and strengthened her arms.
[Teth] She perceived that her merchandise [was] good; her fire did not go out by night.
[Jod] She laid her hands to the spindle, and her hands held the distaff.
[Caph] She stretched out her hand to the poor; [yea], she reached forth her hands to the destitute.
[Lamed] She shall not be afraid of the snow for her family, for all her family [is] clothed with double garments.
[Mem] She makes herself tapestries; her clothing [is] of fine linen and purple.
[Nun] Her husband is known in the gates when he sits among the elders of the land.
[Samech] She made fine linen and sold [it] and delivered girdles unto the merchant.
[Ain] Strength and glory [is] her clothing, and she shall laugh in the last day.
[Pe] She opened her mouth with wisdom, and the law of mercy [is] upon her tongue.
[Tzaddi] She looks well to the ways of her household and does not eat bread in idleness.
[Koph] Her sons rose up and called her blessed; her husband [also], and he praised her.
[Resh] Many daughters have done valiantly, but thou dost excel them all.
[Schin] Grace [is] deceitful, and beauty [is] vain, [but] the woman that fears the LORD shall be praised.
[Tau] Give her of the fruit of her hands, and let her own works praise her in the gates.:

In the tenth year, in the tenth [month], in the twelfth [day] of the month, the word of the LORD came unto me, saying:
Son of man, set thy face against Pharaoh king of Egypt and prophesy against him, and against all Egypt.
Speak and say, Thus hath the Lord GOD said: Behold, I [am] against thee, Pharaoh king of Egypt, the great dragon that lies in the midst of his rivers, who has said, My river [is] my own, and I have made [it] for myself.
But I will put hooks in thy jaws, and I will cause the fish of thy rivers to stick unto thy scales, and I will bring thee up out of the midst of thy rivers, and all the fish of thy rivers shall come out stuck onto thy scales.
And I will leave thee [thrown] into the wilderness, thee and all the fish of thy rivers; thou shalt fall upon the open fields; thou shalt not be brought together, nor gathered; I have given thee for food to the beasts of the field and to the fowls of the heaven.
And all the inhabitants of Egypt shall know that I [am] the LORD, because they have been a staff of reed to the house of Israel.
When they took hold of thee by thy hand, thou didst break and rend all their shoulder: and when they leaned upon thee, thou didst brake and make all their loins to come to nothing.
Therefore thus hath the Lord GOD said: Behold, I bring a sword upon thee and will cut off man and beast out of thee.
And the land of Egypt shall be made desolate and waste; and they shall know that I [am] the LORD: because he hath said, The river [is] mine, and I have made [it].
Behold, therefore I [am] against thee and against thy rivers, and I will make the land of Egypt utterly waste [and] desolate, from the tower of Syene even unto the border of Ethiopia.
No foot of man shall pass through it, nor foot of beast shall pass through it, neither shall it be inhabited forty years.
And I will make the land of Egypt desolate in the midst of the countries [that are] desolate, and her cities among the cities [that are] laid waste shall be desolate forty years: and I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations and will disperse them through the countries.
Yet thus hath the Lord GOD said: At the end of forty years I will gather the Egyptians from the peoples where they were scattered.
And I will turn to bring [again] the captives of Egypt and will cause them to return [into] the land of Pathros into the land of their habitation, and there they shall be a minor kingdom.
In comparison with the other kingdoms it shall be humble; neither shall it exalt itself any more above the nations: for I will diminish them that they shall no longer rule among the Gentiles.
And it shall no longer be the confidence of the house of Israel, which brings [their] iniquity to remembrance, when they shall look after them, but they shall know that I [am] the Lord GOD.
And it came to pass in the twenty-seventh year, in the first [month], in the first [day] of the month, the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,
Son of man, Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon caused his army to serve a great service against Tyre; every head [was] made bald, and every shoulder [was] peeled: and yet neither he nor his army had wages of Tyre, for the service that he had served against her.
Therefore thus hath the Lord GOD said; Behold, I give the land of Egypt unto Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon; and he shall take her multitude and gather her spoil and take her prey; and it shall be the wages for his army.
I have given him the land of Egypt [for] his labour with which he served against her because they wrought for me, said the Lord GOD.
In that time I will cause the horn of the house of Israel to bud forth, and I will give thee the opening of the mouth in the midst of them; and they shall know that I [am] the LORD.:

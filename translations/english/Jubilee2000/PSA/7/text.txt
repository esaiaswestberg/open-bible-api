<<Shiggaion of David, which he sang unto the LORD, concerning the words of Cush the Benjamite.>> O LORD my God, in thee I have put my trust: save me from all those that persecute me, and deliver me
Lest they take my soul, as a lion dismembers [his prey] when [there is] none to deliver.
O LORD my God, if I have done this: if there is iniquity in my hands,
if I have rewarded evil unto him that was at peace with me, then let my persecutor escape without retribution.
Let the enemy persecute my soul, and take [it]; let him tread down my life upon the earth and lay my honour in the dust. Selah.
Arise, O LORD, in thine anger; lift up thyself because of the rage of mine enemies: and awake the judgment in my favour [that] thou hast commanded.
So shall the congregation of the people compass thee about, for their sakes therefore return thou on high.
The LORD shall judge the people: judge me, O LORD, according to my righteousness and according to the integrity [that is] in me.
Let wickedness consume the wicked; but establish the just: for the righteous God is he who tries the hearts and kidneys.
My shield [is] in God, he who saves the upright in heart.
God is he who judges the righteous, and God is angry [with the wicked] every day.
If he does not turn, he will whet his sword; he has bent his bow and made it ready.
He has also prepared for him the weapons of death; he ordains his arrows against the persecutors.
Behold, he travails with iniquity and has conceived [of his own] work and brought forth falsehood.
He made a pit and deepened it and shall fall into the ditch [which] he made.
His work shall return upon his own head, and his violent dealing shall come down upon his own pate.
I will praise the LORD according to his righteousness and will sing praise to the name of the LORD most high.:

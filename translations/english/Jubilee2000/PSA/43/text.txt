Judge me, O God, and plead my cause against those who are not merciful; O deliver me from the deceitful and unjust man.
For thou [art] the God of my strength; why dost thou cast me off? Why do I go mourning because of the oppression of the enemy?
O send out thy light and thy truth; let them lead me; let them bring me unto the mountain of thy holiness and to thy tabernacles.
Then I will enter in to the altar of God, unto the God [of] my exceeding joy; yea, upon the harp will I praise thee, O God my God.
Why art thou cast down, O my soul? and why art thou disquieted within me? Wait for God, for I shall yet praise him, [who is] the saving health of my countenance and my God.:

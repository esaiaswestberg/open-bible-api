<> The LORD said unto my Lord, Sit thou at my right hand until I make thine enemies thy footstool.
The LORD shall send the rod of thy strength out of Zion; rule thou in the midst of thine enemies.
Thy people [shall be] willing in the day of thy power, in the beauty of holiness; [as] the dew [which falls] from the womb of the morning, thus shall those who are thine be born unto thee.
The LORD has sworn and will not repent, Thou [art] a priest for ever after the order of Melchizedek.
The Lord at thy right hand shall smite the kings in the day of his wrath.
He shall judge among the Gentiles; he shall fill their [places] with [dead] bodies; he shall wound the head over much [of the] earth.
He shall drink of the brook in the way; therefore he shall lift up [his] head.:

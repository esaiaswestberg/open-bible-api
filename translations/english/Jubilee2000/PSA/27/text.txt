<<[A Psalm] of David.>> The LORD [is] my light and my salvation; whom shall I fear? the LORD [is] the strength of my life; of whom shall I be afraid?
When the wicked, [even] my enemies and my foes, came upon me to eat up my flesh, they stumbled and fell.
Though a host should encamp against me, my heart shall not fear; though war should rise against me, in this [will] I [be] confident.
One [thing] have I desired of the LORD, that will I seek after: that I may dwell in the house of the LORD all the days of my life to behold the beauty of the LORD and to enquire in his temple.
For in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his tabernacle; in the secret of his tent shall he hide me; he shall set me high upon a rock.
And now shall my head be lifted up above my enemies round about me; therefore I will offer sacrifices of joy in his tabernacle; I will sing, [yea], I will sing praises unto the LORD.
Hear, O LORD, [when] I cry with my voice: have mercy also upon me and answer me.
My heart has spoken [unto me] from thee, Seek my face. Thy face, O LORD, will I seek.
Hide not thy face [far] from me; put not thy servant away in anger: thou hast been my help; do not leave me or forsake me, O God of my saving health.
For my father and my mother have left me, and the LORD has taken me up.
Teach me thy way, O LORD, and lead me in a right path because of my enemies.
Deliver me not over unto the will of my enemies: for false witnesses are risen up against me and such as breathe out cruelty.
[I had fainted] unless I had believed to see the goodness of the LORD in the land of the living.
Wait for the LORD: be of good courage, and he shall strengthen thine heart; wait, I say, for the LORD.:

<> O God, my heart is fixed; I will sing and give praise; this is my glory.
Awake, psaltery and harp; I will awake the dawn.
I will praise thee, O LORD, among the peoples, and I will sing praises unto thee among the nations.
For thy mercy [is] great above the heavens, and thy truth [reaches] unto the heavens.
Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens and thy glory above all the earth;
that thy beloved may be delivered: save [with] thy right hand, and answer me.
God has spoken in his holiness; I will rejoice, I will divide Shechem and mete out the valley of Succoth.
Gilead [shall be] mine; Manasseh [shall be] mine; Ephraim also [shall be] the strength of my head; Judah [shall be] my lawgiver;
Moab [shall be] my washpot; over Edom I will cast my shoe; over Philistia I will triumph.
Who will bring me into the strong city? who will lead me into Edom?
Surely thou, O God, [who] had cast us off and did not, O God, go forth with our hosts.
Give us help from trouble; for the salvation of man is deception.
Through God we shall do valiantly, for he shall tread down our enemies [again].:

<<To the Overcomer: Maschil, for the sons of Korah.>> As the hart pants after the water brooks, so does my soul pant after thee, O God.
My soul thirsts for God, for the living God; when shall I come and appear before God?
My tears have been my food day and night, while they continually say unto me, Where [is] thy God?
I will remember these [things]; I will pour out my soul in me. When I shall be included in the number; I will go with them to the house of God with voice of joy and praise, dancing [in] the multitude.
Why art thou cast down, O my soul? and [why] art thou disquieted against me? Wait thou for God, for I shall yet praise him [for] the wellbeing of his presence.
O my God, my soul is cast down within me; therefore I will remember thee from the land of Jordan, and of the Hermonites, from the mountain of Mizar.
Deep calls unto deep at the voice of thy waterspouts; all thy waves and thy billows are gone over me.
[Yet] the LORD will command his mercy in the daytime, and in the night his song [shall be] with me, [and] my prayer unto the God of my life.
I will say unto God, My rock, why hast thou forgotten me? Why do I go mourning because of the oppression of the enemy?
[It is] as death in my bones when my enemies reproach me; while they say daily unto me, Where [is] thy God?
Why art thou cast down, O my soul? and why art thou disquieted within me? Wait thou for God, for I shall yet praise him, [who is] the saving health of my countenance and my God.:

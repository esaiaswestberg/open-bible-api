<<To the Overcomer upon Gittith, A Psalm for the sons of Korah.>> How amiable [are] thy habitations, O LORD of the hosts!
My soul longs, and even faints for the courts of the LORD; my heart and my flesh sing to the living God.
Even the sparrow has found a house and the swallow a nest for herself, where she may lay her young upon thine altars, O LORD of the hosts, my King and my God.
Happy [are] those that dwell in thy house; they shall continually praise thee. Selah.
Happy [is] the man whose strength [is] in thee, in whose heart [are] thy ways,
[who] passing through the valley of Baca, shall make it a well; the rain also shall fill the pools.
They go forth in a great multitude; and in order, they shall see God in Zion.
O LORD God of the hosts, hear my prayer; give ear, O God of Jacob. Selah.
Behold, O God our shield and look upon the face of thine anointed,
for a day in thy courts [is] better than a thousand [outside of them]. I would rather be a doorkeeper in the house of my God than to dwell in the tents of wickedness.
For the LORD God [is] a sun and shield [unto us]; the LORD will give grace and glory; he will not withhold good from those that walk uprightly.
O LORD of the hosts, happy [is] the man that trusts in thee.:

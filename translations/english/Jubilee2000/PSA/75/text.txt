<<To the Overcomer upon, Do not destroy, A Psalm [or] Song of Asaph.>> Unto thee, O God, do we give thanks, [unto thee] do we give thanks, for [that] thy name is near, thy wondrous works declare.
When I shall receive the congregation, I will judge uprightly.
The earth and all its inhabitants are dissolved; I bore up the pillars of it. Selah.
I said unto the fools, Do not deal foolishly and to the wicked, Do not lift up the horn:
Do not lift up your horn on high; speak [not with] a stiff neck.
For promotion [comes] neither from the east, nor from the west, nor from the desert.
But God [is] the judge; he puts down one and sets up another.
For the cup is in the hand of the LORD, and the wine is red; it is full of mixture; and he pours out of the same; yea, the dregs thereof, shall wring out and swallow up all the wicked of the earth.
But I will declare for ever; I will sing praises to the God of Jacob.
And I will cut off all the horns of the wicked, [but] the horns of the righteous shall be exalted.:

<<To the Overcomer, A Psalm of David.>> How long wilt thou forget me, O LORD? for ever? how long wilt thou hide thy face from me?
How long shall I take counsel in my soul, [having] sorrow in my heart daily? how long shall my enemy be exalted over me?
Consider [and] hear me, O LORD my God: lighten mine eyes lest I sleep the [sleep of] death,
lest mine enemy say, I have prevailed against him; [and] those that trouble me rejoice when I am moved.
But I have trusted in thy mercy; my heart shall rejoice in thy salvation.
I will sing unto the LORD because he has dealt bountifully with me.:

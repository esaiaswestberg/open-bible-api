<<[A Psalm] of David.>> Bless the LORD, O my soul, and all that is within me, [bless] the name of his holiness.
Bless the LORD, O my soul, and forget not all his benefits:
Who forgives all thine iniquities; who heals all thy diseases;
who redeems thy life from destruction; who crowns thee with mercy and compassion;
who satisfies thy mouth with good [things] [so that] thy youth is renewed like the eagle's.
The LORD executes righteousness and justice unto all that suffer violence.
He made known his ways unto Moses, his acts unto the sons of Israel.
The LORD [is] merciful and gracious, slow to anger, and plenteous in mercy.
He will not always chide, neither will he keep [his anger] for ever.
He has not dealt with us after our sins, nor rewarded us according to our iniquities.
For as the heavens are high above the earth [so] does he increase his mercy over those that fear him.
As far as the east is from the west, [so] far has he removed our rebellions from us.
Like as a father has mercy upon [his] children, [so] the LORD has mercy upon those that fear him.
For he knows our frame; he remembers that we [are] dust.
As [for] man, his days [are] as grass; as an open flower of the field, so he blossoms.
For the wind passes over it, and it is gone, and its place shall know it no more.
But the mercy of the LORD [is] from everlasting to everlasting upon those that fear him, and his righteousness unto the children's children,
to such as keep his covenant and to those that remember his commandments to do them.
The LORD has prepared his throne in the heavens, and his kingdom rules over all.
Bless the LORD, ye his angels, valiant and strong, that do his commandments, hearkening unto the voice of his word.
Bless ye the LORD, all [ye] his hosts, [ye] ministers of his, that do his pleasure.
Bless the LORD, all his works in all places of his dominion: bless the LORD, O my soul.:

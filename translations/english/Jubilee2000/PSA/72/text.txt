<<[A Psalm] for Solomon.>> Give the king thy judgments, O God, and thy righteousness unto the king's son.
He shall judge thy people with righteousness and thy poor with judgment.
The mountains shall bring peace to the people and the little hills by righteousness.
He shall judge the poor of the people; he shall save the children of the destitute and shall break in pieces the violent.
They shall fear thee along with the sun and before the moon throughout all generations.
He shall come down like rain upon the mown grass as the dew [that] waters the earth.
In his days shall righteousness flourish and abundance of peace until [there is] no [longer any] moon.
He shall have dominion also from sea to sea and from the river unto the ends of the earth.
Those that dwell in the wilderness shall bow before him, and his enemies shall lick the dust.
The kings of Tarshish and of the isles shall bring presents; the kings of Sheba and Seba shall offer gifts.
[Yea], all kings shall fall down before him; all Gentiles shall serve him.
For he shall deliver the destitute when he cries and the poor that has no helper.
He shall have mercy on the poor and destitute and shall save the souls of the poor [in spirit].
He shall redeem their soul from deceit and violence, and precious shall their blood be in his sight.
And he shall live, and to him shall be given of the gold of Sheba; prayer also shall be made for him continually; [and] daily he shall be given blessings.
There shall be [planted] a handful of grain in the earth upon the tops of the mountains; its fruit shall thunder like Lebanon; and [out] of the city [they] shall blossom like the grass of the earth.
His name shall endure for ever; before the sun his name shall be disseminated, and all Gentiles shall be blessed in him; they shall call him blessed.
Blessed [be] the LORD God, the God of Israel, [the] only one [who] does wondrous things
And blessed [be] his glorious name for ever, and let the whole earth be filled [with] his glory; Amen, and Amen.

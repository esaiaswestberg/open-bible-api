<<To the Overcomer, A Psalm of David.>> Deliver me, O LORD, from the evil man; preserve me from the man of Violence.
Who devise evil in [their] heart; they are continually gathered together [for] war.
They have sharpened their tongue like a serpent; adders' poison [is] under their lips. Selah.
Keep me, O LORD, from the hands of the wicked; preserve me from the man of violence, who have purposed to overthrow my steps.
The proud have hid a snare for me and cords; they have spread a net; on the path they have set snares for me. Selah.
I said unto the LORD, Thou [art] my God: hear the voice of my supplications, O LORD.
O GOD the Lord, the strength of my saving health, cover thou my head in the day of battle.
Grant not, O LORD, the desires of the wicked; do not further his [wicked] thought [lest] they exalt themselves. Selah.
[As for] the head of those that compass me about, let the perversion of their own lips cover them.
Let burning coals fall upon them; let them be cast into the fire, into deep pits, that they not rise up again.
The man [with an evil] tongue shall not be established in the earth; evil shall hunt the man of violence to overthrow [him].
I know that the LORD will effect the judgment of the poor [and] the judgment of the destitute.
Surely the righteous shall give thanks unto thy name; the upright shall dwell in thy presence.:

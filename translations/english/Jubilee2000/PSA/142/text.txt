<<Maschil of David; A Prayer when he was in the cave.>> I shall cry unto the LORD with my voice; with my voice shall I ask the LORD for mercy.
I shall pour out my complaint before him; before him I shall tell of my trouble.
When my spirit was overwhelmed within me, then thou didst know my path. In the way in which I walked have they secretly laid a snare for me.
I looked on [my] right hand, and beheld, but [there was] no one that would know me; I had no refuge; no one cared for my soul.
I cried unto thee, O LORD; I said, Thou [art] my hope [and] my portion in the land of the living.
Attend unto my cry, for I am brought very low; deliver me from my persecutors; for they are stronger than I.
Bring my soul out of prison, that I may praise thy name; the righteous shall feast with me; when thou shalt have weaned me.:

O LORD God, to whom vengeance belongs; O God, to whom vengeance belongs, show thyself.
Lift up thyself, thou judge of the earth: render a reward to the proud.
LORD, how long shall the wicked, how long shall the wicked triumph?
[How long] shall they utter [and] speak hard things? [and] all the workers of iniquity boast themselves?
They break in pieces thy people, O LORD, and afflict thy heritage.
They slay the widow and the stranger and murder the fatherless.
Yet they say, JAH shall not see, neither shall the God of Jacob regard [it].
Understand, ye carnal [ones] among the people, and, [ye] fools, when will ye be wise?
He that planted the ear, shall he not hear? he that formed the eye, shall he not see?
He that chastens the Gentiles, shall he not correct? he that teaches man knowledge, [shall not he know]?
The LORD knows the thoughts of man, that they [are] vanity.
Blessed [is] the man whom thou dost chasten, O JAH, and teach him out of thy law,
to cause him to rest in the days of adversity, until the pit is dug for the wicked.
For the LORD will not cast off his people, neither will he forsake his inheritance.
But the judgment shall be returned unto righteousness, and all the upright in heart shall follow it.
Who will rise up for me against the evildoers? [or] who will stand up for me against the workers of iniquity?
Unless the LORD [had been] my help, my soul would have quickly dwelt [with] the dead.
When I said, My foot slips, thy mercy, O LORD, held me up.
In the multitude of my thoughts within me, thy comforts delight my soul.
Shall the throne of iniquity have fellowship with thee, who creates toil under [the guise of] law?
They gather [themselves together] as an army against the life of the righteous and condemn the innocent blood.
But the LORD is my refuge, and my God [is] the rock of my trust.
And he shall bring upon them their own iniquity and shall cut them off in their own wickedness; [yea], the LORD our God shall cut them off.:

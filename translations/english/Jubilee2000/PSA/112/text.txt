[Aleph] Halelu-JAH. Blessed [is] the man [that] fears the LORD, [Beth that] delights greatly in his commandments.
[Gimel] His seed shall be mighty upon earth; [Daleth] the generation of the upright shall be blessed.
[He] Wealth and riches [shall be] in his house; [Vau] and his righteousness endures for ever.
[Zain] A light has shined in the darkness upon the upright: [Cheth] Gracious and merciful and righteous.
[Teth] A good man has mercy and lends; [Jod] He will govern his affairs with [good] judgment.
[Caph] Surely he shall not be moved for ever; [Lamed] the righteous shall be in eternal remembrance.
[Mem] He shall not be afraid of evil rumours; [Nun] his heart is fixed, trusting in the LORD.
[Samech] His heart [is] established; he shall not be afraid, [Ain] until he sees [his desire] upon his enemies.
[Pe] He has dispersed; he has given to the poor; [Tzaddi] his righteousness endures for ever; [Koph] his horn shall be exalted in glory.
[Resh] The wicked shall see [it] and be furious; [Schin] he shall gnash with his teeth and waste away: [Tau] The desire of the wicked shall perish.:

<> O God, the Gentiles are come into thine inheritance; they have defiled the temple of thy holiness; they have laid Jerusalem on heaps.
The dead bodies of thy servants they have given [to be] food unto the fowls of the heavens, the flesh of thy saints unto the beasts of the earth.
They have shed their blood like water round about Jerusalem, and [there was] no one to bury [them].
We are reproached by our neighbours, scorned, and derided by those that are round about us.
How long, LORD? wilt thou be angry for ever? shall thy jealousy burn like fire?
Pour out thy wrath upon the Gentiles that do not know thee and upon the kingdoms that do not call upon thy name.
For they have devoured Jacob and laid waste his dwelling place.
O remember not against us former iniquities; let thy tender mercies speedily meet us on the way, for we are very poor.
Help us, O God, our saving health, for the honor of thy name and deliver us and purge away our sins, for thy name's sake.
Why should the Gentiles say, Where [is] their God? let him be known among the Gentiles in our sight [by] the revenging of the blood of thy servants [which is] shed.
Let the sighing of the prisoners come before thee; according to the greatness of thy power preserve those that are appointed to die
and render unto our neighbours sevenfold into their bosom their reproach, with which they have reproached thee, O Lord.
So we thy people and sheep of thy pasture will give thee thanks for ever: from generation to generation we will sing thy praises.:

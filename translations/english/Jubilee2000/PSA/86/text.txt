<> Bow down thine ear, O LORD, hear me, for I [am] poor and needy.
Preserve my soul; for I [am] merciful, O thou my God, save thy servant that trusts in thee.
Be merciful unto me, O Lord, for I cry unto thee daily.
Rejoice the soul of thy servant, for unto thee, O Lord, do I lift up my soul.
For thou, Lord, [art] good and ready to forgive and plenteous in mercy unto all those that call upon thee.
Give ear, O LORD, unto my prayer and attend to the voice of my supplications.
In the day of my trouble I will call upon thee, for thou wilt answer me.
Among the gods [there is] none like unto thee, O Lord, neither is there any other who does thy works.
All the Gentiles whom thou hast made shall come and humble themselves before thee, O Lord; and shall glorify thy name.
For thou [art] great and doest wondrous things; thou alone [art] God.
Teach me thy way, O LORD; I will walk in thy truth; firm up my heart that I might fear thy name.
I will praise thee, O Lord my God, with all my heart, and I will glorify thy name for evermore.
For great [is] thy mercy upon me, and thou hast delivered my soul from the lowest [part of] Sheol.
O God, the proud are risen against me, and the assemblies of violent [men] have sought after my soul and have not set thee before them.
But thou, O Lord, [art] a merciful and gracious God, longsuffering and plenteous in mercy and truth.
O look into me and have mercy upon me; give thy strength unto thy servant and keep the son of thine handmaid.
Show me a token for good that those who hate me may see [it] and be ashamed because thou, O LORD, hast helped me and comforted me.:

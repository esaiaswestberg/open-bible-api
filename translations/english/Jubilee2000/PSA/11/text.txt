<<To the Overcomer, A [Psalm] of David.>> I put my trust in the LORD put I: how say ye to my soul, Flee [as] a bird to your mountain?
For, behold, the wicked bend [their] bow; they make ready their arrow upon the string that they may secretly shoot at the upright in heart.
The foundations shall be destroyed. What has the righteous done?
The LORD [is] in the temple of his holiness, the LORD'S throne [is] in heaven: his eyes behold, his eyelids try the children of men.
The LORD tries the righteous, but the wicked and he that loves violence his soul hates.
Upon the wicked he shall rain snares, fire and brimstone, with winds of whirlwinds: [this shall be] the portion of their cup.
For the righteous LORD loves righteousness; his countenance beholds the upright.:

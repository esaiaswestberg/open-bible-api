<<To the Overcomer upon Muthlabben, A Psalm of David.>> I will praise [thee], O LORD, with my whole heart; I will tell of all thy marvellous works.
I will be glad and rejoice in thee: I will sing praise to thy name, O thou most High
because my enemies are turned back; they shall fall and perish at thy presence.
For thou hast accomplished my judgment and my cause; thou didst sit in the throne judging [according to] righteousness.
Thou hast reprehended the Gentiles, thou hast destroyed the wicked, thou hast put out their name for ever and ever.
O thou enemy, destructions are come to a perpetual end: and the cities that thou hast destroyed; their memorial is perished with them.
But the LORD shall endure for ever; he has prepared his throne for judgment.
And he shall judge the world in righteousness, he shall judge the peoples in uprightness.
The LORD also will be a refuge to the humble, a refuge for the time of trouble.
And those that know thy name will put their trust in thee: for thou, O LORD, hast not forsaken those that seek thee.
Sing unto the LORD, he who dwells in Zion; declare among the people his doings.
When he makes requirement for blood, he remembers them; he does not forget the cry of the humble.
Have mercy upon me, O LORD; consider my trouble [which I suffer] from those that hate me, thou that liftest me up from the gates of death:
that I may show forth all thy praise in the gates of the daughter of Zion: I will rejoice in thy saving health.
The Gentiles are sunk down in the pit [that] they made: in the net which they hid their own foot is taken.
The LORD is known [by] the judgment [which] he has executed; the wicked is snared in the work of his own hands. Higgaion ([meditate on this for ever]). Selah.
The wicked shall be put into Sheol, all the Gentiles that forget God.
For the humble shall not always be forgotten: the hope of the poor shall [not] perish for ever.
Arise, O LORD; let not man prevail: let the Gentiles be judged in thy sight.
Put fear into them, O LORD: [that] the Gentiles may know themselves [to be but] men. Selah.:

<<To the Overcomer, to Jeduthun, A Psalm of David.>> Only in God does my soul rest; from him [comes] my saving health.
He only [is] my rock and my saving health; [he is] my defence; I shall not be greatly moved.
How long will ye imagine mischief against a man? Shall ye murder each other [until ye are] as a bowing wall [and as] a tottering fence?
They only consult to cast [him] down from his greatness; they delight in lies; they bless with their mouth, but they curse in their inward parts. Selah.
My soul, rest thou only in God, for my hope [is] from him.
He only [is] my rock and my saving health; [he is] my defence; I shall not be moved.
In God [is] my saving health and my glory; the rock of my strength [and] my refuge [is] in God.
Wait in him at all times; [ye] peoples, pour out your heart before him; God [is] our refuge. Selah.
Surely the sons of Adam [are] vanity, [and] the sons of nobles [are] a lie; to be laid in the balance, they [are] altogether [lighter] than vanity.
Trust not in violence and become not vain in the taking of spoil; if riches increase, set not your heart [upon them].
God has spoken once; twice have I heard this that power [belongs] unto God.
Also unto thee, O Lord, [belongs] mercy, for thou renderest to every man according to his work.:

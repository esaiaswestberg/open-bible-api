And the famine [was] sore in the land.
And it came to pass when they had eaten up the wheat which they had brought out of Egypt, their father said unto them, Go again, buy us a little food.
And Judah spoke unto him, saying, The man did solemnly protest unto us, saying, Ye shall not see my face unless your brother [is] with you.
If thou wilt send our brother with us, we will go down and buy thee food:
But if thou wilt not send [him], we will not go down; for the man said unto us, Ye shall not see my face unless your brother [is] with you.
And Israel said, Why did ye such evil unto me [as] to tell the man that ye had another brother?
And they said, The man asked us expressly of our state and of our kindred, saying, [Is] your father yet alive? Have ye [another] brother? And we told him according to the tenor of these words. Could we certainly know that he would say, Bring your brother down?
Then Judah said unto Israel, his father, Send the lad with me, and we will arise and go, that we may live, and not die, both we and thou [and] also our little ones.
I will be surety for him; of my hand shalt thou require him; if I do not bring him unto thee and set him before thee, then let me bear the sin for ever;
for if we had not lingered, surely by now we would have returned this second time.
Then their father Israel answered them, If [it must be] so now, do this: take of the best fruits of the land in your vessels and take the man a present, a little balm, and a little honey, aromas, and myrrh, nuts, and almonds.
And take double money in your hands and the money that was brought again in the mouth of your sacks; carry [it] again in your hand; peradventure it [was] an oversight.
Take also your brother, and arise, go again unto the man.
And God Almighty give you mercy before the man, that he may let your other brother go, and Benjamin. If I be bereaved [of my sons], I am bereaved.
Then the men took the present, and they took double money in their hand, and Benjamin, and rose up and went down to Egypt and stood before Joseph.
And when Joseph saw Benjamin with them, he said to the ruler of his house, Bring [these] men home and slay an animal and make ready; for [these] men shall dine with me at noon.
And the man did as Joseph bade, and the man brought the men into Joseph's house.
And the men were afraid because they were brought into Joseph's house, and they said, Because of the money that was returned in our sacks the first time we are brought in here that he may seek occasion against us and fall upon us and take us for bondmen and our asses.
And they came near to the steward of Joseph's house, and they spoke with him at the door of the house
and said, my lord, we came indeed down the first time to buy food;
and it came to pass when we came to the inn, that we opened our sacks, and, behold, each man's money [was] in the mouth of his sack, our money in full weight; and we have brought it again in our hand.
And we brought down other money in our hands to buy food; we cannot tell who put our money in our sacks.
And he said, Peace [be] to you, fear not; your God, and the God of your father, has given you treasure in your sacks; I had your money. And he brought Simeon out unto them.
And the man brought the men into Joseph's house and gave [them] water, and they washed their feet, and he gave their asses fodder.
And they made ready the present [waiting] until Joseph came at noon, for they heard that they should eat bread there.
And when Joseph came home, they brought him the present which [they had] in their hand in the house and bowed themselves to him to the earth.
And he asked them of [their] welfare and said, [Is] your father well, the old man of whom ye spoke? [Is] he yet alive?
And they answered, Thy servant our father [is] in good health, he [is] yet alive. And they bowed down their heads and made obeisance.
And he lifted up his eyes and saw his brother Benjamin, his mother's son, and said, [Is] this your younger brother, of whom ye spoke unto me? And he said, God be merciful unto thee, my son.
Then Joseph made haste; for his bowels did yearn upon his brother; and he sought [where] to weep, and he entered into [his] chamber and wept there.
And he washed his face and went out and refrained himself and said, Serve bread.
And they served for him by himself, and for them by themselves, and for the Egyptians, who ate with him, by themselves; because the Egyptians may not eat bread with the Hebrews, for that [is] an abomination unto the Egyptians.
And they sat before him, the firstborn according to his birthright and the youngest according to his youth; and the men marvelled one at another.
And he took [and sent] portions unto them from before him; but Benjamin's portion was five times as much as any of theirs. And they drank, and were drunk with him.:

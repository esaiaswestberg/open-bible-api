Then Joseph came and told Pharaoh and said, My father and my brethren and their sheep and their cows and all that they have are come out of the land of Canaan; and, behold, they [are] in the land of Goshen.
And of the least of his brethren he took five men and presented them unto Pharaoh.
And Pharaoh said unto his brethren, What [is] your occupation? And they said unto Pharaoh, Thy servants [are] pastors of sheep, both we [and] also our fathers.
They said moreover unto Pharaoh, For to sojourn in the land are we come, for thy servants have no pasture for their sheep, for the famine [is] sore in the land of Canaan; now therefore, we pray thee, let thy servants dwell in the land of Goshen.
And Pharaoh spoke unto Joseph, saying, Thy father and thy brethren are come unto thee;
the land of Egypt [is] before thee; in the best of the land make thy father and brethren to dwell; in the land of Goshen let them dwell; and if thou knowest [any] men of valour among them, then make them rulers over my livestock.
And Joseph brought in Jacob his father and set him before Pharaoh; and Jacob blessed Pharaoh.
And Pharaoh said unto Jacob, How old [art] thou?
And Jacob said unto Pharaoh, The days of the years of my pilgrimage [are] one hundred and thirty years; few and evil have the days of the years of my life been and have not attained unto the days of the years of the life of my fathers in the days of their pilgrimage.
And Jacob blessed Pharaoh and went out from before Pharaoh.
Thus Joseph placed his father and his brethren and gave them a possession in the land of Egypt in the best of the land, in the land of Rameses, as Pharaoh had commanded.
And Joseph nourished his father and his brethren, and all his father's household with bread, according to [their] families.
And [there was] no bread in all the land, for the famine [was] very sore, so that the land of Egypt and [all] the land of Canaan fainted by reason of the famine.
And Joseph gathered up all the money that was found in the land of Egypt and in the land of Canaan for the food which they bought from him; and Joseph brought the money into Pharaoh's house.
And when money failed in the land of Egypt and in the land of Canaan, all the Egyptians came unto Joseph and said, Give us bread, for why should we die in thy presence for the money fails?
And Joseph said, Give your livestock, and I will give you for your livestock if the money [has] failed.
And they brought their livestock unto Joseph, and Joseph gave them bread [in exchange] for horses and for the sheep and for the bovine livestock and for the asses, and he fed them with bread for all their livestock that year.
When that year was ended, they came unto him the second year and said unto him, We will not hide [it] from my lord how that the money is gone; my lord also has our herds of cattle; there is not nothing left in the sight of my lord, but our bodies and our lands.
Why shall we die before thine eyes, both we and our land? Buy us and our land for bread, and we and our land will be servants unto Pharaoh, and give [us] seed that we may live, and not die, that the land not be desolate.
Then Joseph bought all the land of Egypt for Pharaoh, for each one of the Egyptians sold his field because the famine prevailed over them; so the land became Pharaoh's.
And as for the people, he removed them to cities from [one] end of the borders of Egypt even to the [other] end thereof.
Only the land of the priests he did not buy, for the priests had a portion [assigned them] of Pharaoh and ate their portion which Pharaoh gave them; therefore they did not sell their lands.
Then Joseph said unto the people, Behold, I have bought you this day and your land for Pharaoh; behold, [here is] seed for you, and ye shall sow the land.
And it shall come to pass in the increase that ye shall give the fifth [part] unto Pharaoh, and four parts shall be your own for seed of the field and for your food and for those of your households and for food for your little ones.
And they said, Thou hast saved our lives; let us find grace in the sight of my lord that we might be Pharaoh's servants.
And Joseph made it a statute over the land of Egypt unto this day, [that] Pharaoh should have the fifth [part]; except the land of the priests only, [which] did not become Pharaoh's.
Thus Israel dwelt in the land of Egypt, in the land of Goshen; and they had possessions therein and grew and multiplied exceedingly.
And Jacob lived in the land of Egypt seventeen years; so the whole age of Jacob was one hundred forty-seven years.
And the time drew nigh that Israel must die; and he called his son Joseph and said unto him, If now I have found grace in thy sight, put, I pray thee, thy hand under my thigh and deal with me in mercy and truth; do not bury me, I pray thee, in Egypt;
but I will lie with my fathers, and thou shalt carry me out of Egypt and bury me in their buryingplace. And he said, I will do as thou hast said.
And he said, Swear unto me. And he swore unto him. Then Israel bowed himself upon the bed's head.:

Let brotherly love continue.
Do not forget to show hospitality; for thereby some, having entertained angels, were kept.
Remember those that are in bonds as bound with them [and] those who suffer adversity as being yourselves also in the body.
Let Marriage [be] honourable in all and the bed undefiled; but the fornicators and adulterers God will judge.
[Let your] conversation [be] without covetousness, [and be] content with such things as ye have; for he has said, I will never leave thee, nor forsake thee.
So that we may boldly say, The Lord [is] my helper, and I will not fear what man shall do unto me.
Remember your pastors, who have spoken unto you the word of God, whose faith follow, considering the end of [their] conversation:
Jesus Christ the same yesterday and today and for the ages.
Be not taken out of the way with diverse and strange doctrines. For [it is] a good thing that the heart be established with grace, not with foods which have not profited those that have been occupied with them.

Listen to your pastors, and do not resist them, for they watch for your souls as those that must give account, that they may do it with joy, and not with grief; for that [is] unprofitable for you.
Pray for us: for we trust we have a good conscience in all things desiring to conduct ourselves well.
And I beseech [you] all the more to do this, that I may be restored unto you sooner.
Now the God of peace, that brought again from the dead our Lord Jesus, that great shepherd of the sheep, through the blood of the eternal testament,
make you perfect in every good work to do his will, working in you that which is wellpleasing in his sight, through Jesus Christ, to whom [be] glory for the ages of the ages. Amen.
And I beseech you, brethren, that ye receive [this] word of exhortation, that I have written unto you briefly.
Know ye that [our] brother Timothy is set at liberty; with whom, if he comes shortly, I will see you.
Salute all thy pastors and all the saints. The [brethren] of Italy salute you.
Grace [be] with you all. Amen.:

God, having spoken many times and in many ways in time past unto the fathers by the prophets,
has in these last times spoken unto us by [his] Son, whom he has appointed heir of all things, by whom also he made the ages;
who being the brightness of his glory and the [express] image of his substance and upholding all things by the word of his power, when he had by himself purged our sins, sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high;
being made so much better than the angels, as he has by inheritance obtained a more excellent name than they.
For unto which of the angels did he say at any time, Thou art my Son, this day I have begotten thee? And again, I will be to him a Father, and he shall be to me a Son?
And again, when he brought in the firstbegotten into the world, he said, And let all the angels of God worship him.
And of the angels he said, Who makes his angels spirits and his ministers a flame of fire.
But unto the Son [he said], Thy throne, O God, [is] for ever and ever: a rod of equity [is] the sceptre of thy kingdom.
Thou hast loved righteousness and hated iniquity; therefore, God, [even] thy God, has anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows.
And Thou, Lord, in the beginning hast laid the foundation of the earth; and the heavens are the works of thine hands:
they shall perish; but thou dost remain; and they all shall wax old as doth a garment;
and as a vesture shalt thou fold them up, and they shall be changed; but thou art the same, and thy years shall never fail.
But to which of the angels did he say at any time, Sit on my right hand until I make thine enemies thy footstool?
Are they not all ministering spirits, sent forth in service for the love of those who are the heirs of saving health?:

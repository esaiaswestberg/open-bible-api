Therefore, my brethren dearly beloved and longed for, my joy and crown, so stand fast in the Lord, [my] dearly beloved.
I beseech Euodias and beseech Syntyche, that they be of the same mind in the Lord.
And I intreat thee also, true yokefellow, help those women who laboured with me in the gospel, with Clement also and [with] my other fellowlabourers, whose names [are] in the book of life.
Rejoice in the Lord always, [and] again I say, Rejoice.
Let your moderation be known unto all men. The Lord [is] near.
Be anxious for nothing, but in every thing by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving, let your requests be made known unto God.
And the peace of God, which passes all understanding, shall keep your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus.
Finally, brethren, whatever things are true, whatever things [are] honest, whatever things [are] just, whatever things [are] pure, whatever things [are] lovely, whatever things [are] of good report, if [there is] any virtue and if [there is] any praise, exercise yourselves in these things.
Those things, which ye have both learned and received and heard and seen in me, do, and the God of peace shall be with you.
But I rejoiced in the Lord greatly, that now at the last your care of me has flourished again, in which ye were also concerned, but ye lacked opportunity.
Not that I speak in respect of want, for I have learned, in whatever state I am, to be content.
I know both how to be humbled, and I know how to have an abundance; in everything and by all things I am instructed, both to be full and to be hungry, both to abound and to suffer need.
I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me.
Notwithstanding ye have done well, that ye did communicate with my tribulation.
Now ye Philippians know also that in the beginning of the gospel when I departed from Macedonia, no church communicated with me as concerning giving and receiving, but ye only.
For even in Thessalonica ye sent once and again unto my necessity.
Not because I desire a gift, but I desire fruit that may abound to your account.
But I have all and abound; I am full, having received of Epaphroditus the things [which were sent] from you, an odour of a sweet smell, a sacrifice acceptable, wellpleasing to God.
But my God shall supply all your need according to his riches in glory by Christ Jesus.
Now unto God and our Father [be] glory for ever and ever. Amen.
Greet every saint in Christ Jesus. The brethren who are with me greet you.
All the saints greet you, chiefly those that are of the Caesar's household.
The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ [be] with you all. Amen.:

Against Moab thus hath the LORD of the hosts, the God of Israel said; Woe unto Nebo! for it is destroyed; it is confounded; Kiriathaim is taken; Misgab is confounded and dismayed.
Moab shall no longer be praised; they have devised evil against Heshbon, saying, Come, and let us cut it off from [being] a nation. Also thou shalt be cut down, O Madmen; the sword shall pursue thee.
A voice of crying [shall be] from Horonaim, spoiling and great destruction.
Moab is destroyed; they have caused the cry of her little ones to be heard.
For in the ascending [road] of Luhith he that weeps shall go up weeping; for in the descending [road] of Horonaim the enemies have heard a cry of destruction.
Flee, save your lives, and be like the heath in the wilderness.
For because thou hast trusted in thy works; in thy treasures, thou shalt also be taken; and Chemosh shall go forth into captivity [with] his priests and his princes together.
And the spoiler shall come upon every city, and no city shall escape; the valley also shall perish, and the plain shall be destroyed as the LORD has spoken.
Give wings unto Moab that he may flee and get away, for his cities shall be desolate, without any to dwell therein.
Cursed [be] he that does the work of the LORD deceitfully, and cursed [be] he that keeps back his sword from blood.
Moab has been at ease from his youth, and he has settled on his lees and has not been emptied from vessel to vessel, neither has he gone into captivity; therefore his taste remained in him, and his scent is not changed.
Therefore, behold, the days come, said the LORD, that I will send unto him captors that shall take him captive and shall empty his vessels and break his wineskins.
And Moab shall be ashamed of Chemosh as the house of Israel was ashamed of Bethel their confidence.
How do ye say, We [are] mighty and strong men for the war?
Moab is spoiled, and his cities destroyed, and his chosen young men are gone down to the slaughter, said the King whose name [is] the LORD of the hosts.
The calamity of Moab [is] near to come, and his affliction hastens fast.
All ye that are about him, bemoan him; and all ye that know his name, say, How is the strong staff broken: the beautiful rod!
Thou daughter that dost inhabit Dibon, come down from [thy] glory, and sit in thirst; for the spoiler of Moab has come against thee [and] has dissipated thy strong holds.
O inhabitant of Aroer, stand by the way and watch; ask her that flees and her that escapes [and] say, What has happened?
Moab is confounded, for it is broken down; howl and cry; tell it in Arnon that Moab is spoiled,
and judgment is come upon the plain country; upon Holon, and upon Jahazah, and upon Mephaath,
and upon Dibon, and upon Nebo, and upon Bethdiblathaim,
and upon Kiriathaim, and upon Bethgamul, and upon Bethmeon,
and upon Kerioth, and upon Bozrah, and upon all the cities of the land of Moab, those that are far and those that are near.
The horn of Moab is cut off, and his arm is broken, said the LORD.
Make him drunken, for he magnified [himself] against the LORD; Moab shall also wallow in his vomit, and be in derision.
For was not Israel a derision unto thee, as if he were found among thieves? for since thou hast spoken of him, thou hast slipped.
O ye that dwell in Moab, leave the cities and dwell in the rock and be like the dove [that] makes her nest in the sides of the hole's mouth.
We have heard the pride of Moab, (he is exceeding proud) his loftiness and his arrogancy and his pride and the haughtiness of his heart.
I know his wrath, saith the LORD, but it shall have no effect; his lies shall not be to his advantage.
Therefore I will weep over Moab, and I will cry out for all Moab; [my heart] shall mourn for the men of Kirheres.
O vine of Sibmah, I will weep for thee with the weeping of Jazer; thy shoots are gone over the sea; they reach [even] to the sea of Jazer; the spoiler is fallen upon thy summer fruits and upon thy vintage.
And joy and gladness shall be taken from the plentiful field and from the land of Moab; and I shall cause wine to cease from the winepresses; no one shall tread with song; [their song shall be] no song.
The cry, from Heshbon [even] unto Elealeh, [and even] unto Jahaz, they have uttered their voice; from Zoar [even] unto Horonaim, [as] a heifer of three years old; for the waters of Nimrim shall also be destroyed.
Moreover I will cause to cease in Moab, saith the LORD, him that offers upon [an] altar and him that burns incense to his gods.
Therefore my heart shall sound like flutes for Moab, and my heart shall sound like flutes for the men of Kirheres because the riches [that] he has gotten are perished.
For every head [shall be] bald, and every beard shaved: upon all the hands [shall be] cuttings, and upon all the loins sackcloth.
[There shall be] lamentation generally upon all the housetops of Moab and in the streets thereof; for I have broken Moab like a vessel in which there [is] no pleasure, said the LORD.
They shall howl, [saying], How is it broken down! how has Moab turned the back with shame! so shall Moab be a derision and a dismaying to all those about him.
For thus hath the LORD said: Behold, he shall fly as an eagle and shall spread his wings over Moab.
The cities are taken, and the strong holds are taken, and the mighty men's hearts in Moab at that day shall be as the heart of a woman in her pangs.
And Moab shall be destroyed from [being] a people because he has magnified [himself] against the LORD.
Fear and the pit and the snare [shall be] upon thee, O inhabitant of Moab, said the LORD.
He that flees from the fear shall fall into the pit; and he that gets up out of the pit shall be taken in the snare; for I will bring upon him, [even] upon Moab, the year of their visitation, said the LORD.
Those that fled from the force stood under the shadow of Heshbon; because fire came forth out of Heshbon and a flame from the midst of Sihon and burned the corner of Moab and the crown of the head of the rebellious sons.
Woe be unto thee, O Moab! the people of Chemosh have perished; for thy sons are taken prisoners into captivity, and thy daughters [are] captives.
Yet I will turn again the captivity of Moab in the last of the times, said the LORD. Thus far [is] the judgment of Moab.:

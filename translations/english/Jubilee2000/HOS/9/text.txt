Do not rejoice, O Israel, for joy, as the peoples; for thou hast gone a whoring from thy God, thou hast loved the [salary of a harlot] upon every threshing floor.
The threshing floor and the winepress shall not feed them, and the new wine shall fail in her.
They shall not remain in the land of the LORD; but Ephraim shall return to Egypt and to Assyria where they shall eat unclean food.
They shall not pour out wine unto the LORD, neither shall he take pleasure in their sacrifices; as the bread of mourners [shall they be] unto them; all that eat thereof shall be polluted; for their bread shall not enter into the house of the LORD because of their soul.
What will ye do in the solemn day, and [in] the day of the feast of the LORD?
For, behold, they have left because of the destruction; Egypt shall gather them up, Memphis shall bury them: nettles shall possess in inheritance that which is desirable of their silver; thorns [shall grow up] in their dwellings.
The days of visitation are come, the days of recompense are come; Israel shall know [it]; the prophet [is] a fool, the spiritual man [is] a fool, for the multitude of thine iniquity, and [the] great hatred.
The watchman of Ephraim regarding my God, the prophet, [is a] snare of [a] fowler in all his ways, hatred in the house of his God.
They have arrived at the depths, they have corrupted [themselves] as in the days of Gibeah; [therefore] he will remember their iniquity, he will visit their sin.
I found Israel like grapes in the wilderness; I saw your fathers as the early fruit of the fig tree in her beginning; [but] they went in unto Baalpeor and separated themselves unto shame and made themselves as abominable as that which they loved.
[As for] Ephraim, their glory shall fly away like a bird, from the birth even from the womb and from the conception.
Though they bring up their sons, yet I will bereave them, [that there shall] not [be] a man [left]; yea, woe also to them when I depart from them!
Ephraim, as I saw Tyre, [is] planted in a pleasant place; but Ephraim shall bring forth his sons to the murderer.
Give them, O LORD that which thou must give them; give them a miscarrying womb and dry breasts.
All their wickedness [was] in Gilgal, for there I took a dislike to them; for the wickedness of their doings I will drive them out of my house, I will never love them again: all their princes [are] disloyal.
Ephraim was smitten, their root is dried up; they shall bear no more fruit; even though they bring forth, yet I will slay [even] the desirable [fruit] of their womb.
My God will cast them away because they did not hearken unto him; and they shall be wanderers among the Gentiles.:

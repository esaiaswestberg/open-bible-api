[Set] the shofar to thy mouth. [He shall come] as an eagle against the house of the LORD because they have transgressed my covenant and rebelled against my law.
Israel shall cry unto me, My God, we have known thee.
Israel has cast off the good; the enemy shall pursue him.
They have reigned, but not by me; they have made dominion, and I knew [it] not; of their silver and their gold they have made themselves idols that they may be cut off.
Thy calf, O Samaria, has cast [thee] off; my anger has been kindled against them until they could no longer be absolved.
For it is of Israel; and [a] workman made it who is not God: because the calf of Samaria shall be broken in pieces.
For they have sown the wind, and they shall reap the whirlwind; they shall have no harvest; the fruit shall yield no meal: if so be it yields, the strangers shall swallow it up.
Israel shall be swallowed up; soon they shall be among the Gentiles as a vessel in which [there is] no pleasure.
For they are gone up to Assyria, a wild ass [thinking] only of himself; Ephraim has hired lovers.
Even though they hire the Gentiles, now I will gather them, and they shall sorrow a little for the burden of the king and of the princes.
Because Ephraim has multiplied altars for sin, the altars shall be a sin unto him.
I have written to him the great things of my law, [but] they were counted as strange things.
In the sacrifices of my gifts they sacrificed flesh and ate; [but] the LORD does not accept them; now he will remember their iniquity and visit their sins; they shall return to Egypt.
For Israel has forgotten his Maker and has built temples; and Judah has multiplied fenced cities; but I will send a fire upon his cities, and it shall devour the palaces thereof.:

In the third year of Cyrus king of Persia the Word was revealed unto Daniel, whose name [was called] Belteshazzar; and the Word [was] true, but the time appointed [was] long: and he understood the word, and had intelligence in the vision.
In those days I, Daniel, was mourning three weeks of days.
I ate no pleasant bread, neither did flesh nor wine come into my mouth, neither did I anoint myself at all until the three weeks of days were fulfilled.
And in the twenty-fourth day of the first month as I was by the side of the great river, which [is] Hiddekel;
and lifting up my eyes, I saw, and behold a man clothed in linens, whose loins [were] girded with very pure gold:
his body [was] like the [stone of] Tarsis [turquoise], and his face as a [bolt of] lightning, and his eyes as lamps of fire, and his arms and his feet like in colour to brilliant brass, and the voice of his words like the voice of [an] army.
And only I, Daniel, saw that vision: for the men that were with me did not see the vision; but a great fear fell upon them, and they fled and hid themselves.
Therefore I was left alone and saw this great vision, and there remained no strength in me, for my strength was turned into dismay, and I retained no strength.
Yet I heard the voice of his words, and when I heard the voice of his words, then was I placed into a deep sleep on my face, and my face [was] toward the ground.
And, behold, a hand touched me and caused me to move upon my knees and [upon] the palms of my hands.
And he said unto me, Daniel, O man greatly beloved, pay attention to the words that I shall speak unto thee, and stand up upon thy feet: for I am sent now unto thee. And as he was speaking this with me, I was trembling.
And he said unto me, Fear not, Daniel: for from the first day that thou didst give thy heart to understand and to afflict thy soul before thy God, thy words were heard, and I am come because of thy words.
But the prince of the kingdom of Persia withstood me twenty-one days: and behold, Michael, one of the chief princes, came to help me; and I remained there with the kings of Persia.
Now I am come to make thee know what shall befall thy people in the latter days, for there shall still [be] vision for [several] days.
And as he was speaking such words unto me, I looked toward the ground and became dumb.
And, behold, [one] like the similitude of [the] son of man touched my lips; then I opened my mouth and spoke and said unto him that stood before me, O my Lord, by the vision my sorrows are turned upon me, and I have retained no strength.
For how can the servant of my Lord talk with my Lord? for as for me, for in that instant I had no more strength in me, neither was there any breath left in me.
Then there came again and touched me [one] like the appearance of a man, and he comforted me,
and said, O man greatly beloved, fear not: peace [be] unto thee, be of good cheer, and be well. And as he spoke unto me, I was strengthened and said, Let my Lord speak; for thou hast strengthened me.
Then said he, Knowest thou why I have come unto thee? Because now I must return to fight with the prince of the Persians; and when I am gone forth, next the prince of Grecia shall come.
But I will interpret unto thee that which is written in the scripture of truth: and [there is] no one that holds with me in these [things], but Michael your prince.:

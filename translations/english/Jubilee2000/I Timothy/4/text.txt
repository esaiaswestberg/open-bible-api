Now the Spirit speaks expressly, that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith, listening to spirits of error and doctrines of demons;
that in hypocrisy shall speak lies; having their conscience seared as with a hot iron;
they shall forbid to marry and shall command [men] to abstain from foods, which God has created to be received with thanksgiving by those who are faithful and have known the truth.
For everything that God created [is] good, and nothing [is] to be refused, if it is received with thanksgiving,
for it is sanctified by the word of God and prayer.
If thou put these things before the brethren, thou shalt be a good minister of Jesus Christ, nourished up in the words of faith and of good doctrine, unto which thou hast attained.
But refuse profane and old wives' fables, and exercise thyself [rather] unto godliness.
For bodily exercise profits [a] little, but godliness is profitable unto all things, having promise of the life that now is and of that which is to come.
The Word [is] faithful and worthy of acceptation by all.
For this we both labour and suffer reproach, because we trust in the living God, who is the Saviour of all men, specially of those that believe.
Command and teach this.
Let no man despise thy youth, but be thou an example of the faithful in word, in conversation, in charity, in spirit, in faith, in purity.
Until I come, occupy thyself reading, exhorting, teaching.
Neglect not the gift that is in thee, which is given unto thee to prophesy, through the laying on of the hands of the elders.
Occupy thyself in these things [with care], for in this is [everything], that thy profiting may be manifest unto all.
Take heed unto thyself and unto the doctrine; be diligent in this, for in doing so thou shalt both save thyself and those that hear thee.:

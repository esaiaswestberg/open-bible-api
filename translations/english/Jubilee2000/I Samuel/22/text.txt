And David departed from there and escaped to the cave Adullam; and when his brethren and all his father's house heard [it], they went down there to him.
And every one [that was] in distress and every one that [was] in debt and all whose souls were bitter gathered themselves unto him, and he became the captain over them, and there were about four hundred men with him.
And David went from there to Mizpeh of Moab, and he said unto the king of Moab, Let my father and my mother, I pray thee, come forth [and be] with you until I know what God will make of me.
And he brought them before the king of Moab, and they dwelt with him all the while that David was in the fortress.
And the prophet Gad said unto David, do not abide in this fortress; depart, and go into the land of Judah. Then David departed and came into the forest of Hareth.
When Saul heard how David had appeared and the men that [were] with him (now Saul abode in Gibeah under a tree in Ramah, having his spear in his hand, and all his servants [were] standing about him),
then Saul said unto his servants that stood about him, Hear now, ye sons of Jemini, will the son of Jesse give every one of you fields and vineyards [and] make you all captains of thousands and captains of hundreds
that all of you have conspired against me, and [there is] no one that shows me that my son has made a league with the son of Jesse, and [there is] none of you that is sorry for me or shows unto me that my son has stirred up my servant against me, to lie in wait [against] me, as at this day?
Then Doeg, the Edomite, who was set over the servants of Saul, answered and said, I saw the son of Jesse coming to Nob to Ahimelech, the son of Ahitub.
And he enquired of the LORD for him and gave him provision and gave him the sword of Goliath, the Philistine.
Then the king sent to call Ahimelech, the priest, the son of Ahitub, and all his father's house, the priests that [were] in Nob; and they all came to the king.
And Saul said, Hear now, thou son of Ahitub. And he answered, Here I [am], my lord.
And Saul said unto him, Why have ye conspired against me, thou and the son of Jesse, in that thou hast given him bread and a sword and hast enquired of God for him that he should rise against me, to lie in wait, as at this day?
Then Ahimelech answered the king and said, And who is so faithful among all thy servants as David, the king's son-in-law, who goes at thy bidding and is honourable in thy house?
Did I begin to enquire of God for him today? Be it far from me; let not the king impute [any] thing unto his servant [nor] to all the house of my father, for thy servant knew nothing of all this, less or more.
And the king said, Thou shalt surely die, Ahimelech, thou and all thy father's house.
Then the king said unto the footmen that stood about him, Turn and slay the priests of the LORD because their hand also [is] with David and because they knew when he fled and did not show it to me. But the servants of the king would not put forth their hands to fall upon the priests of the LORD.
Then the king said to Doeg, Turn thou and fall upon the priests. And Doeg, the Edomite, turned and he fell upon the priests and slew on that day eighty-five men that wore a linen ephod.
And Nob, the city of the priests, he smote with the edge of the sword, both men and women, children and sucklings and oxen and asses and sheep with the edge of the sword.
And one of the sons of Ahimelech, the son of Ahitub, named Abiathar, escaped and fled after David.
And Abiathar gave David the news that Saul had slain the LORD'S priests.
And David said unto Abiathar, I knew [it] that day when Doeg, the Edomite, [was] there that he would surely tell Saul. I have given cause [before Saul] against all the persons of thy father's house.
Abide thou with me; do not fear, for he that seeks my life seeks thy life; [it is good] that thou shalt be kept with me.:

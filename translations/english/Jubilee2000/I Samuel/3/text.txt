And the child Samuel ministered unto the LORD before Eli. And the word of the LORD was precious in those days; [there was] no open vision.
And it came to pass one day when Eli [was] lain down in his place, his eyes began to wax dim, that he could not see;
and before the lamp of God was put out, Samuel was sleeping in the temple of the LORD, where the ark of God [was];
and the LORD called Samuel, and he answered, Here [am] I.
And he ran unto Eli and said, Here [am] I, for thou didst call me. And he said, I did not call; lie down again. And he went and lay down.
And the LORD called Samuel yet again. And Samuel arose and went to Eli and said, Here [am] I, for thou didst call me. And he answered, I did not call, my son; lie down again.
Now Samuel did not yet know the LORD, neither had the word of the LORD yet been revealed unto him.
And the LORD called Samuel again the third time. And he arose and went to Eli and said, Here [am] I, for thou didst call me. Then Eli perceived that the LORD was calling the child.
Therefore, Eli said unto Samuel, Go, lie down, and it shall be if he calls thee, that thou shalt say, Speak, LORD, for thy servant hears. So Samuel went and lay down in his place.
And the LORD came and stood and called as at the other times, Samuel, Samuel. Then Samuel answered, Speak; for thy servant hears.
And the LORD said unto Samuel, Behold, I will do a thing in Israel, at which both the ears of each one that hears it shall tingle.
In that day I will perform against Eli all the things which I have spoken concerning his house; when I begin, I will also make an end.
For I have told him that I will judge his house for ever for the iniquity which he knows of (because his sons made themselves vile, and he did not restrain them).
And therefore, I have sworn unto the house of Eli that the iniquity of Eli's house shall not be reconciled, [not] with sacrifices nor with presents for ever.
And Samuel lay until the morning and opened the doors of the house of the LORD. And Samuel feared to show Eli the vision.
Then Eli called Samuel and said, Samuel, my son. And he answered, Here [am] I.
And he said, What [is] the word that [the LORD] has spoken unto thee? I pray thee do not hide [it] from me. God do so to thee and more also, if thou hide [any] thing from me of all the word that he spoke unto thee.
And Samuel declared all of it to him without hiding any thing. Then he said, It [is] the LORD; let him do what seems good unto him.
And Samuel grew, and the LORD was with him and did not let any of his words fall to the ground.
And all Israel from Dan even to Beersheba knew that Samuel [was] a faithful prophet of the LORD.
Thus the LORD appeared again in Shiloh, for the LORD manifested himself to Samuel in Shiloh with [the] word of the LORD.:

Let us reckon men as ministers of Christ and stewards of the mysteries of God.
Moreover, it is required in stewards that each one be found faithful.
But with me it is a very small thing that I should be judged by you or by man's judgment; I do not even judge my own self.
For although I have nothing on my conscience, yet am I not hereby justified, but he that judges me is the Lord.
Therefore, judge nothing before the time, until the Lord comes, who both will bring to light the hidden things of darkness and will make manifest the counsels of the hearts; and then shall each one have praise of God.
And these things, brethren, I have in a figure transferred to myself and [to] Apollos for your sakes, that in us ye might not learn above that which is written, lest because of one, some of you become puffed up against others.
For who makes thee to judge? and what hast thou that thou didst not receive? now if thou didst receive [it], what dost thou glory of, as if thou hadst not received [it]?
Now ye are full, now ye are rich, ye reign as kings without us, and I wish ye did reign, that we also might reign with you.
For I think that God has set forth us the apostles last, as it were appointed to death; for we are made a spectacle unto the world and to angels and to men.
We [are] fools for Christ's sake, but ye [are] prudent in Christ; we [are] weak, but ye [are] strong; ye [are] honourable, but we [are] despised.
Even unto this present hour we both hunger and thirst and are ill clad and are buffeted and have no certain dwellingplace
and labour, working with our own hands; being reviled, we bless; being persecuted, we suffer it;
being blasphemed, we intreat; we are made as the filth of this world [and are] the offscouring of all things unto this day.
I do not write these things to shame you, but [to] warn you, as to my beloved sons.
For though ye may have ten thousand instructors in Christ, yet ye [shall] not [have] many fathers, for in Christ Jesus I have begotten you through the gospel.
Therefore, I beseech you that ye imitate me.
For this cause I have sent Timothy unto you, who is my beloved son and faithful in the Lord, who shall bring you into remembrance of my ways which are in Christ, as I teach everywhere in every church.
Now some are puffed up as though I will never come to you.
But I will come to you shortly, if the Lord wills, and will know not the words of those who are puffed up, but the virtue.
For the kingdom of God [is] not in words, but in virtue.
What will ye? Shall I come unto you with a rod or in charity and [in] the spirit of meekness?:

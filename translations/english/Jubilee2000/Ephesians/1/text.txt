Paul, apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, to the saints who are at Ephesus and to the faithful in Christ Jesus:
Grace [be] to you and peace from God our Father and [from] the Lord Jesus Christ.
Blessed [be] the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly [things] in Christ;
according as he has chosen us in him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and without blemish before him in charity;
having marked out beforehand [the way] for us to be adopted as sons by Jesus Christ in himself, according to the good pleasure of his will,
to the praise of the glory of his grace, in which he has made us accepted in the beloved;
in whom we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins according to the riches of his grace,
which has over abounded in us in all wisdom and prudence;
having made known unto us the mystery of his will, according to his good pleasure which he has purposed in himself,
that in the dispensation of the fulfillment of the times he might restore all things by the Christ, both those which are in heaven and those which are on earth,
in him in whom likewise we have obtained an inheritance, having had [the way] marked out beforehand according to the purpose of him who works all things after the counsel of his own will,
so that we should be to the praise of his glory, those of us who first trusted in the Christ.
In whom ye also [trusted], hearing the word of truth, the gospel of your saving health; in whom also after ye believed, ye were sealed with that Holy Spirit of the promise,
which is the earnest of our inheritance unto the redemption of the purchased possession, unto the praise of his glory.
Therefore I also, after I heard of your faith in the Lord Jesus and charity unto all the saints,
cease not to give thanks for you, making mention of you in my prayers;
that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give unto you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him;
illuminating the eyes of your understanding, that ye may know what is the hope of his calling and what [are] the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints
and what [is] the exceeding greatness of his power in us who believe, by the operation of the power of his strength,
which operated in the Christ, raising him from the dead and setting [him] at his own right hand in the heavenly [places],
far above all principality and power and might and dominion and every name that is named, not only in this age, but also in that which is to come,
And has put all [things] under his feet and gave him [to be] the head over all [things] to the church,
which is his body, and he is the fullness of her: who fills all things in everyone.:

Woe to her that is filthy and polluted, to the oppressing city!
She did not obey the voice; she did not receive correction; she did not trust in the LORD; she did not draw near to her God.
Her princes within her [are] roaring lions; her judges [are] evening wolves; they do not leave a bone for tomorrow.
Her prophets [are] light [and] treacherous persons: her priests have polluted the sanctuary; they have falsified the law.
The just LORD [is] in the midst thereof; he will not do iniquity: each morning he shall bring his judgment to light; he never fails; but the unjust know no shame.
I have caused [the] Gentiles to be cut off: their castles are desolate; I made their streets waste until no one passes by; their cities are destroyed, so that there is no man [left], there is no inhabitant.
Saying, Surely [now] thou wilt fear me; thou wilt receive chastisement; so thy dwelling shall not be thrown down, all of which I visited upon her; but they rose early, [and] corrupted all their doings.
Therefore wait for me, said the LORD, until the day that I rise up to the prey; for my judgment [is] to gather [the] Gentiles, that I may assemble the kingdoms to pour upon them my indignation, [even] all my fierce anger; for all the earth shall be devoured with the fire of my jealousy.
For then I will restore to the peoples the pure language that they may all call upon the name of the LORD to serve him with one consent.
From beyond the rivers of Ethiopia my suppliants, [even] the daughter of my dispersed, shall bring me an offering.
In that day thou shalt not be ashamed for any of thy doings, in which thou hast rebelled against me, for then I will take away out of the midst of thee those that rejoice in thy pride, and thou shalt no longer be haughty because of the mountain of my holiness.
I will also leave in the midst of thee a poor and humble people, and they shall wait in the name of the LORD.
The remnant of Israel shall not do iniquity nor speak lies; neither shall a deceitful tongue be found in their mouth, for they shall be fed and lie down, and no one shall make [them] afraid.
Sing, O daughter of Zion; [shout with] joy O Israel; be glad and rejoice with all thy heart, O daughter of Jerusalem.
The LORD has taken away thy judgments; he has cast out thine enemy; the LORD is king of Israel in the midst of thee; thou shalt not see evil any more.
In that time it shall be said to Jerusalem, Do not fear; [and to] Zion, Do not let thine hands be slack.
The LORD thy God in the midst of thee is mighty; he will save; he will rejoice over thee with joy; he will rest in his love; he will joy over thee with singing.
I will gather [those that are] weary because of the [long] time, [who] are thine, [unto whom] her confusion [was] a burden.
Behold, at that time I will undo all that afflict thee; and I will save her that is lame and gather her that was driven out; and I will make them a praise and of [good] reputation in every land where they have been put to shame.
At that time will I bring you [again], even in the time that I gather you; for I will give you as fame and as praise among all peoples of the earth, when I shall return your captives before your eyes, saith the LORD.:

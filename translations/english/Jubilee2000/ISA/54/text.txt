Rejoice, O barren, thou [that] didst not bear; break forth into singing, and cry aloud with joy, thou [that] didst not travail with child: for more [shall be] the sons of the desolate than the sons of the married wife, said the LORD.
Enlarge the place of thy tent, and let them stretch forth the curtains of thine habitations: spare not, lengthen thy cords, and strengthen thy stakes;
for thou shalt break forth on the right hand and on the left, and thy seed shall inherit the Gentiles and make the desolate cities to be inhabited.
Fear not; for thou shalt not be ashamed: neither be thou confounded; for thou shalt not be put to shame: for thou shalt forget the shame of thy youth, and shalt not remember the reproach of thy widowhood any more.
For thy Maker [shall be] thine husband; the LORD of the hosts [is] his name; and thy Redeemer the Holy One of Israel; The God of the whole earth shall he be called.

And all thy sons [shall be] taught of the LORD; and the peace of thy sons shall be multiplied.
With righteousness shalt thou be adorned: thou shalt be far from oppression; for thou shalt not fear [it]; and from terror; for it shall not come near thee.
If anyone should conspire against thee, it [shall be] without me, [but] not by me: whosoever would conspire against thee shall fall before thee.
Behold, I have created the smith that blows the coals in the fire, and that brings forth the instrument for his work; and I have created the waster to destroy.

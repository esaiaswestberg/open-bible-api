Thus saith the LORD to his Messiah, to Cyrus, whom I have taken by his right hand to subdue Gentiles before him and to loose the loins of kings. To open before him the [two-leaved] gates; and the gates shall not be shut:
I will go before thee and make the crooked places straight; I will break in pieces the gates of bronze and cut in sunder the bars of iron:
And I will give thee the hidden treasures and the well guarded secrets that thou may know that I [am] the LORD, the God of Israel, who gives [thee] thy name.
For Jacob my servant's sake and Israel my elect, I have even called thee by thy name: I have surnamed thee, though thou hast not known me.
I am the LORD, and [there is] no one else; [there is] no God beside me; I shall gird thee, though thou hast not known me
that it may be known from the rising of the sun and from where it goes down that [there is] no one beside me. I [am] the LORD, and [there is] no one else.
I form the light and create darkness; I make peace and create evil: I [am] the LORD that does all this.
Release, ye heavens, from above, and the clouds shall pour down righteousness; let the earth open [up], and let salvation and righteousness bear their fruit; let them produce [fruit] together; I the LORD have created it.
Woe unto him that strives with his Maker! [Let] the potsherd [strive] with the potsherds of the earth. Shall the clay say to him that fashions it, What doth thou make; thy work [has] no form?
Woe unto him that says unto [his] father, Why dost thou beget? or to the woman, Why hast thou brought forth?
Thus saith the LORD, the Holy One of Israel, and his Maker, Ask me of things to come; inquire of me concerning my sons and concerning the work of my hands.
I have made the earth, and created man upon it, I, [even] my hands, have stretched out the heavens and I have commanded all their host.
I have awakened him in righteousness, and I will make straight all his ways; he shall build my city, and he shall loose my captives, not for price nor for bribes, saith the LORD of the hosts.
Thus saith the LORD, The labour of Egypt, and merchandise of Ethiopia and of the Sabeans, men of stature, shall come over unto thee, and they shall be thine: they shall come after thee; in chains they shall come over, and they shall fall down unto thee; they shall make supplication unto thee, [saying], Surely God [is] in thee; and [there is] no one else; [there is] none [other] beside God.
Verily thou [art] God, that thou [might] hide thyself; God of Israel, who saves.
They shall be ashamed and also confounded, all of them; all the makers of idols shall go forth ashamed.
Israel is saved in the LORD, eternal salvation; ye shall never be ashamed nor confounded through all ages.
For thus has the LORD said that creates the heavens; God himself that forms the earth, he who made it and established it. He did not create it in vain; he created it to be inhabited; I [am] the LORD; and [there] is no one else.
I have not spoken in secret in [a] dark place of the earth. Not without substance did I say unto the seed of Jacob, Seek ye me; I [am] the LORD who speaks righteousness, who declares things that are right.
Assemble yourselves and come; draw near together, all ye [that are] escaped of the Gentiles. They have no knowledge that set up the wood of their graven image and pray unto the god [that] does not save.
Tell ye, and bring [them] near; [yea], let them take counsel together; who caused this to be heard from the beginning and has declared it from that time, except me, the LORD? and [there is] no God beside me; a just God and a Saviour; [there is] no one besides me.
Look unto me, and be ye saved, all the ends of the earth; for I [am] God, and [there is] no one else.
I have sworn by myself; the word is gone out of my mouth [in] righteousness and shall not return, That unto me every knee shall bow; every tongue shall swear.
And unto me he shall say, Surely in the LORD [is] the righteousness and the strength; until he shall come; and all that are incensed against him shall be ashamed.
In the LORD shall all the generation of Israel be justified and shall glory.:

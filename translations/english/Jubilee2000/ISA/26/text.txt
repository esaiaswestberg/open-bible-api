In that day they shall sing this song in the land of Judah; We have a strong city; [God] has appointed saving health [for] walls and bulwarks.
Open ye the gates, that the righteous nation which keeps the truth may enter in.
Thou wilt keep [him] in perfect peace, [whose] mind [is] stayed [on thee]: because he trusts in thee.
Trust ye in the LORD for ever: for in JAH, the LORD [is] the strength of the ages:
For he has brought down those that dwelt on high; he has humbled the lofty city; he humbled her, [even] to the ground; he brought her down [even] to the dust.
The foot shall tread her down, [even the] feet of the poor, [and the] steps of the needy.
The way of the just [is] uprightness: thou, most upright, dost weigh the path of the just.
Yea, in the way of thy judgments, O LORD, we wait for thee; the desire of [our] soul [is] to thy name and to the remembrance of thee.
With my soul I desire thee in the night; [yea], even as long as the spirit is within me I will seek thee early: for as long as thy judgments [are] in the earth, the inhabitants of the world learn righteousness.
Let favour be showed to the wicked, [yet] will he not learn righteousness: in the land of uprightness he will deal unjustly and will not behold the majesty of the LORD.
LORD, [when] thy hand is withdrawn, they will not see: [but] they shall see in the end and be ashamed with the zeal of the people. And fire shall consume thine enemies.
LORD, thou wilt ordain peace for us: for thou also hast wrought in us all our works.
O LORD our God, [other] lords have had dominion over us without thee: [but] in thee only will we remember thy name.
[They are] dead, they shall not live; [they are] deceased, they shall not rise because thou hast visited and destroyed them and made all their memory to perish.
Thou hast added the Gentiles, O LORD, thou hast added the Gentiles: thou hast made thyself glorious: thou hast extended thyself [unto] all the ends of the earth.
LORD, in the tribulation they have sought thee, they poured out prayer [when] thy chastening [was] upon them.
Like as a woman with child, [that] draws near the time of her delivery, is in pain, [and] cries out in her pangs; so have we been in thy sight, O LORD.
We have conceived, we have had birth pangs; we have, as it were, brought forth wind; we have not wrought any health in the earth; neither have the inhabitants of the world fallen.
Thy dead shall live, and [together with] my body they shall arise. Awake and sing, ye that dwell in dust: for thy dew [is as] the covering of light, and the earth shall cast out the dead.
Come, my people, enter thou into thy chambers, and shut thy doors about thee: hide thyself, as it were, for a little moment until the indignation is overpast.
For, behold, the LORD comes out of his place to visit the iniquity of the inhabitant of the earth against himself: the earth also shall disclose her blood and shall no longer cover her slain.:

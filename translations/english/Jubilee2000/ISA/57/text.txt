The righteous perishes, and no man lays [it] to heart: and merciful men [are] taken away, none considering that the righteous is taken away from the evil [to come].
He shall enter into peace: they shall rest in their beds, [each one] walking [in] his uprightness.
But come here, ye sons of the sorceress, generation of the adulterer and the whore.
Against whom do ye sport yourselves? Against whom do ye make a wide mouth, [and] draw out the tongue? [Are] ye not rebellious sons, a lying seed of transgression,
inflaming yourselves with idols under every green tree, slaying the children in the valleys under the clefts of the rocks?
Among the smooth [stones] of the valley [is] thy portion; they, they [are] thy lot: even unto them hast thou poured a drink offering, thou hast offered a present. Should I not avenge these things?
Upon the lofty and high mountain thou hast set thy bed: even there thou didst go up to offer sacrifice.
Behind the doors also and the posts thou hast set up thy remembrance: for thou hast discovered [thyself to another] than me, and art gone up; thou hast enlarged thy bed and made thee [a covenant] with them; thou didst loved their bed wherever thou didst see [it].
And thou didst go to the king with ointment and didst multiply thy perfumes, and didst send thy messengers far off, and didst debase [thyself even] unto Sheol.
Thou became wearied in the multitude of thy ways; [yet] thou didst not say, There is no remedy: thou hast found that which thou wast searching for; therefore thou repented not.
And of whom hast thou reverenced or feared? Why dost thou lie; that thou hast not remembered me, nor have I come to thy thought? Have I not held my peace even of old, and thou hast never feared me?
I will declare thy righteousness, and thy works; for they shall not profit thee.
When thou criest, let thy companions deliver thee; but the wind shall carry them all away; vanity shall take [them]: but he that waits in me shall have the land by inheritance and shall possess the mountain of my holiness.
And shall say, Clear away, clear away, level the way, take away the stumblingblocks out of the way of my people.
For thus has said the high and lofty One that inhabits eternity, whose name [is] The Holy [One]; I dwell in the high place and in holiness and with him also [that is] of a contrite and humble spirit to cause the spirit of the humble to live and to cause the heart of the contrite ones to live.
For I will not contend for ever, neither will I be always wroth: for by me is the spirit covered by the body, and I have made the souls.
For the iniquity of his covetousness I was wroth and smote him: I hid [my face] and was wroth, and he went on rebelliously in the way of his heart.
I have seen his ways and will heal him: I will lead him also and restore comforts unto him and to his mourners.
I create the fruit of the lips; Peace, peace to [him that is] far off and to [him that is] near, said the LORD; and healed him.
But the wicked [are] like the sea in tempest, that cannot rest, whose waters cast up mire and dirt.
[There is] no peace, saith my God, for the wicked.:

For Zion's sake I will not hold my peace; and for Jerusalem's sake I will not rest until her righteousness goes forth as brightness and her saving health is lit as a flaming torch.
And the Gentiles shall see thy righteousness and all the kings thy glory; and thou shalt be given [a] new name, which the mouth of the LORD shall name.
Thou shalt also be a crown of glory in the hand of the LORD and a royal diadem in the hand of thy God.
Thou shalt no longer be termed Forsaken; neither shall thy land any longer be termed Desolate; but thou shalt be called Hephzibah and thy land Beulah; for the will of the LORD [shall be] in thee, and thy land shall be married.
For [as] a young man marries a virgin, [so] shall thy sons marry thee; and [as] the bridegroom rejoices with the bride, [so] shall thy God rejoice with thee.
I have set watchmen upon thy walls, O Jerusalem, [which] shall never hold their peace day nor night; ye that make mention of the LORD, do not keep silent
and give him no rest, until he establishes and until he makes Jerusalem a praise in the earth.
The LORD has sworn by his right hand, and by the arm of his strength, Surely I will no longer give thy wheat [to be] food for thine enemies; and the sons of the stranger shall not drink thy wine, for which thou hast laboured:
But those that have gathered it shall eat it and praise the LORD; and those that have brought it together shall drink it in the courts of my holiness.
Go through, go through the gates; prepare ye the way of the people; clear up, clear up the highway; gather out the stones; lift up a banner [as an example] for the people.
Behold, the LORD has caused it to be heard unto the end of the earth; Say unto the daughter of Zion, Behold, thy Saviour comes; behold that his reward [is] with him, and his work before him.
And they shall call them, The holy people, The redeemed of the LORD; and thou shalt be called, Sought out, A city not forsaken.:

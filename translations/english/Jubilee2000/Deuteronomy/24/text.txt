When a man has taken a wife and married her, and it comes to pass that she finds no favour in his eyes because he has found some indecency in her; then let him write her a bill of divorce and give [it] in her hand and send her out of his house.
And when she is departed out of his house, she may go and be another man's [wife].
And [if] the latter husband hates her and writes her a bill of divorce and gives [it] in her hand and sends her out of his house, or if the latter husband who took her [to be] his wife dies,
her former husband, who sent her away, may not take her again to be his wife, after she is defiled, for that [is] abomination before the LORD; and thou shalt not cause the land to sin, which the LORD thy God gives thee [for] an inheritance.
When a man has taken a new wife, he shall not go out to war, neither shall he be charged with any business; [but] he shall be free at home one year and shall cheer up his wife whom he has taken.
No man shall take the lower or the upper millstone for a pledge, for he takes [a man's] life to pledge.
When a man is found stealing any of his brethren of the sons of Israel and making merchandise of him or selling him, then that thief shall die; and thou shalt put the evil away from among you.
Keep yourselves from the plague of leprosy that thou observe diligently and do according to all that the priests the Levites shall teach you; as I commanded them, so ye shall take care to do.
Remember what the LORD thy God did unto Miriam by the way after ye were come forth out of Egypt.
When thou dost lend thy brother any thing, thou shalt not go into his house to take his pledge.
Thou shalt stand outside, and the man to whom thou dost lend shall bring the pledge out unto thee.
And if the man [is] poor, thou shalt not sleep with his pledge.
Without fail thou shalt deliver him the pledge again when the sun goes down that he may sleep in his own clothing and bless thee, and it shall be righteousness unto thee before the LORD thy God.
Thou shalt not do violence unto a hired servant [that] is poor and needy, [whether he is] of thy brethren or of thy strangers that [are] in thy land within thy gates.
In his day thou shalt give [him] his hire, neither shall the sun go down upon it; for he [is] poor and with it sustains his life, lest he cry against thee unto the LORD, and it be sin unto thee.
The fathers shall not be put to death for the children, neither shall the children be put to death for the fathers; each one shall be put to death for his own sin.
Thou shalt not twist the rights of the stranger [nor] of the fatherless nor take a widow's clothing for a pledge,
but thou shalt remember that thou wast a slave in Egypt, and the LORD thy God ransomed thee from there; therefore, I command thee to do this thing.
When thou doest reap thy harvest in thy field and hast forgot a sheaf in the field, thou shalt not go again to bring it; it shall be for the stranger, for the fatherless, or for the widow, that the LORD thy God may bless thee in all the work of thine hands.
When thou beatest thine olive tree, thou shalt not go over the boughs again; it shall be for the stranger, for the fatherless, and for the widow.
When thou gatherest the grapes of thy vineyard, thou shalt not glean [it] afterward; it shall be for the stranger, for the fatherless, and for the widow.
And thou shalt remember that thou wast a slave in the land of Egypt; therefore, I command thee to do this thing.:

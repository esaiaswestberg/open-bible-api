And it shall come to pass if thou shalt hearken diligently unto the voice of the LORD thy God to keep [and] to do all his commandments which I command thee this day, that the LORD thy God will set thee on high above all the Gentiles of the earth;
and all these blessings shall come upon thee and overtake thee when thou shalt hearken unto the voice of the LORD thy God.
Blessed [shalt] thou [be] in the city and blessed [shalt] thou [be] in the field.
Blessed [shall] be the fruit of thy body and the fruit of thy ground and the fruit of thy beasts, the increase of thy cows, and the flocks of thy sheep.
Blessed [shall be] thy basket and thy store.
Blessed [shalt] thou [be] when thou comest in, and blessed [shalt] thou [be] when thou goest out.
The LORD shall cause thine enemies that rise up against thee to be smitten before thy face; they shall come out against thee one way and flee before thee seven ways.
The LORD shall command the blessing upon thee in thy storehouses and in all that thou settest thine hand unto; and he shall bless thee in the land which the LORD thy God gives thee.

And it shall come to pass if thou wilt not hearken unto the voice of the LORD thy God, to keep, to do all his commandments and his statutes which I command thee today, that all these curses shall come upon thee and overtake thee.
Cursed [shalt] thou [be] in the city, and cursed [shalt] thou [be] in the field.
Cursed [shall] be thy basket and thy store.
Cursed [shall] be the fruit of thy body and the fruit of thy land, the increase of thy cows and the flocks of thy sheep.
Cursed [shalt] thou [be] when thou comest in, and cursed [shalt] thou [be] when thou goest out.

The LORD shall smite thee with madness and blindness and astonishment of heart.
And thou shalt grope at noonday as the blind grope in the darkness, and thou shalt not be prospered in thy ways; and thou shalt only be oppressed and spoiled all the days, and [there shall be] no one to save [thee].
Thou shalt betroth a wife, and another man shall lie with her; thou shalt build a house, and thou shalt not dwell therein; thou shalt plant a vineyard and shalt not gather the grapes thereof.

and they shall be in thee for a sign and for a wonder, and in thy seed for ever.
Because thou didst not serve the LORD thy God with joyfulness and with gladness of heart, for the abundance of all [things];

The LORD shall bring a nation against thee from afar, from the end of the earth, [as swift] as the eagle flies, a nation whose tongue thou shalt not understand,
a nation of fierce countenance, which shall not regard the person of the old nor show favour to the young;

so that he will not give to any of them of the flesh of his children whom he shall eat, because he shall have nothing left him in the siege and in the straitness with which thine enemies shall distress thee in all thy gates.
The tender and delicate woman among you who would not venture to set the sole of her foot upon the ground for delicateness and tenderness, her eye shall be evil toward the husband of her bosom and toward her son and toward her daughter
and toward her young one that comes out from between her feet and toward her children which she shall bear, for she shall eat them for want of all [things] secretly in the siege and straitness with which thine enemy shall distress thee in thy gates,
if thou wilt not observe to do all the words of this law that are written in this book that thou may fear this glorious and fearful name; I AM thy God.
Then the LORD will augment thy plagues wonderfully, and the plagues of thy seed, [even] great plagues and of long continuance, and evil sicknesses and of long continuance.

and thy life shall hang in doubt before thee; and thou shalt fear day and night and shalt have no assurance of thy life.
In the morning thou shalt say, I wish it were evening, and in the evening thou shalt say, I wish it were morning! For the fear of thine heart with which thou shalt fear and for the that which thine eyes shall see.
And the LORD shall bring thee into Egypt again in ships by the way of which I spoke unto thee, Thou shalt see it no more again; and there ye shall be sold unto your enemies for bondmen and bondwomen, and there shall be no one to buy [you].:

And I turned and lifted up my eyes and looked, and, behold, there came four chariots out from between two mountains, and those mountains [were] of brass.
In the first chariot [were] red horses and in the second chariot black horses;
in the third chariot white horses and in the fourth chariot grisled and bay horses.
Then I answered and said unto the angel that talked with me, What [is] this, my lord?
And the angel answered and said unto me, These [are] the four spirits of the heavens, which go forth from standing before the Lord of all the earth.
The one with the black horses went forth towards the north country, and the white went forth after them, and the grisled went forth toward the south country.
And the bay went forth and sought to go that they might walk to and fro through the earth, and he said, Go from here; walk to and fro through the earth. So they walked to and fro through the earth.
Then he called me and spoke unto me, saying, Behold, those that went toward the north country have quieted my spirit in the north country.
And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,
Take of [those of that returned from] the captivity, [of the lineage] of Heldai, of Tobijah, and of Jedaiah, and come thou the same day and go into the house of Josiah the son of Zephaniah, whom are come from Babylon.
Thou shalt take silver and gold and make crowns and set [them] upon the head of Joshua the son of Josedech, the high priest,
and speak unto him, saying, Thus spoke the LORD of the hosts, saying, Behold the man whose name [is] The BRANCH; and he shall grow up out of his place, and he shall build the temple of the LORD.
He shall build the temple of the LORD, and he shall bear the glory and shall sit and rule upon his throne, and he shall be a priest upon his throne: and the counsel of peace shall be between them both.
And Helem and Tobijah and Jedaiah and Hen the son of Zephaniah shall have crowns for [a] memorial in the temple of the LORD.
And those [that are] far off shall come and build in the temple of the LORD, and ye shall know that the LORD of the hosts has sent me unto you. And [this] shall come to pass if ye will obediently hear the voice of the LORD our God.:

Now these [are] the names of the sons of Israel, who came into Egypt with Jacob; each one came in with his household.
Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah,
Issachar, Zebulun, and Benjamin,
Dan and Naphtali, Gad, and Asher.
And all the souls that came out of the loins of Jacob were seventy souls: for Joseph was in Egypt [already].
And Joseph died and all his brethren and all that generation.
And the sons of Israel were fruitful and increased abundantly and multiplied and waxed exceeding mighty; and the land was filled with them.
Now there arose up a new king over Egypt, who knew not Joseph.
And he said unto his people, Behold, the people of the sons of Israel [are] more and mightier than we.
Now, therefore, let us be wise concerning him, that he not multiply and it come to pass that when war comes, he shall also join with our enemies and fight against us and [so] leave the land.
Therefore they set taskmasters over them to afflict them with their burdens. And they built the supply cities for Pharaoh: Pithom and Raamses.
But the more they afflicted them, the more they multiplied and grew, so much that they loathed the sons of Israel.
And the Egyptians made the sons of Israel serve with rigor,
and they made their lives bitter with hard bondage, [making] mortar and brick and in all manner of service in the field; all their service, in which they made them serve, [was] with rigor.
And the king of Egypt spoke to the Hebrew midwives, one of whom was named Shiphrah and another [named] Puah;
and he said, When ye do the office of a midwife to the Hebrew women and see [the] sex, if it [is] a son, then ye shall kill him; but if it [is] a daughter, then she shall live.
But the midwives feared God and did not [do] as the king of Egypt commanded them but gave the men children their lives.
And the king of Egypt called for the midwives and said unto them, Why have ye done this thing and have given the men children their lives?
And the midwives said unto Pharaoh, Because the Hebrew women [are] not as the Egyptian women, for they [are] lively and are delivered before the midwives come in unto them.
Therefore God dealt well with the midwives, and the people multiplied and waxed very mighty.
And it came to pass because the midwives feared God, that he made them houses.
Then Pharaoh charged all his people, saying, Every son that is born ye shall cast into the river, and every daughter ye shall give them their lives.:

Therefore when we could wait no longer, we agreed to remain in Athens alone
and sent Timothy, our brother and minister of God [and our fellowlabourer] in the gospel of the Christ, to confirm you and to exhort you in your faith,
that no one should be moved in these tribulations, for you know that we are appointed for this.
For even when we were with you, we told you in advance that we must pass through tribulations, even as it has come to pass, and ye know.
For this cause I, also, not waiting any longer, have sent to know your faith, lest by some means the tempter has tempted you and our labour is in vain.
But now when Timothy came from you unto us and brought us good tidings of your faith and charity and that ye have good remembrance of us always, desiring greatly to see us, as we also [to see] you.
Therefore, brethren, we were comforted over you in all our tribulation and need by your faith;
for now we live, if ye stand fast in the Lord.
For what thanks can we render to God again for you for all the joy with which we joy for your sakes before our God,
night and day praying exceedingly that we might see your face and might complete that which is lacking in your faith?
Now [may] God himself and our Father and our Lord Jesus Christ direct our way unto you.
And the Lord make you to multiply and make charity to abound among you and toward all [men], even as it [is] with us toward you,
that your hearts may be confirmed in holiness, irreprehensible before God, even our Father, for the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ with all his saints.:

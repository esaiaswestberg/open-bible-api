So these three men ceased to answer Job because he [was] righteous in his own eyes.
Then the wrath of Elihu, the son of Barachel, the Buzite, of the kindred of Ram, was kindled; against Job was his wrath kindled, because he justified himself rather than God.
Also against his three friends was his wrath kindled because they had found no answer, and [yet] had condemned Job.
Now Elihu had waited until Job had spoken because they [were all] elder than he.
But when Elihu saw that [there was] no answer in the mouth of [these] three men, then his wrath was kindled.
And Elihu, the son of Barachel, the Buzite, answered and said, I [am] younger, and ye [are] older; therefore, I was afraid, and I feared to declare unto you my opinion.
I said, Days shall speak, and the multitude of years shall declare wisdom.
Certainly [there is] a spirit in man, and the inspiration of the Almighty gives them understanding.
Great men are not [always] wise; neither do the aged understand judgment.
Therefore I said, Hearken to me; I also will declare my knowledge.
Behold, I waited for your words; I gave ear to your arguments, while ye searched out what to say.
Even so, I attended unto you, and, behold, [there was] none of you to reproved Job [or] to answer his words.
Lest ye should say, We have found out wisdom; it is needful that God thrust him down, and not man.
Now he has not directed [his] words against me; neither will I answer him with your reasons.
They were amazed, they answered no more; they left off speaking.
And I waited, (for they did not speak, but stopped, [and] answered no more);
[I said], I will also answer my part, I will also declare my opinion.
For I am full of words; the spirit within me constrains me.
Behold, my belly [is] as wine [which] has no vent; it is ready to burst forth like spirits.
I will speak, that I may be able to breathe; I will open my lips and answer.
I will not now be a respecter of persons, neither will I give flattering titles unto man.
For I do not know [how] to give flattering titles; [otherwise] my maker would soon take me away.:

At this also my heart trembles and is moved out of its place.
Hear attentively his terrible voice and the word [that] goes out of his mouth.
He shall place it straight under the whole of the heavens, and his light [shall extend] unto the ends of the earth.
After it shall the sound roar; his valiant voice shall thunder; and he will not stay them even when his voice is heard.
God shall thunder marvelously with his voice; he does great things, which we cannot comprehend.
For he saith to the snow, Be thou [on] the earth; rain after rain, and rain after rain in his strength.
He seals up the hand of every man that all men may know his work.
Then the beast shall go into its lair and inhabit its dwelling.
Out of the south comes the whirlwind and cold out of the north wind.
By the breath of God ice is given; and the broad waters are constrained.
In addition to this, with clarity he wearies the thick clouds; and he scatters them with his light.
And they are turned round about by his counsels; that they may do whatever he commands them upon the face of the world in the earth.
On some occasions for correction, on others for his land, on others for mercy he causes them to appear.
Hearken unto this, Job; stand still, and consider the wondrous works of God.
Dost thou know when God disposed them and caused the light of his cloud to shine?
Dost thou know the balancings of the clouds, the wondrous works of the one who is perfect in knowledge?
How thy garments [are] warm, when he quiets the earth by the south [wind]?
Hast thou with him spread out the sky, [which is] strong [and] as a molten looking glass?
Teach us what we should say unto him; [for] we cannot order [our speech] by reason of darkness.
Shall it be told him when I speak? When someone is swallowed up shall it be told him?
Also, sometimes the clear light which [is] in the heavens is not seen, but the wind passes and cleanses them.
Fair weather comes out of the north; with God [is] terrible majesty.
[Touching] the Almighty, we cannot find him out; [he is] excellent in power and in judgment, and in plenty of righteousness he will not afflict.
Men, therefore, shall fear him; all the crafty of heart shall not see him.:

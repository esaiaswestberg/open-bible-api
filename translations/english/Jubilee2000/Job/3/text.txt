After this Job opened his mouth and cursed his day.
And Job spoke and said,
Let the day perish in which I was born and the night [in which] it was said, There is a man child conceived.
Let that day be darkness; let not God regard it from above; neither let the light shine upon it.
Let darkness and the shadow of death redeem it; let a cloud dwell upon it; let the blackness of the day terrify it.
As [for] that night, let darkness seize upon it; let it not be joined unto the days of the year; let it not come into the number of the months.
O, let that night be solitary; let no song come therein!
Let them curse it that curse the day, who are ready to raise up their mourning.
Let the stars of its dawn be darkened; they waited for light, but [have] none; neither let them see the dawning of the day;
because it did not shut up the doors of my [mother's] womb nor hide the misery from my eyes.
Why did I not die from the womb? [Why] did I [not] give up the spirit when I came out of the belly?
Why did the knees receive me? Of what use the breasts that I should suck?
For now I should have lain still and been quiet; I should have slept; then I would have been at rest,
with the kings and the counsellors of the earth, who built desolate places for themselves;
or with princes that had gold, who filled their houses with silver.
Or, [why] was I not hidden as an untimely birth, as infants [who] never saw light?
There the wicked cease [from] troubling; and there the weary are at rest.
[There] the prisoners rest together, they do not hear the voice of the oppressor.
The small and the great are there, and the servant [is] free from his master.
Why is light given to him that is in misery, and life unto the bitter [in] soul;
who long for death, but it [comes] not; and search for it more than for hid treasures;
who rejoice exceedingly [and] are glad when they can find the grave;
to the man who does not know which way he goes and whom God has hedged in?
For my sighing comes before I eat, and my roarings are poured out like the waters.
For the thing which I greatly feared is come upon me and that which I was afraid of is come unto me.
I never had prosperity, nor did I secure myself, neither was I at rest; yet trouble came.:

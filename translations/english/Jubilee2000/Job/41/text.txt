Canst thou draw out leviathan with a hook or with the cord [which] thou lettest down on his tongue?
Canst thou put a hook into his nose or bore his jaw through with a thorn?
Will he make many supplications unto thee? Will he speak soft [words] unto thee?
Will he make a covenant with thee that thou shall take him for a servant for ever?
Wilt thou play with him as [with] a bird, or wilt thou tie him up for thy maidens?
Shall the companions make a banquet of him? Shall they part him among the merchants?
Canst thou cut his skin with knives or his head with a fish spear?
Lay thine hand upon him; thou shalt remember the battle and do no more.
Behold, your hope [regarding] him shall fail; for even at the sight of him they shall faint.
No one [is so] bold as to dare stir him up; who then shall be able to stand before me?
Who has preceded me, that I should repay [him]? All that is under the whole heaven is mine.
I will not conceal his lies, nor his might, nor the beauty of his order.
Who shall uncover the face of his garment? [Or] who shall come to him with a double bridle?
Who shall open the doors of his face? The orders of his teeth [are] terrible.
His scales [are his] pride, shut up together [as with] a close seal.
One is so near to another, that no air can come between them.
They are joined one to another; they stick together, that they cannot be separated.
By his sneezings lights are lit, and his eyes [are] like the eyelids of the morning.
Out of his mouth go burning lamps, [and] sparks of fire leap out.
Out of his nostrils goes forth smoke, as [out] of a seething pot or caldron.
His breath kindles coals, and a flame goes out of his mouth.
In his neck dwells strength, and before him the work is undone.
The failings of his flesh are joined together; [his flesh] is firm in him and does not move.
His heart is as firm as a stone; as hard as a piece of the lower [millstone].
Of his greatness, the mighty are afraid; by reason of breakings they remove sin from themselves.
When one catches up to him, no sword or spear or dart or coat of mail shall endure [against him].
He esteems iron as straw [and] bronze as rotten wood.
The arrow cannot make him flee; with him, slingstones are turned into stubble.
He counts any weapon as stubble; he laughs at the shaking of a spear.
Broken clay vessels [are] under him; he carves his imprint upon the mire.
He makes the deep to boil like a pot; he makes the sea like a pot of ointment.
He makes the path shine after him; [one] would think the deep [to be] hoary.
Upon earth there is not his like, who behaves without fear.
He despises all exalted [things]; he is king over all the sons of pride.:

Surely there is a mine for the silver, and a place for gold [where] they refine [it].
Iron is taken out of the dust, and bronze [is] melted [out of] the stone.
He set a border unto the darkness, and unto every perfect work that he made, he [placed] a stone of darkness and shadow of death.
The river breaks forth next to the inhabitant; [even the waters] forgotten of the foot, that were higher than man, are gone away.
Land out of which bread comes forth, and underneath it shall be as [if] it were converted in fire.
A place where its stones shall be sapphires; and it shall have dust of gold.

God understands its way, and he [alone] knows its place.
For he looks unto the ends of the earth [and] sees under the whole heaven,
To make a weight for the wind and to supply water by measure,
when he made a law for the rain, and a way for the lightning of the thunders.
Then he saw it and counted it; he prepared it and also searched it out.

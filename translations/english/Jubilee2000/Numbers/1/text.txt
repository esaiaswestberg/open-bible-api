Only thou shalt not number the tribe of Levi, neither take the sum of them among the sons of Israel;
But thou shalt place the Levites in the tabernacle of the testimony and over all the vessels thereof and over all things that [belong] to it; they shall bear the tabernacle and all the vessels thereof; and they shall minister in it and shall encamp round about the tabernacle.
And when the tabernacle departs, the Levites shall take it down; and when the tabernacle is to be pitched, the Levites shall set it up; and the stranger that comes near shall be put to death.
And the sons of Israel shall pitch their tents, each man by his own camp and each man by his own standard, throughout their hosts.
But the Levites shall pitch round about the tabernacle of the testimony that there be no wrath upon the congregation of the sons of Israel; and the Levites shall keep the charge of the tabernacle of the testimony.
And the sons of Israel did according to all that the LORD commanded Moses, so did they.:

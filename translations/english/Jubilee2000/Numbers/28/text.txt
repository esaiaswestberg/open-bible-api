And the LORD spoke unto Moses, saying,
Command the sons of Israel and say unto them, My offering, my bread with my offerings on fire, [for] an acceptable savour unto me, shall ye observe to offer unto me in their due season.
And thou shalt say unto them, This [is] the offering on fire which ye shall offer unto the LORD; two lambs of the first year without spot each day, [for] a continual burnt offering.
The one lamb shalt thou offer in the morning, and the other lamb shalt thou offer between the two evenings,
and a tenth [part] of an ephah of flour, mingled with the fourth [part] of a hin of beaten oil as a present.
[It is] a continual burnt offering, which was ordained in Mount Sinai for an acceptable savour, an offering on fire unto the LORD.
And the drink offering thereof [shall be] the fourth [part] of a hin with each lamb; thou shalt pour out the drink offering of [superior] wine unto the LORD in the sanctuary.
And the other lamb shalt thou offer between the two evenings; according to the offering of the morning and according to the drink offering thereof, thou shalt offer [it], an offering on fire, of an acceptable savour unto the LORD.
But on the sabbath day two lambs of the first year without spot and two tenth deals of flour mingled with oil, for a present, with the drink offering thereof:
[This is] the burnt offering of the sabbath, besides the continual burnt offering and its drink offering.
And in the beginnings of your months ye shall offer a burnt offering unto the LORD: two young bullocks, and one ram, seven lambs of the first year without spot;
and three tenth deals of flour mingled with oil, as a present with each bullock; and two tenth deals of flour mingled with oil, as a present with each ram;
and a tenth deal of flour mingled with oil in offering as a present with each lamb; a burnt offering of an acceptable savour, a sacrifice on fire unto the LORD.
And their drink offerings shall be half a hin of wine with each bullock and the third [part] of a hin with each ram and a fourth [part] of a hin with each lamb. This [shall be] the burnt offering of each month throughout all the months of the year.
And one he goat as [the] sin shall be offered unto the LORD, besides the continual burnt offering and its drink offering.
But on the fourteenth of the first month [shall be] the passover of the LORD.
And in the fifteenth day of this month [is] the feast; seven days shall unleavened bread be eaten.
In the first day [shall be] a holy convocation; ye shall do no manner of servile work [therein].
And ye shall offer a sacrifice on fire [for] a burnt offering unto the LORD: two young bullocks and one ram and seven lambs of the first year; they shall be unto you without blemish;
and their present [shall be of] flour mingled with oil; three tenth deals shall ye offer with each bullock and two tenth deals with each ram;
a tenth deal shalt thou offer with each of the seven lambs;
and one he goat as [the] sin, to reconcile you.
Ye shall offer these besides the burnt offering in the morning, which [is] the continual burnt offering.
After this manner ye shall offer daily throughout the seven days, the bread of the sacrifice on fire, of an acceptable savour unto the LORD; it shall be offered besides the continual burnt offering and its drink offering.
And on the seventh day ye shall have a holy convocation; ye shall do no servile work.
Also in the day of the firstfruits, when ye offer a new present unto the LORD in your [fulfilled] weeks, ye shall have a holy convocation; ye shall do no servile work.
But ye shall offer in burnt offering, in an acceptable savour unto the LORD: two young bullocks, one ram, seven lambs of the first year;
and their present of flour mingled with oil, three tenth deals with each bullock, two tenth deals with each ram,
a tenth deal with each of the seven lambs;
[and] one he goat, to reconcile you.
Ye shall offer [them] besides the continual burnt offering and its presents and their drink offerings; they shall be unto you without blemish.:

There were present at the same time some that told him of the Galilaeans whose blood Pilate had mingled with his sacrifices.
And Jesus, answering, said unto them, Think ye that these Galilaeans suffered such things because they were greater sinners than all the [other] Galilaeans?
I tell you, No; but, except ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish.
Or those eighteen upon whom the tower in Siloam fell and slew them, think ye that they were greater debtors than [all the other] men that dwelt in Jerusalem?
I tell you, No; but, except ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish.
And He spoke this parable: A certain [man] had a fig tree planted in his vineyard, and he came and sought fruit upon it and found none.
Then he said unto the dresser of his vineyard, Behold, these three years I come seeking fruit on this fig tree and find none; cut it down; why does it cumber the ground?
And he, answering, said unto him, Lord, let it alone this year also until I shall dig about it and dung [it],
and if it bears fruit, [well]; and if not, [then] after that thou shalt cut it down.
And he was teaching in one of the synagogues on the sabbath.
And, behold, there was a woman who had a spirit of infirmity eighteen years and was bowed together and could in no wise lift [herself] up.
And when Jesus saw her, he called [her] and said unto her, Woman, thou art loosed from thine infirmity.
And he laid [his] hands on her, and immediately she was made straight and glorified God.
And the prince of the synagogue answered with indignation because Jesus had healed on the sabbath, and said unto the people, There are six days in which it behooves [men] to work; in them therefore come and be healed, and not on the sabbath day.
The Lord then answered him and said, [Thou] hypocrite, does not each one of you on the sabbath loose his ox or [his] ass from the stall and lead [it] away to drink?
And [regarding] this daughter of Abraham, who, behold, Satan had bound eighteen years, does it not behoove [us] to release her from this bond on the Sabbath day?
And as he said these things, all his adversaries were ashamed, but all the people rejoiced for all the glorious things that were done by him.
Then said he, Unto what is the kingdom of God like? and unto what shall I compare it?
It is like a grain of mustard seed, which a man took and cast into his garden; and it grew and waxed a great tree; and the fowls of the heaven lodged in the branches of it.
And again he said, Unto what shall I compare the kingdom of God?
It is like leaven which a woman took and hid in three measures of meal until the whole was leavened.
And he went through the cities and villages, teaching and journeying toward Jerusalem.
Then someone said unto him, Lord, are there few that are saved? And he said unto them,
Strive to enter in at the narrow gate; for many, I say unto you, will seek to enter in and shall not be able.
When once the husband of the house is risen up and shall have shut the door, and ye begin to stand without and to knock at the door, saying, Lord, Lord, open unto us; and he shall answer and say unto you, I know you not from where ye are,
then shall ye begin to say, We have eaten and drunk in thy presence, and thou hast taught in our streets.
But he shall say unto you, I know you not from where ye are; depart from me, all [ye] workers of iniquity.
In that place shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth when ye shall see Abraham and Isaac and Jacob and all the prophets in the kingdom of God, and you [yourselves] thrust out.
And [others] shall come from the east and [from] the west and from the north and [from] the south and shall sit [at the table] in the kingdom of God.
And, behold, there are last which shall be first, and there are first which shall be last.
The same day there came certain of the Pharisees, saying unto him, Go out and depart from here, for Herod will kill thee.
And he said unto them, Go ye and tell that fox, Behold, I cast out demons, and I do cures today and tomorrow, and the third [day] I shall be perfected.
Nevertheless I must walk today and tomorrow and the [day] following, for it cannot be that a prophet perish out of Jerusalem.
O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, which kills the prophets and stones those that are sent unto thee, how often would I have gathered thy children together as a hen [gathers] her brood under [her] wings, and ye would not!
Behold, your house is left unto you desolate; and verily I say unto you, Ye shall not see me until [the time] comes when ye shall say, Blessed [is] he that comes in the name of the Lord.:

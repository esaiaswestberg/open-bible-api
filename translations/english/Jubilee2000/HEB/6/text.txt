Therefore, leaving now the word of the beginning [of the establishment] of the Christ, let us go on unto perfection, not laying again the foundation of repentance from works of death, and of faith in God,
of the doctrine of [the] baptisms, and of [the] laying on of hands, and of [the] resurrection of the dead, and of eternal judgment.
And this we will indeed do, if God permits.
For [it is] impossible that those who once received the light and tasted of that heavenly gift and were made partakers of the Holy Spirit
and likewise have tasted the good word of God and the virtue of the age to come,
and have backslidden, be renewed again by repentance, crucifying again for themselves the Son of God and putting him to an open shame.
For the earth which drinks in the rain that comes often upon it and brings forth herbs in season for those by whom it is dressed receives blessing from God;
but that which bears thorns and briers [is] rejected and [is] near unto cursing, whose end [shall be] by fire.
But, beloved, we expect better things than these of you, [things] near unto saving health, though we thus speak.
For God [is] not unjust to forget your work and labour of charity which ye have showed in his name, having helped the saints and helping them.
But we desire that each one of you show the same diligence until the end for the fulfillment of [your] hope,
that ye not become slothful, but imitators of those who by faith and patience inherit the promises.
For when God promised unto Abraham, because he could swear by no greater, he swore by himself,
saying, Surely blessing I will bless thee and multiplying I will multiply thee.
And so, after he had patiently endured, he obtained the promise.
For men verily swear by the greater, and an oath for confirmation [is] to them an end of all controversy.
In which God, desiring to show more abundantly unto the heirs of promise the immutability of his counsel, confirmed [it] by an oath,
that by two immutable things, in which [it is] impossible for God to lie, we might have a strong consolation, who have fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope set before us,
which we have as an anchor of the soul, both sure and steadfast, and which enters even [into] that which is within the veil,
where [our] precursor, Jesus, has entered for us [and is] made high priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec.:

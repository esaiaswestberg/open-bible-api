And the LORD spoke unto Moses, saying,
See, I have called by name Bezaleel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah;
and I have filled him with the Spirit of God, in wisdom and in intelligence and in science and in all manner of workmanship,
to devise cunning works, to work in gold and in silver and in brass,
and in cutting of stones, to set [them], and in carving of timber, to work in all manner of workmanship.
And I, behold, I have given with him Aholiab, the son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan; and in the desire of all that are wise hearted I have put wisdom that they may make all that I have commanded thee:
The tabernacle of the testimony and the ark of the testimony and the seat of reconciliation that [shall be] upon it and all the vessels of the tabernacle
and the table and its vessels and the pure candlestick with all its vessels and the altar of incense,
and the altar of burnt offering with all its vessels and the laver and its base
and the clothes of service and the holy garments for Aaron the priest and the garments of his sons that they may be priests,
and the anointing oil and aromatic incense for the sanctuary; they shall do according to all that I have commanded thee.
And the LORD spoke further unto Moses, saying,
And thou shalt speak unto the sons of Israel, saying, With all this ye shall keep my sabbaths; for it [is] a sign between me and you throughout your ages; that [ye] may know that I [am] the LORD that doth sanctify you.
Ye shall keep the sabbath therefore; for it [is] holy unto you; those that defile it shall surely be put to death; for whoever does [any] work therein, that soul shall be cut off from among his people.
Six days shall work be done; but the seventh, the sabbath of rest, [shall be] holy to the LORD; whoever does [any] work in the sabbath day shall surely be put to death.
Therefore the sons of Israel shall keep the sabbath, to observe the sabbath throughout their ages [for] a perpetual covenant.
It [is] a sign between me and the sons of Israel for ever; for [in] six days the LORD made the heavens and the earth, and on the seventh day he rested and was refreshed.
And he gave unto Moses, when he finished speaking with him upon mount Sinai, two tables of the testimony, tables of stone, written with the finger of God.:

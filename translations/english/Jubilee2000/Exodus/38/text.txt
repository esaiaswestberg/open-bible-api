And he made the altar of burnt offering [of] cedar wood: five cubits [was] its length and five cubits its breadth; [it was] square, and its height [was] three cubits.
And he made its horns on the four corners of it; its horns were of the same piece; and he covered it with brass.
He made likewise all the vessels of the altar: the pots and the shovels and the basins [and] the fleshhooks, and the firepans; all its vessels he made [of] brass.
And he made for the altar the brasen grate of network under the circumference thereof beneath unto the midst of it.
He also cast four rings for the four ends of the grate of brass, [to be] places for the staves.
And he made the staves [of] cedar wood and covered them with brass.
And he put the staves into the rings on the sides of the altar, to bear it with; he made the altar hollow with boards.
He also made the laver [of] brass and the base of it [of] brass, of the looking glasses of [the women] who were vigilant [at] the door of the tabernacle of the testimony.
He made the court likewise; on the south side towards the Negev the hangings of the court [were of] fine twined linen, one hundred cubits;
their pillars [were] twenty with their twenty brasen sockets; the capitals of the pillars and their fillets [were of] silver.
And for the side of the Aquilon, [the hangings were] one hundred cubits, their pillars twenty with their twenty sockets of brass, the capitals of the pillars and their fillets [of] silver.
On the west side [were] hangings of fifty cubits, their pillars ten and their sockets ten, the capitals of the pillars and their fillets [of] silver,
and for the east side eastward fifty cubits
the hangings of the one side fifteen cubits, their pillars three, and their sockets three;
and for the other side of the court gate, on this hand and that hand, [were] hangings of fifteen cubits, their pillars three and their sockets three.
All the hangings of the court round about [were] of fine twined linen.
And the sockets for the pillars [were of] brass, the capitals of the pillars and their fillets [of] silver and the coverings of their heads [of] silver; likewise all the pillars of the court [were] filleted with silver.
And the hanging for the gate of the court [was] needlework [of] blue, purple, scarlet, and fine twined linen; twenty cubits [was] the length, and the height in the breadth [was] five cubits, the same as the hangings of the court.
And its pillars [were] four with its four sockets [of] brass, their capitals [of] silver, and the coverings of their heads and their fillets [of] silver.
And all the stakes of the tabernacle and of the court round about [were of] brass.
This is the sum of the tabernacle, [even] of the tabernacle of testimony, as it was counted, according to the commandment of Moses, [for] the ministry of the Levites, by the hand of Ithamar, son to Aaron the priest.
And Bezaleel, the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah, made all that the LORD commanded Moses.
And with him [was] Aholiab, son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan, a master workman, an engineer, and an embroiderer in blue and in purple and in scarlet and fine linen.
All the gold that was occupied for the work in all the work of the sanctuary, which was gold of offering, was twenty-nine talents and seven hundred and thirty shekels, according to the shekel of the sanctuary.
And the silver of those that were numbered of the congregation [was] one hundred talents and one thousand seven hundred and seventy-five shekels, according to the shekel of the sanctuary:
A half per head, [that is], half a shekel, according to the shekel of the sanctuary, for every one that went to be numbered, from twenty years old and upward, [which were] six hundred and three thousand five hundred and fifty.
And of the hundred talents of silver were cast the sockets of the sanctuary and the sockets of the veil: one hundred sockets of the hundred talents, a talent for a socket.
And of the thousand seven hundred seventy-five shekels he made the capitals for the pillars and covered their heads and filleted them.
And the brass of the offering [was] seventy talents and two thousand four hundred shekels,
with which he made the sockets to the door of the tabernacle of the testimony and the brasen altar and the brasen grate for it and all the vessels of the altar
and the sockets of the court round about and the sockets of the court gate and all the stakes of the tabernacle, and all the stakes of the court round about.:

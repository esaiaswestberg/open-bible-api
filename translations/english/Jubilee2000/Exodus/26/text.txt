Moreover thou shalt make the tabernacle [with] ten curtains [of] fine twined linen and blue and purple and scarlet; [with] cherubim of cunning work shalt thou make them.
The length of one curtain [shall be] twenty-eight cubits, and the breadth of one curtain four cubits; and all the curtains shall have one measure.
The five curtains shall be coupled together one to another, and the [other] five curtains [shall be] coupled one to another.
And thou shalt make loops of blue upon the edge of the one curtain from the border in the coupling; and likewise shalt thou make in the uttermost edge of [another] curtain in the coupling of the second.
Fifty loops shalt thou make in the one curtain, and fifty loops shalt thou make in the border of the curtain that [is] in the second coupling; that the loops may take hold one of another.
And thou shalt make fifty hooks of gold and couple the curtains together with the hooks; and it shall be one tabernacle.
Likewise thou shalt make curtains of goats' [hair] to be a covering over the tabernacle; eleven curtains shalt thou make.
The length of one curtain [shall be] thirty cubits, and the breadth of one curtain four cubits; and the eleven curtains [shall be all] of one measure.
And thou shalt couple five curtains by themselves, and six curtains by themselves, and shalt double the sixth curtain in the forefront of the tabernacle.
And thou shalt make fifty loops on the edge of the one curtain from the border in the coupling and fifty loops in the edge of the curtain which couples the second.
And thou shalt make fifty hooks of brass and put the hooks into the loops and couple the tent together that it may be one.
And the remnant that remains of the curtains of the tent, the half curtain that remains, shall hang over the backside of the tabernacle.
And a cubit on the one side and a cubit on the other side of that which remains in the length of the curtains of the tent, it shall hang over the sides of the tabernacle on this side and on that side, to cover it.
And thou shalt make a covering for the tent [of] rams' skins dyed red and a covering above [of] badgers' skins.
And thou shalt make boards for the tabernacle [of] cedar wood standing up.
Ten cubits [shall be] the length of a board, and a cubit and a half [shall be] the breadth of one board.
Two tenons [shall there be] in one board, set in order one against another; thus shalt thou make for all the boards of the tabernacle.
And thou shalt make the boards for the tabernacle, twenty boards on the side of the Negev to the south.
And thou shalt make forty sockets of silver under the twenty boards, two sockets under one board for its two tenons and two sockets under another board for its two tenons.
And for the second side of the tabernacle on the side of the Aquilon, [there shall be] twenty boards
and their forty sockets [of] silver: two sockets under one board and two sockets under another board.
And for the sides of the tabernacle westward, thou shalt make six boards.
And two boards shalt thou make for the corners of the tabernacle in the two sides,
and they shall be coupled together beneath, and they shall be coupled together above the head of it unto one ring; thus shall it be for them both; they shall be for the two corners.
Thus they shall be eight boards, and their sockets [of] silver, sixteen sockets: two sockets under one board and two sockets under another board.
And thou shalt make five bars [of] cedar wood for the boards of the one side of the tabernacle,
five bars for the boards of the other side of the tabernacle, and five bars for the boards of the side of the tabernacle, for the two sides westward.
And the middle bar in the midst of the boards shall reach from end to end.
And thou shalt cover the boards with gold and make their rings [of] gold [for] places for the bars, and thou shalt also cover the bars with gold.
And thou shalt raise up the tabernacle according to the fashion thereof which was showed thee in the mount.
And thou shalt also make a veil [of] blue, purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen of cunning work; with cherubim shall it be made;
and thou shalt hang it upon four pillars of cedar covered with gold; their capitals [shall be of] gold upon four sockets of silver.
And thou shalt hang up the veil under the hooks, and thou shalt bring in there, inside the veil, the ark of the testimony; and that veil shall separate for you between the holy [place] and the holy of holies.
And thou shalt put the seat of reconciliation upon the ark of the testimony in the holy of holies.
And thou shalt set the table outside the veil, the candlestick over against the table on the side of the tabernacle toward the Negev ([south desert]), and thou shalt put the table on the side of the Aquilon ([north wind]).
And thou shalt make a hanging for the door of the tabernacle [of] blue, purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen wrought with needlework.
And thou shalt make for the hanging five pillars of cedar and cover them with gold, [and] their capitals [shall be of] gold, and thou shalt cast five sockets of brass for them.:

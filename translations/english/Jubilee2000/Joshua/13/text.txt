Now [when] Joshua was old [and] advanced in years, the LORD said unto him, Thou art old [and] advanced in years, and there remains yet very much land to be possessed.
This [is] the land that yet remains: all the borders of the Philistines and all Geshuri
from the Nile, which [is] before Egypt, even unto the borders of Ekron northward, [which] is counted among the Canaanites; five cardinals of the Philistines; the Gazathites and the Ashdothites, the Eshkalonites, the Gittites, and the Ekronites, also the Avites;
towards the Negev all the land of the Canaanites and Mearah that [is] beside those of Sidon unto Aphek to the border of the Amorite;
and the land of the Giblites and all Lebanon toward the sunrising, from Baalgad at the root of mount Hermon unto the entering into Hamath.
All the inhabitants of the mountains from Lebanon unto the hot springs [and] all the Sidonians, them will I drive out from before the sons of Israel; only thou shalt divide the country by lot unto the Israelites for an inheritance, as I have commanded thee.
Now therefore divide this land for an inheritance unto the nine tribes and the half tribe of Manasseh,
for the other half received their inheritance with the Reubenites and the Gadites, which Moses gave them of the other side of the Jordan eastward, according as Moses the servant of the LORD gave them;
from Aroer, that [is] upon the bank of the river Arnon, and the city that [is] in the midst of the river and all the plain of Medeba unto Dibon;
and all the cities of Sihon, king of the Amorites, who reigned in Heshbon, unto the borders of the sons of Ammon;
and Gilead and the borders of the Geshur and Maachath and all mount Hermon and all Bashan unto Salcah;
all the kingdom of Og in Bashan, who reigned in Ashtaroth and in Edrei, who remained of the remnant of the Rephaim, for these did Moses smite and cast them out [of the land].
Nevertheless, the sons of Israel did not expel those of Geshur and Maachath, but Geshur and Maachath dwell among the Israelites until this day.
But unto the tribe of Levi he gave no inheritance; the sacrifices on fire of the LORD God of Israel are their inheritance, as he said unto them.
And Moses gave unto the tribe of the sons of Reuben according to their families,
and their border was from Aroer, that [is] on the bank of the river Arnon, and the city that [is] in the midst of the river and all the plain until Medeba,
Heshbon and all her cities that [are] in the plain, Dibon, and Bamothbaal and Bethbaalmeon,
and Jahazah and Kedemoth and Mephaath,
and Kirjathaim and Sibmah and Zarethshahar in the mount of the valley,
and Bethpeor and Ashdothpisgah and Bethjeshimoth,
and all the cities of the plain and all the kingdom of Sihon, king of the Amorites, who reigned in Heshbon, whom Moses smote with the princes of Midian, Evi, and Rekem, and Zur and Hur and Reba, [who were] princes of Sihon, dwelling in the country.
Balaam also, the son of Beor, the diviner, did the sons of Israel slay with the sword among those that were slain by them.
And the border of the sons of Reuben was the Jordan and the border [thereof]. This [was] the inheritance of the sons of Reuben according to their families, these cities with their villages.
Moses likewise gave unto the tribe of Gad, to the sons of Gad according to their families.
And their border was Jazer, and all the cities of Gilead and half of the land of the sons of Ammon, unto Aroer that [is] before Rabbah,
and from Heshbon unto Ramathmizpeh, and Betonim, and from Mahanaim unto the border of Debir,
and the valley of Betharam and Bethnimrah and Succoth and Zaphon, the rest of the kingdom of Sihon, king of Heshbon, the Jordan and its border, [even] unto the edge of the sea of Chinnereth on the other side of the Jordan eastward.
This [is] the inheritance of the sons of Gad according to their families, these cities with their villages.
And Moses also gave unto the half tribe of Manasseh, and it belonged to the half tribe of the sons of Manasseh according to their families.
Their border was from Mahanaim, all Bashan, all the kingdom of Og king of Bashan, and all the towns of Jair, which [are] in Bashan, sixty cities.
And half of Gilead and Ashtaroth and Edrei, cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan, [were given] to the sons of Machir, the son of Manasseh, [even] to one half of the sons of Machir, according to their families.
This is what Moses distributed in inheritance in the plains of Moab, on the other side of the Jordan of Jericho, eastward.
But to the tribe of Levi Moses did not give [any] inheritance; the LORD God of Israel is their inheritance, as he said unto them.:

In the twenty-fifth year of our captivity, in the beginning of the year, in the tenth [day] of the month, in the fourteenth year after the city was smitten, in that same day the hand of the LORD was upon me, and brought me there.
In the visions of God he brought me into the land of Israel and set me upon a very high mountain, upon which [was] as the frame of a city to the south.
And he brought me there, and, behold, [there was] a man, whose appearance [was] like the appearance of brass, with a line of flax in his hand, and a measuring reed; and he stood in the gate.
And the man said unto me, Son of man, behold with thine eyes and hear with thine ears and set thine heart upon all that I show thee for to the intent that I might show [them] unto thee [art] thou brought here: declare all that thou dost see to the house of Israel.
And behold a wall on the outside of the house, and the measuring reed which that man had in his hand, was six cubits [long], of a cubit and a hand breadth; so he measured the breadth of the building, one reed; and the height, one reed.
Then he came unto the gate which looks toward the east and went up the stairs thereof and measured the post of the gate, [which was] one reed broad; and the other post [of the gate], [which was] one reed broad.
And [each] chamber [was] one reed long and one reed broad; and between the chambers [were] five cubits; and [each] post of the gate by the porch of the gate within [was] one reed.
He also measured the porch of the gate within, one reed.
Then he measured the entrance of the portal, eight cubits; and its posts, two cubits; and the entrance of the portal within.
And the gate eastward [had] three chambers on each side, they three [were] of one measure; and the portals were also of one measure on each side.
And he measured the breadth of the entry of the gate, ten cubits; [and] the length of the portal, thirteen cubits.
The space also before the chambers [was] one cubit [on this side], and the space [was] one cubit on that side; and the chambers [were] six cubits on this side, and six cubits on that side.
He measured then the gate from the roof of [one] chamber to the roof of another; the breadth [was] twenty-five cubits, door against door.
He also made the portals of sixty cubits, each portal of the court and of the portal all around.
And from the face of the gate of the entrance unto the face of the porch of the inner gate [were] fifty cubits.
And [there were] narrow windows in the chambers, and in their portals within the gate round about, and likewise in the arches; and the windows [were] round about inward; and upon [each] post [were] palm trees.
Then he brought me into the outer court, and, behold, [there were] chambers and a pavement made for the court round about; thirty chambers [were] in that court.
And the lower pavement [was] paved to the side of the gates, in proportion to the length of the portals.
Then he measured the breadth from the forefront of the lower gate unto the forefront of the inner court without, one hundred cubits eastward and northward.
And the gate of the outer court that looked toward the north, he measured the length thereof and the breadth thereof.
And its chambers [were] three on this side and three on that side; and its posts and its arches were after the measure of the first gate; its length [was] fifty cubits, and its breadth twenty-five cubits.
And their windows and their arches and their palm trees [were] after the measure of the gate that looks toward the east; and they went up unto it by seven steps; and its arches [were] before them.
And the gate of the inner court [was] over against the gate toward the north and toward the east; and he measured from gate to gate one hundred cubits.
After that he brought me toward the south, and behold a gate toward the south; and he measured its portals and its arches according to these measures.
And [there were] windows in it and in its arches round about, like those windows; the length [was] fifty cubits, and the breadth twenty-five cubits.
And [there were] seven steps to go up to it, and its arches [were] before them; and it had palm trees, one on this side and another on that side, upon the posts thereof.
And [thus was the] gate in the inner court toward the south; and he measured from gate to gate toward the south one hundred cubits.
And he brought me to the inner court by the south gate; and he measured the south gate according to these measures;
and its chambers, and its posts and its arches according to these measures; and [there were] windows in it and in its arches round about; [it was] fifty cubits long and twenty-five cubits broad.
And the arches round about [were] twenty-five cubits long and five cubits broad.
And its arches [went] into the court outside, with palm trees upon [each of] its posts; and the going up to it [had] eight steps.
And he brought me into the inner court toward the east; and he measured the gate according to these measures.
And its chambers and its posts and its arches [were] according to these measures; and [there were] windows therein and in its arches round about; [it was] fifty cubits long and twenty-five cubits broad.
And its arches [went] into the court outside, with palm trees upon [each of] its posts, on this side and on that side; and the going up to it [had] eight steps.
Then he brought me to the north gate and measured [it] according to these measures;
its chambers, its posts and its arches and the windows to it round about: the length [was] fifty cubits and the breadth twenty-five cubits.
And its posts [were] toward the outer court; with palm trees upon [each of] its posts, on this side and on that side: and the going up to it [had] eight steps.
And [there was] a chamber and its gate with posts of portals, there they shall wash the burnt offering.
And in the porch of the gate [were] two tables on this side and two tables on that side, to slay the burnt offering upon and the sin and the guilt.
And to the outside of the steps at the entry of the north gate [were] two tables; and on the other side, which [was] at the porch of the gate, [were] two tables.
Four tables [were] on this side, and four tables on that side, by the side of this gate; eight tables, upon which they slew [their sacrifices].
And the four tables [were] of hewn stone for the burnt offering, of a cubit and a half long, and a cubit and a half broad, and one cubit high; upon which they also laid the instruments with which they slew the burnt offering and the sacrifice.
And within [were] hooks, a hand broad, fastened round about; and upon the tables [was] the flesh of the offering.
And outside the inner gate [were] the chambers of the singers in the inner court, which [was] at the side of the north gate; and they faced toward the south, one at the side of the east gate facing toward the north.
And he said unto me, This chamber facing toward the south [shall be] for the priests, the keepers of the charge of the house.
And the chamber facing toward the north [shall be] for the priests, the keepers of the charge of the altar; these [are] the sons of Zadok who are called from the sons of Levi to minister to the LORD.
So he measured the court, one hundred cubits long and one hundred cubits broad, foursquare; and the altar [that was] before the house.
And he brought me to the porch of the house and measured [each] post of the porch five cubits on this side and five cubits on that side; and the breadth of the gate [was] three cubits on this side and three cubits on that side.
The length of the porch [was] twenty cubits, and the breadth eleven cubits, into which they went in by steps; and [there were] pillars by the posts, one on this side and another on that side.:

The rich and poor meet together; the LORD [is] the maker of them all.
A prudent [man] foresees the evil and hides himself, but the simple pass on and receive hurt.
Riches and honour and life [are] the remuneration of humility and of the fear of the LORD.
Thorns [and] snares [are] in the way of the perverse; he that keeps his soul shall be far from them.

He that has a merciful eye shall be blessed, for he gives of his bread to the destitute.
Cast out the scorner, and contention shall go out; strife and reproach shall cease.
He that loves pureness of heart, [for] the grace of his lips the king [shall be] his friend.

Bow down thine ear and hear the words of the wise, and apply thine heart unto my wisdom.
For [it is] a delightful thing if thou keep them within thee; they shall be ordered together in thy lips.
That thy trust may be in the LORD, I have made known to thee this day, even to thee.
Have I not written unto thee three times in counsels and knowledge,
that I might make thee know the certainty of the words of truth, that thou mightest answer the words of truth to those that send unto thee?
Rob not the poor, because he [is] poor: neither destroy the destitute in judgment:
For the LORD will judge their cause and spoil the soul of those that spoiled them.
Do not meddle with an angry man, and with a furious man thou shalt not go:
Lest thou learn his ways and get a snare to thy soul.

Remove not the ancient landmark, which thy fathers have set.

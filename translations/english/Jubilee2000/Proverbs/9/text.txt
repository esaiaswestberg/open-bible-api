Wisdom has built her house; she has hewn out her seven pillars:
She has killed her sacrifice; she has mingled her wine; and she has furnished her table.
She has sent forth her maidens; she cries upon the highest places of the city,
whosoever [is] simple, let him turn in here; [as for] those that lack understanding, she saith unto him,
Come, eat of my bread, and drink of the wine [which] I have mingled.
Forsake that which is foolish and live and go in the way of understanding.
He that chastens a scorner brings shame unto himself, and he that chastens a wicked [man brings] himself a blot.
Chasten not a scorner lest he hate thee; chasten a wise man, and he will love thee.
Give [instruction] to a wise [man], and he will be yet wiser; teach a just [man], and he will increase in learning.
The fear of the LORD [is] the beginning of wisdom, and the knowledge of the holy [is] understanding.
For by me thy days shall be multiplied, and the years of thy life shall be increased.
If thou be wise, thou shalt be wise for thyself; but [if] thou scornest, thou alone shalt bear [it].
A foolish woman [is] clamorous: [she is] simple and knows nothing.
For she sits at the door of her house on a seat in the high places of the city
to call to those who pass by the way, to those who straighten their ways;
Whosoever [is] simple, let him turn in here; and [as for] him that lacks understanding, she saith unto him:
Stolen waters are sweet, and bread [eaten] in secret is pleasant.
But he does not know that the dead [are] there [and that] her guests [are] in the depths of Sheol.:

The words of Agur the son of Jakeh, [even] the prophecy: the man spoke unto Ithiel, even unto Ithiel and Ucal,
Surely I [am] more carnal than [any] man and have not the understanding of a man.
I neither learned wisdom nor have the knowledge of the holy.
Who has ascended up into heaven, or descended? who has gathered the wind in his fists? who has bound the waters in a garment? who has established all the ends of the earth? what [is] his name, and what [is] his son's name, if thou canst tell?
Every word of God [is] pure: he [is] a shield unto those that put their trust in him.
Do not add unto his words, lest he reprove thee, and thou be found a liar.
Two [things] have I required of thee; do not deny me [them] before I die:
Remove far from me vanity and lies: give me neither poverty nor riches; feed me with the bread of my judgment:
Lest I be full, and deny [thee], and say, Who [is] the LORD? or lest I be poor, and steal, and blaspheme the name of my God.
Do not accuse a servant in the presence of his master, lest he curse thee, and thou be found guilty.
[There is] a generation [that] curses their father, and does not bless their mother.
[There is] a generation [that are] pure in their own eyes, and [yet] is not washed from their filthiness.
[There is] a generation, O how lofty are their eyes! and their eyelids are lifted up.
[There is] a generation, whose teeth [are as] swords, and their molars [as] knives, to devour the poor from off the earth, and the destitute from [among] men.
The horseleach has two daughters, [which are called], Give, give. There are three [things that] are never satisfied, [yea], four [things] say not, [It is] enough:
Sheol; and the barren womb; the earth [that] is not filled with water; and the fire [that] never says, [It is] enough.
The eye [that] mocks at [his] father, and despises the teaching of [his] mother, the ravens shall pluck it out of the river, and the young eagles shall eat it.
There are three [things which] are hidden from me, [yea], four which I know not:
The track of the eagle in the air; the track of the serpent upon the rock; the track of the ship in the midst of the sea; and the track of the man in the maid.
Such [is] the track of an adulterous woman; she eats, and wipes her mouth, and says, I have done no wickedness.
For three [things] the earth is disquieted, and the fourth it cannot bear:
For a servant when he reigns; and a fool when he is filled with bread;
for a rejected [woman] when she is married; and a handmaid that is heir to her mistress.
There are four [things which are] little upon the earth, but they [are] wiser than the wise men:
The ants [are] a people not strong, yet they prepare their food in the summer;
the conies [are but] a feeble folk, yet they make their houses in the rocks;
the locusts have no king, yet all of them go forth by bands;
the spider takes hold with her hands and is in kings' palaces.
There are three [things] which have a magnificent walk; [yea], the fourth is stately in going:
The lion [which is] strongest among beasts and does not turn away for any;
[the greyhound] who is girded up of loins; a he goat also, and the king, against whom no one rises up.
If thou hast fallen, it is because thou hast lifted thyself up; and if thou hast thought evil, [lay] thine hand upon thy mouth.
Surely the churning of milk brings forth butter and the wringing of the nose brings forth blood; so the forcing of wrath brings forth strife.:

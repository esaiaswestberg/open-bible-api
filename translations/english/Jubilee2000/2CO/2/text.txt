But I determined this with myself, that I would not come again to you in grief.
For if I make you grieve, who is he then that shall make me glad, but the same who is grieved by me?
And I wrote this same unto you, lest when I came, I should have grief from those of whom I ought to rejoice; having confidence in you all, that my joy is [the joy] of you all.
For out of much affliction and anguish of heart I wrote unto you with many tears; not that ye should be grieved, but that ye might know how much more charity I have towards you.
But if any have caused [me] grief, he has not grieved me, but in part, that I may not put a burden on you all.
Sufficient to such a one [is] this reprehension, which [was inflicted] of many.
So that contrariwise ye [ought] rather to forgive [him] and comfort [him], lest perhaps such a one should be swallowed up with too much grief.
Therefore I beseech you that ye would confirm [your] charity toward him.
For to this end also I wrote, that I might know the proof of you, whether ye are obedient in all things.
To whom ye forgive any thing, I [forgive] also; for if I forgave any thing, to whom I forgave [it], for your sakes [I forgave it] in the person of Christ,
lest Satan should deceive us, for we do not ignore his devices.
Having come to Troas for the gospel of the Christ, even though [a] door was opened unto me in the Lord,
I had no rest in my spirit because I did not find Titus my brother, but taking my leave of them, I went from there into Macedonia.
Now thanks [be] unto God, who always causes us to triumph in the Christ and makes manifest the savour of his knowledge by us in every place.
For we are unto God a sweet savour of Christ, in those that are saved and in those that perish;
to the one [we are] the savour of death unto death and to the other the savour of life unto life. And who [is] sufficient for these things?
For we are not as many, false merchandisers of the word of God, but as of sincerity, but as of God, in the sight of God we speak in Christ.:

And the LORD called unto Moses, and spoke unto him out of the tabernacle of the testimony, saying,
Speak unto the sons of Israel and say unto them, When any of you offers an offering unto the LORD of animals, of cattle, [even] of the cows, or of the sheep ye shall make your offering.
If his offering is a burnt sacrifice of the herd, let him offer a male without blemish; he shall offer it of his own free will at the door of the tabernacle of the testimony before the LORD.
And he shall put his hand upon the head of the burnt offering, and he shall accept it to reconcile him.
Then he shall kill the bullock before the LORD; and the priests, Aaron's sons, shall offer the blood and sprinkle the blood round about upon the altar that is [by] the door of the tabernacle of the testimony.
And he shall flay the burnt offering and cut it into its pieces.
And the sons of Aaron, the priest, shall put fire upon the altar and lay the wood in order upon the fire.
Then the priests, Aaron's sons, shall lay the parts, the head and the fat, in order upon the wood that is on the fire which [shall be] upon the altar;
but he shall wash its intestines and its legs in water, and the priest shall incense it all on the altar, [to be] a burnt sacrifice, an offering on fire, of a very acceptable aroma unto the LORD.
And if his offering is of the sheep, [namely] of the lambs or of the goats, for a burnt sacrifice, he shall offer a male without blemish.
And he must kill it on the side of the altar, to the Aquilon before the LORD; and the priests, Aaron's sons, shall sprinkle its blood round about upon the altar.
And he shall cut it into its pieces, with its head and its fat; and the priest shall lay them in order on the wood that is on the fire which [shall be] upon the altar;
and he shall wash the inwards and the legs with water; and the priest shall offer [it] all and incense [it] upon the altar; it [is] a burnt sacrifice, an offering on fire, of a very acceptable aroma unto the LORD.
And if the burnt sacrifice for his offering to the LORD [is to be] of fowls, then he shall bring his offering of turtledoves or of young pigeons.
And the priest shall offer it upon the altar and wring off its head and incense [it] on the altar; and its blood shall be wrung out upon the side of the altar:
And he shall pluck away its crop and its feathers and cast them beside the altar on the east part, by the place of the ashes [with the burnt] fat.
And he shall cleave it by its wings [but] shall not divide [it] in two; and the priest shall incense it upon the altar, upon the wood that [is] upon the fire; it [is] a burnt sacrifice, an offering on fire of a very acceptable aroma unto the LORD.:

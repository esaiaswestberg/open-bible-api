Praise ye the Lord. Blessed is the man, that feareth the Lord, and deliteth greatly in his commandements.
His seede shall be mightie vpon earth: the generation of the righteous shall be blessed.
Riches and treasures shalbe in his house, and his righteousnesse endureth for euer.
Vnto the righteous ariseth light in darkenes: he is merciful and full of copassion and righteous.
A good man is mercifull and lendeth, and will measure his affaires by iudgement.
Surely he shall neuer be moued: but the righteous shalbe had in euerlasting remembrance.
He will not be afraide of euill tidings: for his heart is fixed, and beleeueth in the Lord.
His heart is stablished: therefore he will not feare, vntill he see his desire vpon his enemies.
He hath distributed and giuen to ye poore: his righteousnesse remaineth for euer: his horne shalbe exalted with glory.
The wicked shall see it and be angrie: he shall gnash with his teeth, and consume away: the desire of the wicked shall perish.

A Psalme. Sing vnto the Lord a newe song: for hee hath done marueilous things: his right hand, and his holy arme haue gotten him the victorie.
The Lord declared his saluation: his righteousnes hath he reueiled in the sight of ye nations.
He hath remembred his mercy and his trueth toward the house of Israel: all the ends of the earth haue seene the saluation of our God.
All the earth, sing ye loude vnto the Lord: crie out and reioyce, and sing prayses.
Sing prayse to the Lord vpon the harpe, euen vpon the harpe with a singing voyce.
With shalmes and sound of trumpets sing loude before the Lord the King.
Let the sea roare, and all that therein is, the world, and they that dwell therein.
Let the floods clap their hands, and let the mountaines reioyce together
Before the Lord: for he is come to iudge the earth: with righteousnesse shall hee iudge the world, and the people with equitie.

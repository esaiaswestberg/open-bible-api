To him that excelleth on Neginoth upon the eith tune. A Psalme of Dauid. O lord, rebuke me not in thine anger, neither chastise me in thy wrath.
Haue mercie vpon me, O Lord, for I am weake: O Lord heale me, for my bones are vexed.
My soule is also sore troubled: but Lord how long wilt thou delay?
Returne, O Lord: deliuer my soule: saue me for thy mercies sake.
For in death there is no remembrance of thee: in the graue who shall prayse thee?
I fainted in my mourning: I cause my bed euery night to swimme, and water my couch with my teares.
Mine eye is dimmed for despight, and sunke in because of all mine enemies.
Away from mee all ye workers of iniquitie: for the Lord hath heard the voyce of my weeping.
The Lord hath heard my petition: the Lord will receiue my prayer.
All mine enemies shall be confounded and sore vexed: they shall be turned backe, and put to shame suddenly.

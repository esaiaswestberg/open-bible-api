To him that excelleth on Neginoth. A Psalme of David, to give instruction. When the Ziphims came and said unto Saul, Is not David hid among us? Save mee, O God, by thy Name, and by thy power iudge me.
O God, heare my prayer: hearken vnto the wordes of my mouth.
For strangers are risen vp against me, and tyrants seeke my soule: they haue not set God before them. Selah.
Beholde, God is mine helper: the Lord is with them that vpholde my soule.
He shall rewarde euill vnto mine enemies: Oh cut them off in thy trueth!
Then I will sacrifice freely vnto thee: I wil praise thy Name, O Lord, because it is good.
For he hath deliuered me out of al trouble, and mine eye hath seene my desire vpon mine enemies.

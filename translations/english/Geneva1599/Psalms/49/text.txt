To him that excelleth. A Psalme committed to the sonnes of Korah. Heare this, all ye people: giue eare, all ye that dwell in the world,
As well lowe as hie, both rich and poore.
My mouth shall speake of wisdome, and the meditation of mine heart is of knowledge.
I will incline mine eare to a parable, and vtter my graue matter vpon the harpe.
Wherefore should I feare in the euil dayes, when iniquitie shall compasse me about, as at mine heeles?
They trust in their goods, and boast them selues in the multitude of their riches.
Yet a man can by no meanes redeeme his brother: he can not giue his raunsome to God,
(So precious is the redemption of their soules, and the continuance for euer)
That he may liue still for euer, and not see the graue.
For he seeth that wise men die, and also that the ignorant and foolish perish, and leaue their riches for others.
Yet they thinke, their houses, and their habitations shall continue for euer, euen from generation to generation, and call their lands by their names.
But man shall not continue in honour: he is like the beastes that die.
This their way vttereth their foolishnes: yet their posteritie delite in their talke. Selah.
Like sheepe they lie in graue: death deuoureth them, and the righteous shall haue domination ouer them in the morning: for their beautie shall consume, when they shall goe from their house to graue.
But God shall deliuer my soule from the power of the graue: for he will receiue me. Selah.
Be not thou afrayd when one is made rich, and when the glory of his house is increased.
For he shall take nothing away when he dieth, neither shall his pompe descende after him.
For while he liued, he reioyced himselfe: and men will prayse thee, when thou makest much of thy selfe.
He shall enter into the generation of his fathers, and they shall not liue for euer.
Man is in honour, and vnderstandeth not: he is like to beasts that perish.

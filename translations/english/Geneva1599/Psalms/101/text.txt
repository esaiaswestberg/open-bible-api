A Psalme of David. I will sing mercie and iudgement: vnto thee, O Lord, will I sing.
I will doe wisely in the perfite way, till thou commest to me: I will walke in the vprightnes of mine heart in the middes of mine house.
I wil set no wicked thing before mine eyes: I hate the worke of them that fall away: it shall not cleaue vnto me.
A froward heart shall depart from me: I will knowe none euill.
Him that priuily slandereth his neighbour, wil I destroy: him that hath a proude looke and hie heart, I cannot suffer.
Mine eyes shalbe vnto the faithfull of the lande, that they may dwell with me: he that walketh in a perfite way, he shall serue me.
There shall no deceitful person dwell within mine house: he that telleth lyes, shall not remaine in my sight.
Betimes will I destroy all the wicked of the land, that I may cut off all the workers of iniquitie from the Citie of the Lord.

Praise ye the Lord. Praise ye the Lord from the heauen: prayse ye him in the high places.
Prayse ye him, all ye his Angels: praise him, all his armie.
Prayse ye him, sunne and moone: prayse ye him all bright starres.
Prayse ye him, heauens of heauens, and waters, that be aboue the heauens.
Let them prayse the Name of the Lord: for he commanded, and they were created.
And he hath established them for euer and euer: he hath made an ordinance, which shall not passe.
Prayse ye the Lord from the earth, ye dragons and all depths:
Fire and hayle, snowe and vapours, stormie winde, which execute his worde:
Mountaines and all hils, fruitfull trees and all ceders:
Beasts and all cattell, creeping things and fethered foules:
Kings of the earth and all people, princes and all iudges of the worlde:
Yong men and maidens, also olde men and children:
Let them prayse the Name of the Lord: for his Name onely is to be exalted, and his prayse aboue the earth and the heauens.
For he hath exalted the horne of his people, which is a prayse for all his Saintes, euen for the children of Israel, a people that is neere vnto him. Prayse ye the Lord.

A Psalme of Dauid, when he fled from his sonne Absalom. Lord, howe are mine aduersaries increased? howe many rise against me?
Many say to my soule, There is no helpe for him in God. Selah.
But thou Lord art a buckler for me: my glory, and the lifter vp of mine head.
I did call vnto the Lord with my voyce, and he heard me out of his holy mountaine. Selah.
I layed me downe and slept, and rose vp againe: for the Lord susteined me.
I will not be afrayde for ten thousand of the people, that should beset me round about.
O Lord, arise: helpe me, my God: for thou hast smitten all mine enemies vpon the cheeke bone: thou hast broken the teeth of the wicked.
Saluation belongeth vnto the Lord, and thy blessing is vpon thy people. Selah.

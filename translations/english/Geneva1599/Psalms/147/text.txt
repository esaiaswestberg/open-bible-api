Praise ye the Lord, for it is good to sing vnto our God: for it is a pleasant thing, and praise is comely.
The Lord doth builde vp Ierusalem, and gather together the dispersed of Israel.
He healeth those that are broken in heart, and bindeth vp their sores.
He counteth the nomber of the starres, and calleth them all by their names.
Great is our Lord, and great is his power: his wisdome is infinite.
The Lord relieueth the meeke, and abaseth the wicked to the ground.
Sing vnto the Lord with prayse: sing vpon the harpe vnto our God,
Which couereth the heauen with cloudes, and prepareth raine for the earth, and maketh the grasse to growe vpon the mountaines:
Which giueth to beasts their foode, and to the yong rauens that crie.
He hath not pleasure in the strength of an horse, neither delighteth he in the legs of man.
But the Lord deliteth in them that feare him, and attende vpon his mercie.
Prayse the Lord, O Ierusalem: prayse thy God, O Zion.
For he hath made the barres of thy gates strong, and hath blessed thy children within thee.
He setteth peace in thy borders, and satisfieth thee with the floure of wheate.
He sendeth foorth his commandement vpon earth, and his worde runneth very swiftly.
He giueth snowe like wooll, and scattereth the hoare frost like ashes.
He casteth foorth his yce like morsels: who can abide the colde thereof?
He sendeth his worde and melteth them: he causeth his winde to blowe, and the waters flowe.
He sheweth his word vnto Iaakob, his statutes and his iudgements vnto Israel.
He hath not dealt so with euery nation, neither haue they knowen his iudgements. Prayse ye the Lord.

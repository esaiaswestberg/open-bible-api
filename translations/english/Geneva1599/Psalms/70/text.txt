To him excelleth. A Psalme of David to put in remembrance. O God, haste thee to deliuer mee: make haste to helpe me, O Lord.
Let them be confounded and put to shame, that seeke my soule: let them bee turned backewarde and put to rebuke, that desire mine hurt.
Let them be turned backe for a rewarde of their shame, which said, Aha, aha.
But let all those that seeke thee, be ioyfull and glad in thee, and let all that loue thy saluation, say alwaies, God be praised.
Nowe I am poore and needie: O God, make haste to me: thou art mine helper, and my deliuerer: O Lord, make no tarying.

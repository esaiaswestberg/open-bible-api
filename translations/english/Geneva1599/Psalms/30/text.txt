A Psalme or song of the dedication of the house of David. I will magnifie thee, O Lord: for thou hast exalted mee, and hast not made my foe to reioyce ouer me.
O Lord my God, I cried vnto thee, and thou hast restored me.
O Lord, thou hast brought vp my soule out of the graue: thou hast reuiued me from them that goe downe into the pit.
Sing praises vnto the Lord, ye his Saintes, and giue thankes before the remembrance of his Holinesse.
For he endureth but a while in his anger: but in his fauour is life: weeping may abide at euening, but ioy commeth in the morning.
And in my prosperitie I sayde, I shall neuer be moued.
For thou Lord of thy goodnes hadest made my mountaine to stande strong: but thou didest hide thy face, and I was troubled.
Then cried I vnto thee, O Lord, and praied to my Lord.
What profite is there in my blood, when I go downe to the pit? shall the dust giue thankes vnto thee? or shall it declare thy trueth?
Heare, O Lord, and haue mercy vpon me: Lord, be thou mine helper.
Thou hast turned my mourning into ioy: thou hast loosed my sacke and girded mee with gladnesse.
Therefore shall my tongue praise thee and not cease: O Lord my God, I will giue thankes vnto thee for euer.

A song of degrees. Out of the deepe places haue I called vnto thee, O Lord.
Lord, heare my voyce: let thine eares attend to the voyce of my prayers.
If thou, O Lord, straightly markest iniquities, O Lord, who shall stand?
But mercie is with thee, that thou mayest be feared.
I haue waited on the Lord: my soule hath waited, and I haue trusted in his worde.
My soule waiteth on the Lord more then the morning watch watcheth for the morning.
Let Israel waite on the Lord: for with the Lord is mercie, and with him is great redemption.
And he shall redeeme Israel from all his iniquities.

A Psalme of David. Give vnto the Lord, ye sonnes of the mightie: giue vnto the Lord glorie and strength.
Giue vnto the Lord glorie due vnto his Name: worship the Lord in the glorious Sanctuarie.
The voyce of the Lord is vpon the waters: the God of glorie maketh it to thunder: the Lord is vpon the great waters.
The voyce of the Lord is mightie: the voyce of the Lord is glorious.
The voyce of the Lord breaketh the cedars: yea, the Lord breaketh the cedars of Lebanon.
He maketh them also to leape like a calfe: Lebanon also and Shirion like a yong vnicorne.
The voice of the Lord deuideth the flames of sire.
The voice of the Lord maketh the wildernes to tremble: the Lord maketh the wildernes of Kadesh to tremble.
The voice of the Lord maketh the hindes to calue, and discouereth the forests: therefore in his Temple doth euery man speake of his glory.
The Lord sitteth vpon the flood, and the Lord doeth remaine King for euer.
The Lord shall giue strength vnto his people: the Lord shall blesse his people with peace.

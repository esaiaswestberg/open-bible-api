A Psalme of Dauid, when he changed his behauiour before Abimelech, who droue him away, and he departed. I will alway giue thankes vnto the Lord: his praise shalbe in my mouth continually.
My soule shall glory in the Lord: the humble shall heare it, and be glad.
Praise ye the Lord with me, and let vs magnifie his Name together.
I sought the Lord, and he heard me: yea, he deliuered me out of all my feare.
They shall looke vnto him, and runne to him: and their faces shall not be ashamed, saying,
This poore man cryed, and the Lord heard him, and saued him out of all his troubles.
The Angel of the Lord pitcheth round about them, that feare him, and deliuereth them.
Taste ye and see, howe gratious the Lord is: blessed is the man that trusteth in him.
Feare the Lord, ye his Saintes: for nothing wanteth to them that feare him.
The lyons doe lacke and suffer hunger, but they, which seeke the Lord, shall want nothing that is good.
Come children, hearken vnto me: I will teache you the feare of the Lord.
What man is he, that desireth life, and loueth long dayes for to see good?
Keepe thy tongue from euill, and thy lips, that they speake no guile.
Eschewe euill and doe good: seeke peace and follow after it.
The eyes of the Lord are vpon the righteous, and his eares are open vnto their crie.
But the face of the Lord is against them that doe euill, to cut off their remembrance from the earth.
The righteous crie, and the Lord heareth them, and deliuereth them out of all their troubles.
The Lord is neere vnto them that are of a contrite heart, and will saue such as be afflicted in Spirite.
Great are the troubles of the righteous: but the Lord deliuereth him out of them all.
He keepeth all his bones: not one of them is broken.
But malice shall slay the wicked: and they that hate the righteous, shall perish.
The Lord redeemeth the soules of his seruants: and none, that trust in him, shall perish.

A Psalme or song committed to the sonnes of Korah. God layde his foundations among the holy mountaines.
The Lord loueth the gates of Zion aboue all the habitations of Iaakob.
Glorious things are spoken of thee, O citie of God. Selah.
I will make mention of Rahab and Babel among them that knowe me: beholde Palestina and Tyrus with Ethiopia, There is he borne.
And of Zion it shall be sayde, Many are borne in her: and he, euen the most High shall stablish her.
The Lord shall count, when hee writeth the people, He was borne there. Selah.
Aswell the singers as the players on instruments shall prayse thee: all my springs are in thee.

Yet they were profounde, to decline to slaughter, though I haue bene a rebuker of them all.

They will not giue their mindes to turne vnto their God: for the spirit of fornication is in the middes of them, and they haue not knowen the Lord.
And the pride of Israel doth testifie to his face: therefore shall Israel and Ephraim fall in their iniquitie: Iudah also shall fall with them.
They shall goe with their sheepe, and with their bullockes to seeke the Lord: but they shall not finde him: for he hath withdrawne himselfe from them.

Ephraim shall be desolate in the day of rebuke: among the tribes of Israel haue I caused to knowe the trueth.
The princes of Iudah were like them that remoue the bounde: therefore will I powre out my wrath vpon them like water.
Ephraim is oppressed, and broken in iudgement, because he willingly walked after the commandement.

When Ephraim sawe his sickenes, and Iudah his wound, then went Ephraim vnto Asshur, and sent vnto King Iareb: yet coulde hee not heale you, nor cure you of your wound.
For I will be vnto Ephraim as a lyon, and as a lyons whelpe to the house of Iudah: I, euen I will spoyle, and goe away: I will take away, and none shall rescue it.
I will go, and returne to my place, til they acknowledge their fault, and seeke me: in their affliction they will seeke me diligently.

Wherefore since we could no longer forbare, wee thought it good to remaine at Athens alone,
And haue sent Timotheus our brother and minister of God, and our labour felow in the Gospel of Christ, to stablish you, and to comfort you touching your faith,
That no man should be moued with these afflictions: for ye your selues knowe, that we are appointed thereunto.
For verily when we were with you, we told you before that we should suffer tribulations, euen as it came to passe, and ye knowe it.
Euen for this cause, when I could no longer forbeare, I sent him that I might knowe of your faith, lest the tempter had tempted you in any sort, and that our labour had bene in vaine.
But now lately when Timotheus came from you vnto vs, and brought vs good tidings of your faith and loue, and that ye haue good remembrance of vs alwayes, desiring to see vs, as we also do you,
Therefore, brethren, we had consolation in you, in all our affliction and necessitie through your faith.
For nowe are wee aliue, if ye stand fast in the Lord.
For what thankes can wee recompense to God againe for you, for all the ioy wherewith we reioyce for your sakes before our God,
Night and day, praying exceedingly that wee might see your face, and might accomplish that which is lacking in your faith?
Nowe God himselfe, euen our Father, and our Lord Iesus Christ, guide our iourney vnto you,
And the Lord increase you, and make you abound in loue one toward another, and towarde all men, euen as we doe toward you:
To make your hearts stable and vnblameable in holines before God euen our Father, at the comming of our Lord Iesus Christ with all his Saints.

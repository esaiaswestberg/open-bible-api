And they watched him, whether he would heale him on the Sabbath day, that they might accuse him.
Then he saide vnto the man which had the withered hand, Arise: stand forth in the middes.
And he saide to them, Is it lawfull to doe a good deede on the Sabbath day, or to doe euil? to saue the life, or to kill? But they held their peace.
Then hee looked rounde about on them angerly, mourning also for the hardnesse of their hearts, and saide to the man, Stretch foorth thine hand. And he stretched it out: and his hande was restored, as whole as the other.

And from Ierusalem, and from Idumea, and beyonde Iordan: and they that dwelled about Tyrus and Sidon, when they had heard what great things he did, came vnto him in great number.
And he commanded his disciples, that a litle shippe should waite for him, because of the multitude, lest they shoulde throng him.
For hee had healed many, in so much that they preassed vpon him to touch him, as many as had plagues.

And Andrew, and Philippe, and Bartlemew, and Matthewe, and Thomas, and Iames, the sonne of Alpheus, and Thaddeus, and Simon the Cananite,
And Iudas Iscariot, who also betraied him, and they came home.

But he called them vnto him, and said vnto them in parables, How can Satan driue out Satan?
For if a kingdome bee deuided against it selfe, that kingdome can not stand.

Then came his brethren and mother, and stoode without, and sent vnto him, and called him.

But hee answered them, saying, Who is my mother and my brethren?
And hee looked rounde about on them, which sate in compasse about him, and saide, Beholde my mother and my brethren.
For whosoeuer doeth the will of God, he is my brother, and my sister, and mother.

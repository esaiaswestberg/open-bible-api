I am the rose of the fielde, and the lilie of the valleys.
Like a lilie amog the thornes, so is my loue among the daughters.
Like the apple tree among the trees of the forest, so is my welbeloued among the sonnes of men: vnder his shadow had I delite, and sate downe: and his fruite was sweete vnto my mouth.
Hee brought mee into the wine cellar, and loue was his banner ouer me.
Stay me with flagons, and comfort me with apples: for I am sicke of loue.
His left hande is vnder mine head, and his right hand doeth imbrace me.
I charge you, O daughters of Ierusalem, by the roes and by the hindes of the fielde, that ye stirre not vp, nor waken my loue, vntill she please.
It is the voyce of my welbeloued: beholde, hee commeth leaping by the mountaines, and skipping by the hilles.
My welbeloued is like a roe, or a yong hart: loe, he standeth behinde our wall, looking forth of the windowes, shewing him selfe through the grates.
My welbeloued spake and said vnto me, Arise, my loue, my faire one, and come thy way.
For beholde, winter is past: the raine is changed, and is gone away.
The flowers appeare in the earth: the time of the singing of birdes is come, and the voyce of the turtle is heard in our land.
The figtree hath brought foorth her yong figges: and the vines with their small grapes haue cast a sauour: arise my loue, my faire one, and come away.
My doue, that art in the holes of ye rocke, in the secret places of the staires, shewe mee thy sight, let mee heare thy voyce: for thy voyce is sweete, and thy sight comely.
Take vs the foxes, the little foxes, which destroy the vines: for our vines haue small grapes.
My welbeloued is mine, and I am his: hee feedeth among the lilies,
Vntil the day breake, and the shadowes flee away: returne, my welbeloued, and be like a roe, or a yong hart vpon the mountaines of Bether.

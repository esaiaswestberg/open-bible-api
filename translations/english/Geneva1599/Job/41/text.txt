None is so fearce that dare stirre him vp. Who is he then that can stand before me?
Who hath preuented mee that I shoulde make an ende? Al vnder heauen is mine.
I will not keepe silence concerning his partes, nor his power nor his comely proportion.
Who can discouer the face of his garmet? or who shall come to him with a double bridle?
Who shall open the doores of his face? his teeth are fearefull round about.
The maiestie of his scales is like strog shields, and are sure sealed.
One is set to another, that no winde can come betweene them.
One is ioyned to another: they sticke together, that they cannot be sundered.
His niesings make the light to shine, and his eyes are like the eyelids of the morning.
Out of his mouth go lampes, and sparkes of fire leape out.
Out of his nostrels commeth out smoke, as out of a boyling pot or caldron.
His breath maketh the coales burne: for a flame goeth out of his mouth.
In his necke remayneth strength, and labour is reiected before his face.
The members of his bodie are ioyned: they are strong in themselues, and cannot be mooued.
His heart is as strong as a stone, and as hard as the nether milstone.
The mightie are afrayd of his maiestie, and for feare they faint in themselues.
When the sword doeth touch him, he will not rise vp, nor for the speare, dart nor habergeon.
He esteemeth yron as strawe, and brasse as rotten wood.
The archer canot make him flee: ye stones of the sling are turned into stubble vnto him:
The dartes are counted as strawe: and hee laugheth at the shaking of the speare.
Sharpe stones are vnder him, and he spreadeth sharpe things vpon the myre.
He maketh the depth to boyle like a pot, and maketh the sea like a pot of oyntment.
He maketh a path to shine after him: one would thinke the depth as an hoare head.
In the earth there is none like him: hee is made without feare.
He beholdeth al hie things: he is a King ouer all the children of pride.

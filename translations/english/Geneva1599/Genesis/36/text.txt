Esau tooke his wiues of the daughters of Canaan: Adah the daughter of Elon an Hittite, and Aholibamah the daughter of Anah, the daughter of Zibeon an Hiuite,

And Adah bare vnto Esau, Eliphaz: and Basemath bare Reuel.
Also Aholibamah bare Ieush, and Iaalam, and Korah: these are the sonnes of Esau which were borne to him in the land of Canaan.
So Esau tooke his wiues and his sonnes, and his daughters, and all the soules of his house, and his flocks, and all his cattell, and all his substance, which he had gotten in the land of Canaan, and went into an other countrey from his brother Iaakob.

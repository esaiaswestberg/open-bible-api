The Lord spake againe vnto Moses in the wildernesse of Sinai, in the Tabernacle of the Congregation, in the first day of the second moneth, in the second yere after they were come out of the land of Egypt, saying,

From twentie yere olde and aboue, all that go forth to the warre in Israel, thou and Aaron shall number them, throughout their armies.
And with you shalbe men of euery tribe, such as are the heads of the house of their fathers.
And these are the names of the men that shall stand with you, of the tribe of Reuben, Elizur, the sonne of Shedeur:

These are the summes which Moses, and Aaron nombred, and the Princes of Israel, the twelue men, which were euery one for the house of their fathers.
So this was all the summe of the sonnes of Israel, by the houses of their fathers, from twenty yeere olde and aboue, all that went to the warre in Israel,
And all they were in nomber sixe hudreth and three thousande, fiue hundreth and fiftie.
But the Leuites, after the tribes of their fathers were not nombred among them.
For the Lord had spoken vnto Moses, and said,
Onely thou shalt not number the tribe of Leui, neither take the summe of them among the children of Israel:
But thou shalt appoynt the Leuites ouer the Tabernacle of the Testimonie, and ouer all the instruments thereof, and ouer all things that belong to it: they shall beare the Tabernacle, and all the instruments thereof, and shall minister in it, and shall dwell round about the Tabernacle.
And when the Tabernacle goeth forth, the Leuites shall take it downe: and when the Tabernacle is to be pitched, ye Leuites shall set it vp: for the stranger that commeth neere, shalbe slaine.
Also the children of Israel shall pitch their tentes, euery man in his campe, and euery man vnder his standerd throughout their armies.
But the Leuites shall pitch rounde about the Tabernacle of the Testimonie, least vengeance come vpon the Congregation of the children of Israel, and the Leuites shall take the charge of the Tabernacle of the Testimonie.
So the children of Israel did according to all that ye Lord had comanded Moses: so did they.

A song of degrees. I called vnto the Lord in my trouble, and hee heard me.
Deliuer my soule, O Lord, from lying lippes, and from a deceitfull tongue.
What doeth thy deceitfull tongue bring vnto thee? or what doeth it auaile thee?
It is as the sharpe arrowes of a mightie man, and as the coales of iuniper.
Woe is to me that I remaine in Meschech, and dwell in the tentes of Kedar.
My soule hath too long dwelt with him that hateth peace.
I seeke peace, and when I speake thereof, they are bent to warre.

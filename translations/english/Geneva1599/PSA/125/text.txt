A song of degrees. They that trust in the Lord, shalbe as mount Zion, which can not be remooued, but remaineth for euer.
As the mountaines are about Ierusalem: so is the Lord about his people from henceforth and for euer.
For the rod of the wicked shall not rest on the lot of the righteous, least the righteous put forth their hand vnto wickednes.
Doe well, O Lord, vnto those that be good and true in their hearts.
But these that turne aside by their crooked wayes, them shall the Lord leade with the workers of iniquitie: but peace shalbe vpon Israel.

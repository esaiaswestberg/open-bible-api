To him that excelleth upon Alamoth a song committed to the sonnes of Korah. God is our hope and strength, and helpe in troubles, ready to be found.
Therefore will not we feare, though the earth be moued, and though the mountaines fall into the middes of the sea.
Though the waters thereof rage and be troubled, and the mountaines shake at the surges of the same. Selah,
Yet there is a Riuer, whose streames shall make glad the citie of God: euen the Sanctuarie of the Tabernacles of the most High.
God is in the middes of it: therefore shall it not be moued: God shall helpe it very earely.
When the nations raged, and the kingdomes were moued, God thundred, and the earth melted.
The Lord of hostes is with vs: the God of Iaakob is our refuge. Selah.
Come, and behold the workes of the Lord, what desolations he hath made in the earth.
He maketh warres to cease vnto the endes of the world: he breaketh the bowe and cutteth the speare, and burneth the chariots with fire.
Be still and knowe that I am God: I will be exalted among the heathen, and I wil be exalted in the earth.
The Lord of hostes is with vs: the God of Iaakob is our refuge. Selah.

To him that excelleth. A Psalme of David on Michtam, concerning the dumme doue in a farre countrey, when the Philistims tooke him in Gath. Be mercifull vnto me, O God, for man would swallow me vp: he fighteth continually and vexeth me.
Mine enemies would dayly swallowe mee vp: for many fight against me, O thou most High.
When I was afrayd, I trusted in thee.
I will reioyce in God, because of his word, I trust in God, and will not feare what flesh can doe vnto me.
Mine owne wordes grieue me dayly: all their thoughtes are against me to doe me hurt.
They gather together, and keepe them selues close: they marke my steps, because they waite for my soule.
They thinke they shall escape by iniquitie: O God, cast these people downe in thine anger.
Thou hast counted my wandrings: put my teares into thy bottel: are they not in thy register?
When I cry, then mine enemies shall turne backe: this I know, for God is with me.
I will reioyce in God because of his worde: in the Lord wil I reioyce because of his worde.
In God doe I trust: I will not be afrayd what man can doe vnto me.
Thy vowes are vpon me, O God: I will render prayses vnto thee.
For thou hast deliuered my soule from death, and also my feete from falling, that I may walke before God in the light of the liuing.

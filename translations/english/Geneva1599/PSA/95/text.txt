Come, let vs reioyce vnto the Lord: let vs sing aloude vnto the rocke of our saluation.
Let vs come before his face with praise: let vs sing loude vnto him with Psalmes.
For the Lord is a great God, and a great King aboue all gods.
In whose hande are the deepe places of the earth, and the heightes of the mountaines are his:
To whome the Sea belongeth: for hee made it, and his handes formed the dry land.
Come, let vs worship and fall downe, and kneele before the Lord our maker.
For he is our God, and we are the people of his pasture, and the sheepe of his hande: to day, if ye will heare his voyce,
Harden not your heart, as in Meribah, and as in the day of Massah in the wildernesse.
Where your fathers tempted me, proued me, though they had seene my worke.
Fourtie yeeres haue I contended with this generation, and said, They are a people that erre in heart, for they haue not knowen my wayes.
Wherefore I sware in my wrath, saying, Surely they shall not enter into my rest.

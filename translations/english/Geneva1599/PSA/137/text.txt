By the riuers of Babel we sate, and there wee wept, when we remembred Zion.
Wee hanged our harpes vpon the willowes in the middes thereof.
Then they that ledde vs captiues, required of vs songs and mirth, when wee had hanged vp our harpes, saying, Sing vs one of the songs of Zion.
Howe shall we sing, said we, a song of the Lord in a strange land?
If I forget thee, O Ierusalem, let my right hand forget to play.
If I do not remember thee, let my tongue cleaue to the roofe of my mouth: yea, if I preferre not Ierusalem to my chiefe ioy.
Remember the children of Edom, O Lord, in the day of Ierusalem, which saide, Rase it, rase it to the foundation thereof.
O daughter of Babel, worthy to be destroyed, blessed shall he be that rewardeth thee, as thou hast serued vs.
Blessed shall he be that taketh and dasheth thy children against the stones.

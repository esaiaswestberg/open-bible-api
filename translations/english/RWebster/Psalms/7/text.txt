O LORD my God, in thee do I put my trust: save me from all them that persecute me, and deliver me:
Lest he tear my soul like a lion, rending it in pieces, while there is none to deliver.
O LORD my God, if I have done this; if there is iniquity in my hands;
If I have rewarded evil to him that was at peace with me; (yea, I have delivered him that without cause is my enemy:)
Let the enemy persecute my soul, and take it ; yea, let him tread down my life upon the earth, and lay my honour in the dust. Selah.
Arise, O LORD, in thy anger, lift up thyself because of the rage of my enemies: and awake for me to the judgment that thou hast commanded.
So shall the congregation of the people surround thee: for their sakes therefore return thou on high.
The LORD shall judge the people: judge me, O LORD, according to my righteousness, and according to my integrity that is in me.
O let the wickedness of the wicked come to an end; but establish the just: for the righteous God trieth the hearts and reins.
My defenceis from God, who saveth the upright in heart.
God judgeth the righteous, and God is angry with the wicked every day.
If he turn not, he will whet his sword; he hath bent his bow, and made it ready.
He hath also prepared for him the instruments of death; he ordaineth his arrows against the persecutors.
Behold, he travaileth with iniquity, and hath conceived mischief, and brought forth falsehood.
He made a pit, and dug it, and hath fallen into the ditch which he made.
His mischief shall return upon his own head, and his violent dealing shall come down upon the crown of his head.
I will praise the LORD according to his righteousness: and will sing praise to the name of the LORD most high.

And David consulted the chiefs of the thousands and of the hundreds, to every leader.
And David said to all the assembly of Israel, If it is good to you, and it has broken forth from Jehovah our God, we shall send to our brothers those remaining in all the lands of Israel, and with them the priests and the Levites in the cities of their open lands; and they shall be gathered to us.
And we shall bring around to us the ark of our God, for we did not seek Him in the days of Saul.
And all the congregation said to do so, for the thing was right in the eyes of all the people.
And David gathered all Israel, from Shihor of Egypt even to the entering in of Hamath, to bring in the ark of God from Kirjath-jearim.
And David and all Israel went up to Baalah, to Kirjath-jearim of Judah, to bring up from there the ark of Jehovah God, who dwells among the cherubs, where the Name was called on.
And they made the ark of God to ride on a new cart from the house of Abinadab. And Uzza and Ahio were leading the cart.
And David and all Israel were playing before God with all their might, and with songs, and with lyres, and with harps, and with timbrels, and with cymbals, and with trumpets.
And when they came to the threshing-floor of Chidon, then Uzza put out his hand to hold the ark, for the oxen stumbled.
And the anger of Jehovah burned against Uzza, and He struck him, because he had put out his hand on the ark:; and he died there before God.
And it burned to David, for Jehovah had broken a breach against Uzza; and he called that place, The Breach of Uzza to this day.
And David feared God on that day, saying, How shall I bring the ark of God to me?
And David did not bring the ark to himself, to the City of David, but carried it aside to the house of Obed-edom the Gittite.
And the ark of God remained with the household of Obed-edom in his house three months. And Jehovah blessed the house of Obed-edom and all that he had.

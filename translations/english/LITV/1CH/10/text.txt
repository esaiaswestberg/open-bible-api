And the Philistines fought with Israel. And the men of Israel fled from the face of the Philistines, and fell wounded in Mount Gilboa.
And the Philistines pursued Saul and his sons; and the Philistines struck Jonathan, and Abinadab, and Malchishua, the sons of Saul.
And the battle was heavy on Saul, and the archers found him with the bow; and he was wounded by the archers.
And Saul said to his armor-bearer, Draw your sword and pierce me with it, that these uncircumcised ones not come and abuse me. And the armor-bearer was not willing, for he exceedingly feared. And Saul took the sword and fell on it.
And the armor-bearer saw that Saul was dead, and he also fell on the sword and died.
And Saul and his three sons died, and all his house; they died together.
And all the men of Israel in the valley saw that they had fled, and that Saul and his sons had died. And they forsook their cities and ran away. And the Philistines came and lived in them.
And it happened on the next day, the Philistines came to strip those pierced. And they found Saul and his sons fallen in Mount Gilboa.
And they stripped him, and carried his head and his weapons, and sent into the land of the Philistines all around to proclaim the news to their idols and the people.
And they put his weapons in the house of their gods; and they fastened his skull in the house of Dagon.
And all Jabesh-gilead heard of all that the Philistines had done to Saul.
And all the valiant men arose and carried away Saul's body, and the bodies of his sons, and brought them to Jabesh. And they buried their bones under the oak in Jabesh; and fasted seven days.
And Saul died because of his trespass that he trespassed against Jehovah, against the word of Jehovah that he did not keep, and also for asking of a medium, to inquire;
and did not inquire of Jehovah. Then He killed him, and turned the kingdom to David the son of Jesse.

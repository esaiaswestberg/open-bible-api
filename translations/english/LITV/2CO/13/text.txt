I am coming to you this third time . "In the mouth of two or three witnesses every matter shall be established." Deut. 19:15
I said before, and I say beforehand, as being present the second time and being absent now. I write to those previously sinning, and all the rest, that if I come again I will not spare;
since you seek a proof of Christ speaking in me, who is not weak toward you, but is powerful in you,
(for even if He was crucified out of weakness, yet He lives by the power of God). For even we are weak in Him, yet we shall live by the power of God toward you.
Examine yourselves, whether you are in the faith, prove yourselves. Or do you not yourselves perceive that Jesus Christ is in you, unless you are reprobates?
And I hope you will know that we are not reprobates.
But I pray to God for you not to do evil, none. It is not that we may appear approved, but that you may do the good, and we deemed to be reprobates.
For we cannot have any power against the truth, but for the truth.
For we rejoice when we are weak and you are powerful. But we pray for this also, your perfection.
Because of this, I write these things while absent, that being present I may not deal sharply with you according to the authority which the Lord gave me for building up and not for pulling down.
For the rest, brothers, rejoice! Perfect yourselves; encourage yourselves, mind the same thing, be at peace; and the God of love and of peace will be with you.
Greet one another with a holy kiss.
All the saints greet you.
The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all. Amen.

O Jehovah, God of vengeance; O God of vengeance, shine forth!
Lift up Yourself, O judge of the earth; give a just repayment on the proud.
Until when shall the wicked, O Jehovah, until when shall the wicked exult?
They gush, they speak impudent things; all the workers of evil speak proudly.
O Jehovah, they crush Your people and afflict Your inheritance.
They kill the widow and the stranger, and murder the orphan.
Yet they say, The Lord shall not see, nor shall the God of Jacob observe.
Understand you beastly ones among the people; yea, you fools, when will you be wise?
He who planted the ear, shall He not hear? He who formed the eye, shall He not see?
He who chastises the nations, shall He not punish, He who teaches man knowledge?
Jehovah knows the thoughts of man, that they are vain.
Blessed is the man You chasten, O Jehovah, You teach him out of Your law;
to give him rest from troubled days, until the pit is dug for the wicked.
For Jehovah will not leave His people; nor will He forsake His inheritance.
For judgment shall turn to righteousness; and all the upright in heart shall follow after it.
Who will rise up for Me against the evildoers? Who will stand up for Me against the workers of evil?
Unless Jehovah had been my help, my soul would almost have dwelt in silence.
If I said, My foot slides, O Jehovah, Your mercy has held me up.
In the multitude of my inward thoughts, Your comforts delight my soul.
Shall the throne of iniquity have fellowship with You, devising mischief for a statute?
They gather themselves together against the soul of the righteous, and condemn the blood of the innocent.
But Jehovah is my tower of defense; and my God is the rock of my refuge.
And He shall turn their own iniquity upon them; and He shall cut them off in their evil, Jehovah our God shall cut them off!

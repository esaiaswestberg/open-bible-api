A Psalm of Praise, of David. I will exalt you, my God, O King; and bless Your name forever and ever.
I will bless You every day; and I will praise Your name forever and ever.
Jehovah is great and to be greatly praised; and to His greatness there is no finding out.
Generation to generation shall praise Your works; and shall declare Your mighty acts.
I will muse on the glorious honor of Your majesty, and the things of Your wonderful works.
And they shall speak of the might of Your awesome works, and I will declare Your greatness.
They shall express the memory of Your great goodness, and they shall sing of Your righteousness.
Jehovah is gracious and merciful, long to anger and of great mercy;
Jehovah is good to all; and His tender mercies are over all His works.
All Your works shall thank You, O Jehovah; and Your saints shall bless You.
They shall speak of the glory of Your kingdom, and talk of Your might;
to make Your might known to the sons of men; yea, the glorious majesty of His kingdom.
Your kingdom is a kingdom to all eternities; and Your rule in all, generation and generation.
Jehovah upholds all who fall, and raises up all who are bowed down.
The eyes of all hope to You; and You give them their food in due time.
You open Your hand and satisfy the desire of every living thing.
Jehovah is righteous in all His ways, and kind in all His works.
Jehovah is near to all who call on Him, to all those who call on Him in truth.
He will fulfill the desire of the ones who fear Him; and He will hear their cry and save them.
Jehovah watches over all who love Him; but He destroys all the wicked.
My mouth shall speak the praise of Jehovah; and all flesh shall bless His holy name forever and ever.

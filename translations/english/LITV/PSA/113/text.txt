Praise Jehovah! Praise, O servants of Jehovah; praise the name of Jehovah.
Blessed is the name of Jehovah from now on and forevermore.
From the rising of the sun to its going, Jehovah's name is to be praised.
Jehovah is high above all nations; His glory above the heavens.
Who is like Jehovah our God, who sits on high to dwell;
Who humbles Himself to consider all in the earth and the heavens!
He raises up the poor from the dust; He lifts the needy out of the dunghill;
in order to make him sit with nobles, with the nobles of his people.
He causes the barren to live in the house as the joyful mother of sons. Praise Jehovah!

A Song of Ascents, of David. Except that it was Jehovah who was for us, O may Israel say;
except that it was Jehovah who was for us when men rose up against us,
then they would have swallowed us alive, when their anger glowed against us.
Then the waters would have flowed over us; the torrent would have covered our soul;
then the raging waters would have passed over our soul.
Blessed be Jehovah, who did not give us as a prey to their teeth.
Our soul has escaped like a bird out of the fowlers' snare; the snare is broken, and we have escaped.
Our help is in the name of Jehovah, the Maker of the heavens and earth.

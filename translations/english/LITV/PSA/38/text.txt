A Psalm of David, to bring to remembrance. O Jehovah, do not rebuke me in Your wrath, and do not chasten me in Your fury.
For Your arrows sink in me, and Your hand presses heavily on me.
There is no soundness in my flesh because of Your anger; nor peace in my bones because of my sin.
For my iniquities have passed over my head, as a heavy burden too heavy for me.
My wounds have putrefied and rotted, because of my foolishness.
I am bent down, I am bowed down exceedingly; I went mourning all the day long.
For my loins are filled with a burning, and there is no soundness in my flesh.
I am exceedingly benumbed and crushed. I howl from the groanings of my heart.
My Lord, all my desire is before You, and my sighing is not hidden from You.
My heart throbs; my power forsakes me! And the light of my eyes, they also are not with me.
My lovers and my friends stand apart from my stroke, and my neighbors have stood far off.
And those seeking my life lay a snare; yea, those seeking my evil speak ruin, and they utter deceits all the day long.
But like a deaf one I do not hear; and I am like a dumb one who does not open his mouth.
And I am as a man who is not hearing, and who has no rebukes in his mouth.
For I hope in You, O Jehovah; O Lord my God You will answer.
For I said, Lest they rejoice over me in the slipping of my foot; they exalt themselves over me.
For I am ready to fall and my pain is before me always.
For I will confess my perversity; I am anxious from my sin.
And my enemies are living; they are strong; and my haters multiply by falsehood.
And those who repay evil for good, they attack me, because the good follows me.
O Jehovah, do not forsake me! O my God, do not be far from me;
Make haste to help me, O my Lord, my salvation.

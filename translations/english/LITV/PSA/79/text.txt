A Psalm of Asaph. O God, the nations have come into Your inheritance; they have defiled Your holy temple; they have laid Jerusalem in heaps.
They have given the bodies of Your servants as food for the birds of the heavens; the flesh of Your saints to the beasts of the earth.
They have shed their blood like water all around Jerusalem, and there is no one burying.
We have become a shame to our neighbors a scorn and a mockery to those who are around us.
Until when, O Jehovah? Will You be angry with us forever? Shall Your jealousy burn like fire?
Pour out Your wrath on the nations who have not known You, and on the kingdoms who have not called on Your name.
For they have eaten up Jacob, and laid waste to his dwelling-place.
Oh do not remember for us the sins of our first ones; let Your tender mercies meet us speedily, for we have been brought very low.
Help us, O God of our salvation, for the matter of the glory of Your name; and deliver us and atone for our sins, for Your name's sake.
Why should the nations say, Where is their God? Let Him be known among the nations before our eyes, the avenging of the blood of Your servants that has been poured out.
Let the groaning of the prisoner come before You; according to the greatness of Your arm, preserve the sons of death.
And reward our neighbors sevenfold, Give into their bosom their curse with which they have cursed You, O Lord.
Then we Your people, and sheep of Your pasture, will give thanks to You forever; we will declare Your praise to all generations.

Praise Jehovah; for it is good to sing praise to our God; because praise is delightful and becoming.
Jehovah builds up Jerusalem; He gathers the outcasts of Israel.
He heals the broken-hearted and binds up their sorrows.
He appoints the number of the stars; He calls to them all by names.
Our Lord is great and of great might; there is no limit to His understanding.
Jehovah relieves the meek; He throws the wicked down to the ground.
Sing to Jehovah with thanksgiving; sing praise on the lyre to our God,
who covers the heavens with clouds; who prepares rain for the earth; who makes grass to grow on the mountains.
He gives the animals their food, to the young ravens that cry.
He takes no delight in the strength of the horse, nor any pleasure in the legs of a man.
Jehovah takes pleasure in those who fear Him, those who hope in His mercy.
Praise Jehovah, O Jerusalem; praise your God, O Zion.
For He has made strong the bars of your gates; He has blessed your sons within you.
He makes peace in your border, He satisfies you with the fat of the wheat.
He sends His command out on the earth; His word runs very swiftly;
He gives snow like wool; He scatters the white frost like ashes;
He casts out His ice like crumbs; who can stand before His cold?
He sends out His word and melts them; He causes His wind to blow, and the waters flow.
He declares His word to Jacob, His statutes and His judgments to Israel.
He has not done so with any nation; and they have not known His judgments. Praise Jehovah!

Of Solomon. Give the King Your judgments, O God; and Your righteousness to the King's son.
Your people He shall judge in righteousness, and Your poor in justice.
The mountains will lift up peace to the people; and the little hills through righteousness.
He shall judge the poor of the people; and He shall save the sons of the needy; and He shall crush the oppressor.
They shall fear You with the sun, and before the moon in all generations.
He shall descend like rain on the mown grass, like showers that water the earth.
In His days the righteous shall flourish, and plenty of peace, till the moon is not.
He shall also rule from sea to sea, and from the River to the ends of the earth.
Those dwelling in the desert will bow before Him, and His enemies will lick the dust.
The kings of Tarshish and of the isles shall bring presents; the kings of Sheba and Seba shall offer gifts.
Yea, all kings shall fall down before Him; all nations shall serve Him.
For He shall save the needy who cries, and the poor with no helper.
He shall have pity on the poor and needy; and He saves the souls of the needy ones.
He shall redeem their souls from oppression and violence; and their blood shall be precious in His eyes.
And He shall live, and the gold of Sheba shall be given to Him; and prayer shall be made for Him continually; He shall bless Him all the day long.
A fullness of grain shall be in the earth on top of the mountains; its fruit shall shake like Lebanon; and they of the city shall flourish like the grass of the earth.
His name shall be forever; His name shall continue before the sun; and they shall bless themselves by Him; all nations shall call Him blessed.
Blessed is Jehovah God, the God of Israel, who alone does wonderful things.
And blessed is His glorious name forever; and the whole earth is filled with His glory! Amen and amen!
The prayers of David the son of Jesse have ended.

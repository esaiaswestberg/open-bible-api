To the chief musician. A Psalm of David, to bring to remembrance. O God, deliver me! Hurry, O Jehovah, to help me!
Let those who seek after my soul be ashamed and turned pale; let them be turned backward and shamed, those who desire my evil.
Let them be turned back for a reward of their shame, those who say, Aha, aha!
Let all those who seek You rejoice, and be glad in You; and let those who love Your salvation forever say, Let God be magnified.
But I am poor and needy, come quickly to me, O God; You are my help and my deliverer; O Jehovah, do not wait any longer.

Of David. Bless Jehovah, O my soul; and all within me, bless His holy name.
Bless Jehovah, O my soul, and forget not all His rewards;
who forgives all your iniquities; who heals all your diseases;
who redeems your life from destruction; who crowns you with kindness and tender mercies;
who satisfies your desire with good; your youth is renewed like the eagle's.
Jehovah works righteousness and judgments for all the oppressed.
He made known His ways to Moses, His acts to the sons of Israel.
Jehovah is merciful and gracious, slow to anger, and of much mercy.
He will not always chasten, nor will He keep His anger forever.
He has not done to us according to our sins, nor rewarded us according to our iniquities.
For as the heavens are above the earth, so is His mercy mighty over those who fear Him.
As far as the east is from the west, so far has He removed our transgressions from us.
As the pity of a father over his sons, so Jehovah pities those who fear Him.
For He knows how we are made, remembering that we are dust.
As for man, his days are as grass; as the flower of the field, so he flourishes.
For the wind passes over it, and it is not; and its place never knows it again.
But the mercy of Jehovah is from everlasting, even to everlasting, on those who fear Him; yea, His righteousness is to the sons of sons;
to those who keep His covenant, and to those who remember His commandments, to do them.
Jehovah has prepared His throne in Heaven; and His kingdom rules over all.
Bless Jehovah, O angels of His; mighty in strength; doing His word; listening to the voice of His word.
Bless Jehovah, all His hosts, ministers of His, doing His will.
Bless Jehovah, all His works in all the places of His dominion; bless Jehovah, O my soul.

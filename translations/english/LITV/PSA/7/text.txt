A song of David, which he sang to Jehovah on the words of Cush the Benjamite. O Jehovah my God, I seek refuge in You; save me from all who pursue me, and deliver me;
lest he tear my soul like a lion, ripping, and there be no one to deliver.
O Jehovah, my God, if I have done this, if there is iniquity in my hands:
if I have repaid evil to my friend or I have plundered my vexer without cause,
let the enemy pursue and overtake my soul; yea, trample down my life to earth, and lay my honor in the dust. Selah.
Arise, O Jehovah, in Your anger; be lifted up at the rage of my vexers; and awake for Me! You have commanded judgment.
And the assembly of the peoples shall surround You, and over it You will return on high;
Jehovah will judge the people. O Jehovah, according to my righteousness, and according to my integrity on me.
Oh let the evil of the wicked come to an end; and You will establish the just; for the righteous God is a trier of hearts and reins.
My defense is on God, who saves the upright of heart.
God is a righteous judge; and God is angry with evildoers every day.
If he will not turn, He will whet His sword; He has trod His bow, He made it ready;
yea, He has fitted for him instruments of death. He will make ready His arrows for pursuers.
Behold, he writhes with iniquity and he will conceive mischief: and he has fathered falsehood;
he dug a pit and bored it, and has fallen into the ditch he made.
His mischief shall return on his own head, and his violence shall come down on his own crown.
I will thank Jehovah according to His righteousness, and will praise the name of Jehovah most high.

Jehovah reigns! He is clothed with majesty; Jehovah is clothed with strength; He girded Himself; and the world is established; it shall not be shaken.
Your throne is established from then; You are from everlasting.
The floods have lifted up; O Jehovah, the floods have lifted up their voice; the floods have lifted their roaring waves.
Jehovah on high is mightier than the noise of many waters, than the mighty waves of the sea.
Your testimonies are very sure; holiness becomes Your house to length of days, O Jehovah.

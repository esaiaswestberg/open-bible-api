To the chief musician. A Psalm of David. The heavens are recording the glory of God, and the expanse proclaim His handiwork.
Day by day they pour forth speech, and night to night reveals knowledge.
There is no speech, nor are there words where their voice is not heard.
Their measuring line has gone out through all the earth, and their words to the end of the world; in them He has set up a dwelling-place for the sun,
and he comes forth like a bridegroom from his canopy. He rejoices like a hero to run a race;
his going forth from the end of the heavens, and his orbit to their ends; and nothing is hidden from his heat.
The law of Jehovah is perfect, converting the soul. The testimony of Jehovah is sure, making the simple wise.
The precepts of Jehovah are right, rejoicing the heart; the commands of Jehovah are pure, giving light to the eyes.
The fear of Jehovah is clean, enduring forever; the judgments of Jehovah are true, they are righteous altogether.
They are more precious than gold, even much fine gold, and sweeter than honey and drops from the honeycomb.
Also Your servant is warned by them; in keeping of them is great reward.
Who can discern errors? Acquit me from secret faults ,
also withhold Your servant from arrogant sins ; do not let them rule over me; then I shall be upright, and shall be innocent from great transgression.
Let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be pleasing before You, O Jehovah, my Rock and my Redeemer.

To the chief musician. Do not destroy. A Psalm of Asaph. A Song. We have given thanks to You, O God; we have given thanks; for Your name is near; Your wonderful works have been told.
When I take the appointed time, I shall judge in uprightness.
The earth and all of its inhabitants are melting away; I set firm its pillars. Selah.
I said to the boastful, Do not boast; and to the wicked, Do not lift up the horn.
Do not lift up your horn on high; do not speak with a stiff neck.
For exaltations are not from the east, nor from the west, nor from the desert;
but God is the judge; He puts down this one and lifts up this other .
For a cup is in the hand of Jehovah; and the wine foams; it is fully mixed, and He pours out from it; surely all the wicked of the earth must drain its dregs and drink.
But I will witness forever; I will sing praises to the God of Jacob.
And I will cut off all the horns of the wicked; but the horns of the righteous shall be lifted up.

For the Sons of Korah. A Psalm. A Song. His foundation is in the holy mountains.
Jehovah loves the gates of Zion more than all the tents of Jacob.
Glorious things are spoken of you, O city of God. Selah.
I will mention Rahab and Babylon to those who know me; behold, Philistia and Tyre with Ethiopia; this man was born there.
And it shall be said to Zion, This man and that man was born in her; and the Highest Himself shall establish her.
In recording the peoples Jehovah shall mark down, This man was born there. Selah.
And the singers, the players of the pipe: all my springs are in You.

Rejoice in Jehovah, O righteous ones ; praise is becoming to the upright.
Give thanks to Jehovah with the lyre; sing to Him with a harp of ten strings.
Sing to Him a new song; play skillfully, with shouts of joy.
For the word of Jehovah is right, and all His works are in truth.
He loves righteousness and judgment; the mercy of Jehovah fills the earth.
Through Jehovah's word the heavens were made, and all their host by the breath of His mouth.
The waters of the sea were gathered like a heap, setting the depths in storehouses.
Let all the earth fear Jehovah; let all dwellers in the world stand in awe of Him.
For He spoke, and it came into being; He commanded, and it stood fast.
Jehovah brings the counsel of the nations to nothing; He frustrates the plans of the peoples.
Jehovah's counsel stands forever, the thoughts of His heart to all generations.
Blessed is the nation whose God is Jehovah, the people He has chosen for His inheritance.
Jehovah looks down from Heaven; He sees all the sons of mankind.
From His dwellingplace He looks on all the inhabitants of the earth.
He forms the heart; He understands all their works.
The king is not saved by great force; a mighty man is not saved by great strength.
A horse is a vain thing for safety; nor does he save by his great strength.
Behold the eye of Jehovah is to those who fear Him, on those who hope in His mercy;
to deliver their soul from death, and to keep them alive in famine.
Our soul waits for Jehovah; He is our help and shield.
For our heart rejoices in Him, because we trust in His holy name.
Let Your mercy be upon us, O Jehovah, even as we trust in You.

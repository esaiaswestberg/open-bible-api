To the chief musician. A Psalm for the sons of Korah. O Jehovah, You have been gracious to Your land; You have turned back the captivity of Jacob.
You have taken away the iniquity of Your people; You covered all of their sins. Selah.
You gathered all of Your wrath; You turned from the heat of Your anger.
O God of our salvation, turn us, and break up Your anger with us.
Will You be angry with us forever? Will You draw out Your anger to all generations?
Will You give us life anew, so that Your people may rejoice in You?
Cause us to see Your mercy, O Jehovah, and give us Your salvation.
I will hear what Jehovah God will say; for He will speak peace to His people, and His saints; but let them not turn again to folly.
Surely His salvation is near to fearers of Him, for glory to dwell in our land.
Mercy and truth have met together; righteousness and peace kissed each other .
Truth shall sprout out of the earth, and righteousness looks down from Heaven.
Yea, Jehovah shall give good, and our land shall give its produce.
Righteousness shall go before Him and shall make a way for His footsteps.

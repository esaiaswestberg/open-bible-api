To the chief musician. A Psalm of David. Until when will You forget me, O Jehovah? Forever? Until when will You hide Your face from me?
Until when shall I set counsel in my soul, having sorrow in my heart every day? Until when shall my enemy be lifted up over me?
Look! Answer me, O Jehovah, my God! Make my eyes gleam, lest I sleep the death;
lest my enemy say, I have overcome him and my foes rejoice when I am shaken.
But I have trusted in Your mercy. My heart shall rejoice in Your salvation.
I will sing to Jehovah, because He has rewarded me.

A Psalm of Asaph God, Jehovah God has spoken, and calls to the earth from the rising of the sun to its setting.
Out of Zion, the perfection of beauty, God has shone.
Our God comes, and He is not silent; a fire shall devour before Him; and it shall be very stormy around Him.
He shall call to the heavens from above, and to the earth, to judge His people.
Gather My saints together to Me, those who cut My covenant by sacrifice.
And the heavens shall declare His righteousness, for God Himself is judge. Selah.
Hear, My people, and I will speak; O Israel, and I will testify against you; I am God, your God.
I will not reprove you for your sacrifices; yea, your burnt offerings are continually before Me;
I will take no bull out of your house, nor he-goats out of your folds,
for every beast of the forest is Mine; the cattle on a thousand hills;
I know all the birds of the mountains; and all moving in My fields are Mine;
if I were hungry, I would not tell you; for the world is Mine, and the fullness of it.
Will I eat the flesh of mighty ones , and will I drink the blood of he-goats?
Offer thanksgiving to God; and pay your vows to the Most High.
And call on Me in the day of distress; and I will save you; and you shall glorify Me.
But to the wicked, God says, What is it to you to proclaim My statutes, and to take up My covenant on your mouth?
Yea, you hate instruction, and toss My words behind you?
When you saw a thief, you were pleased with him; and you have taken part with adulterers.
You give your mouth to evil, and your tongue frames deceit.
You sit; you speak against your brother; the son of your mother; you give slander.
You have done these things , and I have kept silence; you thought that surely I would be like you; but I will rebuke you and set in order before your eyes.
Now think of this, you who forget God, lest I tear, and not any to deliver:
Whoever offers thanks glorifies Me; and he who prepares a way, I will show the salvation of God to him.

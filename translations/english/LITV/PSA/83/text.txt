A Song. A Psalm of Asaph. O God do not keep silence to Yourself; do not be speechless; yea, do not be still, O God.
For lo, Your enemies are roaring; and those who hate You have lifted up their head.
They take shrewd counsel against Your people; they plot against Your hidden ones.
They have said, Come, and we will cut them off from being a nation; and, The name of Israel will not be recalled again.
For they plotted to together with one heart; they have cut a covenant against You;
even the tents of Edom, and of the Ishmaelites; Moab and the Hagarites;
Gebal and Ammon, and Amalek; Philistia and the inhabitants of Tyre.
Also Assyria has joined with them; they were an arm to the sons of Lot. Selah.
Do to them as to Midian, as to Sisera, as to Jabin at the torrent Kishon.
At Endor they were destroyed; they became dung for the ground.
Make their nobles as Oreb and Zeeb, and all their princes like Zebah and Zalmunna;
who said, Let us take possession of God's pastures for ourselves.
O my God, make them as whirling dust, as the stubble before the wind.
As the fire burns a forest, and as the flame sets the mountains on fire,
so pursue them with Your tempest, and frighten them with Your storm.
Fill their faces with shame and they will seek Your name, O Jehovah.
Let them be ashamed and terrified for ever; yea, let them be confounded and perish.
And let them know Your name is Jehovah, that You alone are the Most High over all the earth.

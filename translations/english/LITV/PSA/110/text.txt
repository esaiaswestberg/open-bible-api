A Psalm of David. A statement of Jehovah to my Lord: Sit at My right hand, until I place Your enemies as Your footstool.
Jehovah shall send the rod of Your strength out of Zion; rule in the midst of Your enemies.
Your people shall be willing in the day of Your power; in holy adornment from the womb of the dawn, to You is the dew of Your youth.
Jehovah has sworn and will not repent: You are a priest forever according to the order of Melchizedek.
The Lord at Your right hand shatters kings in the day of His anger.
He shall judge among the nations; He shall fill with dead bodies; He shall shatter heads over much land.
He shall drink out of the torrent on the way; therefore, He shall lift up the head.

There by the rivers of Babylon we sat down; also we wept when we remembered Zion.
We hung our lyres on the willows in its midst.
For there our captors asked us the words of a song; yea, our plunderers asked joy, saying , Sing to us a song of Zion.
How shall we sing the song of Jehovah on a foreign soil?
If I forget you, O Jerusalem, let my right hand forget;
let my tongue cleave to my palate, if I do not remember you, if I do not bring up Jerusalem above the head of my joy.
O Jehovah, remember for the sons of Edom the day of Jerusalem; who said, Make it bare! Make it bare even to its foundation!
O daughter of Babylon, O destroyed one! Blessed is he who shall repay to you your reward which you rewarded to us.
Blessed is he who seizes your little ones and dashes them against the stone!

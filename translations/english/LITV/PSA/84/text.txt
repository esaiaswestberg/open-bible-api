To the chief musician. On Gittith. A Psalm for the sons of Korah. How lovely are Your dwellings, O Jehovah of hosts!
My soul longs and even faints for the courts of Jehovah; my heart and my flesh cry out for the living God.
Even the sparrow has found a house, and the swallow a nest for herself, where she may lay her young, on Your altars, O Jehovah of hosts, my King and my God.
Blessed are they who dwell in Your house; they will always be praising You.
Blessed is the man whose strength is in You; Your ways are in their hearts.
Passing through the valley of weeping, they will make it a fountain; even the early rain covers with blessings.
They go from strength to strength, being seen in Zion before God.
O Jehovah God of hosts, hear my prayer; listen, O God of Jacob. Selah.
Behold, O God, our shield; and look upon the face of Your anointed.
For a day in Your courts is better than a thousand; I have chosen to stand at the threshold in the house of my God rather than to dwell in the tents of wickedness.
For Jehovah God is a sun and shield; Jehovah will give grace and glory; He will withhold nothing good from those who walk in integrity.
O Jehovah of hosts, blessed is the man who trusts in You!

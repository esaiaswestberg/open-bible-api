O sing to Jehovah a new song; sing to Jehovah, all the earth.
Sing to Jehovah; bless His name, bear news of His salvation day by day.
Tell of His glory among the nations, His wonders among all people.
For Jehovah is great and greatly to be praised; He is to be feared above all gods.
For all the gods of the peoples are idols; but Jehovah made the heavens.
Honor and majesty are before Him; strength and beauty are in His sanctuary.
Give to Jehovah, O families of the people; give to Jehovah glory and might.
Give to Jehovah the glory due His name; bring an offering and come in to His courts.
Oh worship Jehovah in the beauty of holiness; tremble before Him, all the earth.
Say among the nations, Jehovah reigns; and, The world shall be established, it shall not be moved; He shall judge the peoples in uprightness.
Let the heavens be glad, and let the earth rejoice; let the sea roar, and the fullness of it.
Let the field be joyful, and all that is in it; then the trees of the forest shall rejoice
before Jehovah; for He comes; for He comes to judge the earth; He shall judge the world with righteousness, and the people with His faithfulness.

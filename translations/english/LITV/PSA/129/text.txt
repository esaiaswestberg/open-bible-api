A Song of Ascents. Many times they have afflicted me from my youth, let Israel now say;
they have afflicted me from my youth many times, yet they have not prevailed over me.
The plowers plowed on my back; they made their furrows long.
Jehovah is righteous; He severs the cords of the wicked.
Let them be ashamed and turned back, all those who hate Zion;
let them be like the grass on the rooftops, which dries up before it draws out;
with which the reaper does not fill his palm, nor the binder of sheaves his bosom.
And those who pass by have never said, The blessing of Jehovah be on you; we bless you in the name of Jehovah.

Not to us, O Jehovah, not to us, but to Your name give glory; for Your mercy; because of Your truth.
Why do the nations say, Where is their God now?
But our God is in Heaven; He has done all that He has pleased.
Their idols are silver and gold, the work of man's hands;
they have mouths, but they do not speak; they have eyes, but they do not see;
they have ears, but they do not hear; they have a nose, but they do not smell;
their hands do not feel; their feet do not walk; they do not mutter through their throat.
The ones who make them are like them, and everyone trusting in them.
O Israel, trust in Jehovah; He is their help and their shield.
O house of Aaron, trust in Jehovah; He is their help and their shield.
You who fear Jehovah, trust in Jehovah; He is their help and their shield.
Jehovah remembers us; He will bless; He will bless the house of Israel; He will bless the house of Aaron;
He will bless those who fear Jehovah, the small and the great.
Jehovah will add on to you; on you and on your sons.
You are blessed to Jehovah, He who makes heavens and earth.
The heavens; the heavens are Jehovah's, but He has given the earth to the sons of men.
The dead do not praise Jehovah, nor all those who go down into silence;
but we will bless Jehovah, from now on and forever. Praise Jehovah!

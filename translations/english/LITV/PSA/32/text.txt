A Psalm of David. A Contemplation. Blessed is he whose transgression is lifted, whose sin is covered.
Blessed is the man to whom Jehovah does not charge iniquity, and in whose spirit there is no guile.
When I kept silence, then my bones became old, through my howling all day.
For by day and by night Your hand was heavy on me; my sap was turned into the droughts of summer. Selah.
I confessed my sin to You, and I have not hidden my iniquity; I said, I will confess over my transgression to Jehovah; and You forgave the iniquity of my sin. Selah.
On account of this let every godly one pray to You; at a time of finding, surely, when great floods come, they will not reach him.
You are my hiding place; You preserve me from trouble; You surround me with songs of deliverance. Selah.
I will instruct you and teach you in the way which you should go; I will counsel you, My eye shall be on you.
Be not like the horse, like the mule, with no understanding; with bit and bridle, his gear, to be held in, that they do not come near you.
Many sorrows are to the wicked; but he who trusts in Jehovah, mercy embraces him.
Be glad in Jehovah and rejoice, you righteous ones ; and all the upright in heart, shout for joy.

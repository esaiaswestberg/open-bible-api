A Song of Ascents. Out of the depths I have called You, O Jehovah.
Lord, hear my voice, and let Your ears attend to the voice of my prayers.
If You will keep iniquities, O Jehovah, O Lord, who shall stand?
But forgiveness is with You that You may be feared.
I wait for Jehovah; my soul waits, and I hope for His word.
My soul waits for the Lord more than morning-watchers watching for the morning.
Let Israel hope to Jehovah, for with Jehovah is mercy, and with Him is abundant redemption;
and He shall redeem Israel from all his iniquities.

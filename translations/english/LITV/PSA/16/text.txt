A Secret Treasure of David. Watch over me, O God, for I take refuge in You.
Oh my soul you have said to Jehovah, You are my Lord; My goodness is nothing apart from You.
As for the saints in the earth, they are the excellent ones; all my delight is in them.
Their sorrows shall multiply if they run after another god . I will not pour out their drink offering of blood; and I will not take their names on my lips.
Jehovah is the portion of my inheritance and of my cup; You shall surely uphold my destiny.
The lines have fallen to me in pleasant places ; yea, I have a beautiful inheritance.
I will bless Jehovah, who counseled me. My reins also teach me in the nights.
I have set Jehovah always before me; for He is at my right hand: I shall not be shaken.
So my heart is glad, and my glory rejoices; my flesh shall also rest in hope;
For You will not leave My soul in Sheol; You will not give Your Holy One to see corruption.
You will make Me know the way of life. In Your presence is fullness of joys; at Your right hand are pleasures forever.

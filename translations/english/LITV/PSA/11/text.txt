To the chief musician. A Psalm of David. I sought refuge in Jehovah; how can you say to my soul, Flee like a bird to your hill.
For behold! The wicked will tread the bow; they fixed their arrow on the string, in order to shoot with it at the upright of heart in the dark.
When the foundations are destroyed, what can the righteous do?
Jehovah is in His holy temple Jehovah, His throne is in the heavens; His eyes see; His eyelids will examine the sons of man.
Jehovah tries the righteous, but His soul hates the wicked and the lover of violence.
He shall rain snares on the wicked; fire and brimstone and a scorching wind shall be the portion of their cup.
For Jehovah is righteous; He loves righteous deeds; the upright look upon His face.

Praise Jehovah! Blessed is the man who fears Jehovah, delighting greatly in His commands.
His seed shall be mighty on the earth; the generation of the upright shall be blessed;
wealth and riches in his house; and his righteousness is standing forever.
Light rises in the darkness to the upright; he is gracious and full of pity, and of righteousness.
Good is a man showing favor and lending; he will nourish his matters with equity.
For he shall not be shaken forever; the righteous shall be for a memorial forever.
He shall not be afraid of evil news; his heart is fixed, trusting in Jehovah.
His heart is upheld; he shall not be afraid though he looks on his foes.
He has scattered; he has given to the needy; his righteousness is standing forever; his horn shall be lifted up with honor.
The wicked shall see and be vexed; he shall gnash his teeth and melt; the desire of the wicked shall perish.

To the chief musician, for eight-stringed instruments. A Psalm of David O Jehovah, do not rebuke me in Your anger; nor chasten me in the heat of Your fury;
have mercy on me, O Jehovah, for I am weak; heal me, O Jehovah, for my bones are troubled.
My soul also is greatly troubled and You, O Jehovah, until when?
O Jehovah, return, deliver my soul; save me for Your mercy's sake.
For there is no memory of You in death; who shall give thanks to You in Sheol?
I am weary in my groaning; I shall make by bed swim in all the night; I melt my couch with my tears.
My eye is dim because of grief; it wastes away because of all my vexers.
Depart from me, all workers of iniquity, for Jehovah has heard the voice of my weeping.
Jehovah has heard my plea; Jehovah will receive my prayer.
Let all my enemies be ashamed and greatly troubled; they shall turn back, ashamed in a moment.

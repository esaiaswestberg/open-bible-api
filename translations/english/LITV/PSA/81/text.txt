To the chief musician. On Gittith. Of Asaph. Sing aloud to God our strength; shout for joy to the God of Jacob.
Lift up a song, and the timbrel, the pleasing lyre with the harp.
Blow the ram's horn in the new moon, at the full moon, on our feast day.
For this was a statute for Israel, an ordinance of the God of Jacob.
This He ordained as a testimony in Joseph, when He went out over the land of Egypt; I heard a lip I did not understand.
I removed his shoulder from the burden; his hands were freed from the basket.
You called in distress, and I rescued you; I answered you in the secret place of thunder; I tested you at the waters of Meribah. Selah.
My people, listen, and I will testify against you, whether you will listen to Me:
There shall be no strange god among you; nor shall you worship a foreign god.
I am Jehovah your God who brought you out from the land of Egypt; open your mouth wide, and I will fill it.
But My people would not listen to My voice, and Israel did not consent to Me.
So I gave them up to the stubbornness of their own hearts; they walked in their own conceits.
Oh if My people had listened to me! If Israel had walked in My ways,
I would have subdued their enemies in a little; and I would have turned My hand against their foes.
the haters of Jehovah shall be found untrue to Him, and their time is forever.
Yea, He would have caused them to eat from the fat of the wheat; and I would have satisfied you with honey out of the rock.

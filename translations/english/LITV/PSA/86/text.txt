A Prayer of David O Jehovah, bow down Your ear, answer me, for I am poor and needy.
Guard my soul, for I am godly; O You my God, save Your servant who trusts in You.
Be gracious to Me, O Lord, for I cry to You daily.
Give joy to the soul of Your servant; for to You, O Lord, I lift up my soul.
For You, O Lord, are good and ready to forgive, and rich in mercy to all who call on You.
O Lord, give ear to my prayer; listen to my voice of supplications.
I will call on You in the day of my trouble, for You will answer me.
None among the gods is like You, O Lord, and none are like Your works.
All nations whom You have made shall come and worship before You; yea, Lord, they shall glorify Your name.
For You are great and do wonderful things; You alone are God.
Teach me Your way, O Jehovah; I will walk in your truth; unite my heart to fear Your name.
With all my heart I will thank You, O Lord my God; and I will glorify Your name forevermore.
For Your mercy toward me is great; and You have delivered my soul from the lowest Sheol.
O God, the proud have risen against me; and the troop of the violent have sought after my life, and have not set You before their eyes.
But You, O God, are God, full of pity; and gracious, longsuffering and rich in mercy and truth.
O turn to me and be gracious to me; give Your strength to Your servant, and save the son of Your handmaid.
Show me a token for good, that those who hate me may see and be ashamed, O Jehovah, because You have helped me and comforted me.

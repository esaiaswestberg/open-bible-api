He who dwells in the secret place of the Most High shall abide in the shade of the Almighty.
I will say to Jehovah: My Refuge and my Fortress, my God; I will trust in Him.
For He delivers you from the fowler's trap, from destruction's plague.
With His feathers He will cover you, and under His wings you shall seek refuge; His truth is a shield and buckler.
You shall not fear the terror of night, of the arrow that flies by day;
of the plague that walks in darkness, of the destruction laying waste at noonday.
A thousand shall fall by your side, and ten thousand at your right hand; it shall not come near you.
Only with your eyes you shall look, and see the reward of the wicked.
Because You, O Jehovah, are My refuge; if you make the Most High your habitation,
no evil shall happen to You, nor shall any plague come near Your tent.
For He shall give His angels charge over You, to keep You in all Your ways.
They shall bear You up in their hands, that You not dash Your foot on a stone.
You shall tread on the lion and adder; the young lion and the serpent You shall trample under foot.
Because he has set his love on Me, therefore I will deliver him; I will set Him on high because He has known My name.
He shall call on Me and I will answer Him; I will be with Him in distress; I will rescue Him and honor Him.
I will satisfy him with length of days and will make him see My salvation.

To the chief musician, on the harp. A Psalm of David. O Jehovah, our Lord, how majestic is Your name in all the earth; You have set Your glory above the heavens!
Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings, You have ordained strength, because of Your tormenters, to cause the enemy and the avenger to cease.
When I look upon Your heavens, the work of Your fingers: the moon and the stars which You have fixed;
what is man that You are mindful of him, and the son of man, that You visit him?
For You have made him lack a little from God; and have crowned him with glory and honor.
You made him rule over the works of Your hands; You have put all under his feet,
all flocks and oxen, and also the animals of the field,
the birds of the heavens, and the fish of the sea, all that pass through the sea.
O Jehovah, our Lord, how majestic is Your name in all the earth!

To the chief musician. Do not destroy. A secret treasure of David, when Saul sent, and they watched the house to kill him. Deliver me from my enemies, O my God; set me on high from the ones who rise up against me.
Deliver me from the workers of evil, and save me from bloody men.
For lo, they lie in wait for my soul, mighty ones gather against me; not for my transgression, and not my sin, O Jehovah.
Without my fault they run and prepare themselves; awaken to help me, and look on me .
And You, O Jehovah God of hosts, the God of Israel: Awake to visit all the nations; be not merciful to any plotting evil. Selah.
They return at evening; they howl like a dog, and go around the city.
Behold, they bellow with their mouth; swords are in their lips; for they say , Who hears?
But You, O Jehovah, shall laugh at them; you shall mock at all the nations.
O my Strength, let me look to You; for God is my strong tower.
The God of my mercy shall meet me; God shall let me see my desire on my enemies.
Do not kill them, lest my people forget; scatter them by Your power and bring them down, O Jehovah our shield.
For the sin of their mouth is the word of their lips, even let them be captured in their pride, and for cursing and the lying which they utter.
Consume them in Your anger; consume, so that they may not be; and they shall know that God is ruling in Jacob, to the ends of the earth. Selah.
Yes, they shall return at evening; let them howl like the dog and go around the city;
let them wander up and down for food, and growl if they are not satisfied.
But I will sing of Your power; yes, I will sing of Your mercy in the morning. For You have been my strong tower, and my hiding place in the day of my trouble.
To You, O my strength, I will sing; for God is my strong tower, the God of my mercy.

Praise Jehovah; praise Jehovah, O my soul.
While I live I will praise Jehovah; I will sing praises to my God while I have being.
Put not your trust in princes, in a son of man, for there is no salvation in him.
His breath will go out, he returns to the earth; his thoughts perish in that day.
Blessed is he who has the God of Jacob in his help; his hope is on Jehovah his God;
who made the heavens and the earth, the seas and all that is in them; who keeps truth forever;
who executes judgment for the oppressed; who gives food to the hungry; Jehovah sets free the prisoners;
Jehovah opens the eyes of the blind; Jehovah raises those bowed down; Jehovah loves the righteous;
Jehovah watches over the strangers; He relieves the orphan and the widow, but He warps the way of the wicked.
Jehovah shall reign forever; O Zion, your God from generation and generation. Praise Jehovah.

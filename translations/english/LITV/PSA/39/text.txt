To the chief musician, to Jeduthun. A Psalm of David. I said, I will keep my ways from sinning with my tongue; I will keep my mouth with a muzzle while the wicked are before me.
I became dumb, keeping still; from good I was silent, and my pain was stirred.
My heart was hot within me; while the fire burned I was meditating; I spoke with my tongue:
O Jehovah, make me to know my end and the limit of my days, what it is . Let me know how lacking I am .
Behold, like a handbreadth You gave my days, even my life was non-existence before You ;
surely every man walks about in shadow; surely they are in an uproar in vain; he heaps up and does not know who is gathering them.
And now what do I await, Lord? My hope is in You.
Deliver me from all my transgressions; do not set me forth as the reproach of the fool.
I was dumb; I did not open my mouth, because You had done it .
Remove Your stroke from me; I am consumed by the blow of Your hand.
You correct a man with rebukes over perversity; and as a moth You consume what he desires. Surely every man is vanity. Selah.
Hear my prayer, O Jehovah, and give ear to my cry. Do not be silent at my tears, for I am an alien with You, a pilgrim, as were all my fathers.
Look away from me and I will be cheerful before I go away and be no more.

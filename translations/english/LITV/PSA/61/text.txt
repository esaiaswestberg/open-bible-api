To the chief musician. On stringed instruments. Of David. Hear my cry, O God, and listen to my prayer.
From the end of the earth I call to You when my heart faints; Oh lead me to the Rock that is higher than I.
For You have been my shelter, a strong tower before the enemy.
I will dwell in Your tabernacle forever; I will trust in the shelter of Your wings. Selah.
For You, O God, have heard my vows; You appointed the inheritance of those who fear Your name.
You will add days to the days of the king; his years will be as generations to generations.
He shall abide forever before God; appoint mercy and truth to preserve him.
So I will sing praise to Your name forever, so that I may pay my vows day by day.

When Israel came out of Egypt, the house of Jacob from a people of strange language;
Judah became His sanctuary, Israel His kingdom.
The sea looked and fled; the Jordan turned back;
the mountains skipped like rams; the little hills like lambs!
What ails you, O sea, that you flee? O Jordan, that you turn back?
O mountains, that you skip like rams? O little hills, like lambs?
Tremble, O earth, from the face of the Lord, from the face of the God of Jacob;
who turned the rock into a pool of water, the flint into a fountain of waters.

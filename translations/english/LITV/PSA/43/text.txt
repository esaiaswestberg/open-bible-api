Judge me, O God, and strive for my cause against a nation not godly. Deliver me from the deceitful and unjust man.
For You are the God of my strength. Why have You cast me off? Why do I go mourning when the enemy oppresses?
Oh send out Your light and Your truth; let them lead me and bring me to the mount of Your holiness and to Your tabernacles.
Then I will go to the altar of God, to God, the joy of my delight, and I will thank with the lyre, O God, my God.
Why are you cast down, O my soul, and why do you moan within me? Hope in God, for I will still thank Him, the salvations of my face, and my God.

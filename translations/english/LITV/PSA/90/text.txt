A Prayer of Moses, the Man of God. O Lord, You have been our dwelling-place in all generations.
Before the mountains were born, or ever You had formed the earth and the world, even from everlasting to everlasting You are God.
You turn man to dust, and say, Return, O sons of men.
For a thousand years in Your eyes are as yesterday when it passes, and as a watch in the night.
You flooded them away; they are as a sleep; in the morning they are like grass growing;
in the morning it sprouts and shoots up; in the evening it withers and dries up.
For we are consumed by Your anger, and we are troubled by Your wrath.
You have set our iniquities before You, our secret sins in the light of Your face.
For all our days pass away in Your wrath; we finish our years like a murmur.
The days of our years are seventy; and if any by strength live eighty years, yet their pride is labor and vanity; for it soon passes, and we fly away.
Who knows the power of Your anger? And as Your fear is, so is Your fury.
So teach us to number our days, so that we may bring a heart of wisdom.
Return, O Jehovah! Until when? And give pity to Your servants.
O satisfy us in the morning with Your mercy, and we will be glad and rejoice all our days.
Make us glad according to the days of our affliction, the years in which we have seen evil.
Let Your work appear to Your servants, and Your majesty to their sons.
And let the delight of the Lord our God be upon us; and establish the works of our hands upon us; yea, the work of our hands, establish it!

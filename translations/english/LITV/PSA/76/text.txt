To the chief musician. For stringed instruments. A Psalm of Asaph. A Song of Praise. God is known in Judah; His name is great in Israel.
And His abode is in Salem; and His dwelling-place in Zion.
There He broke the fiery arrows of the bow, the shield, and the sword, and the battle. Selah.
You are glorious, more excellent than the mountains of prey.
The stouthearted have been stripped; they slept their sleep; and none of the men of might have found their hands.
By Your rebuke, O God of Jacob, both the horse and chariot have sunk into a sleep.
You, even You, are terrifying; and who can stand before You when You are angry?
You have caused judgment to be heard from Heaven; the earth feared and was stilled;
when God arose to judgment, to save all the meek of the earth. Selah.
For the wraths of man thank You; You encircle Yourself with the wraths left over.
Vow and pay to Jehovah your God; let all that are around Him bring presents to the Fearful One.
He shall cut off the spirit in princes; He is feared by the kings of the earth.

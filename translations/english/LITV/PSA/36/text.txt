To the chief musician; of the servant of Jehovah; of David. The oracle utters transgression to the wicked within my heart: There is no fear of God before his eyes.
For he flatters himself in his own eyes in order to find his iniquity, in order to hate it .
The words of his mouth are wickedness and deceit; he ceases to act wisely, to do good.
He plots evil on his bed; he sets himself on a way that is not good; he does not hate evil.
Your mercy, O Jehovah, is in the heavens; Your faithfulness to the dust clouds .
Your righteousness is like the hills of God; Your judgments are a great deep; O Jehovah, You preserve animal and man.
How precious is Your mercy, O God! And the sons of men take refuge in the shadow of Your wings.
They shall be satisfied from the abundance of Your house; and You make them drink the torrent of Your pleasures.
For with You is the fountain of life; in Your light we see light.
O continue Your mercy to the ones knowing You, and Your righteousness to the upright of heart.
Do not let the foot of pride come to me; and let not the hand of the wicked move me.
There the workers of evil have fallen; they are cast down and are not able to rise.

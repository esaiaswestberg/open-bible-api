To the chief musician, for stringed instruments, A Psalm of David. Answer me when I call, God of my righteousness. You gave room to me in distress. Have mercy on me and hear my prayer.
O sons of men, until when shall My glory be for a reproach? Will you love vanity? Will you run after a lie? Selah.
But know that Jehovah has set apart the godly for Himself. Jehovah hears when I call to Him.
Tremble and do not sin. Speak within your own heart on your bed and be still. Selah.
Offer the sacrifices of righteousness and trust in Jehovah.
Many are saying, Who will show us any good? O Jehovah, lift up the light of Your face on us.
You have put gladness in my heart, more than in the time their grain and their wine grew.
I will both lie down in peace and sleep; for You alone, O Jehovah, make me dwell in safety.

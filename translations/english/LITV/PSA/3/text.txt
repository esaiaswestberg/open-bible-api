A Psalm of David, when he fled from his son Absalom O Jehovah, how my adversaries have multiplied! Many are the ones who rise against me.
Many are saying of my soul, There is no salvation for him in God. Selah.
But You, O Jehovah, are a shield around me; my glory and He who lifts up my head.
I cried to Jehovah with my voice, and He heard me out of His holy mountain. Selah.
I laid down, and slept. I awoke, for Jehovah kept me.
I am not afraid of myriads of people who have been set against me all around.
Arise, O Jehovah! Save me, O my God. For You have struck all my enemies on the cheekbone. You have broken the teeth of the wicked.
Salvation belongs to Jehovah. Your blessing is on Your people. Selah.

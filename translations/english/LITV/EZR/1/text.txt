And in the first year of Cyrus King of Persia, so that the word of Jehovah by the mouth of Jeremiah might be fulfilled, Jehovah stirred up the spirit of Cyrus king of Persia, and he made a proclamation in all his kingdom, and also in writing, saying,
So says Cyrus king of Persia, Jehovah God of Heaven has given me all the kingdoms of the earth. And He has commanded me to build Him a house at Jerusalem, which is in Judah.
Who is there among you of all His people? His God is with him, and let him go up to Jerusalem, which is in Judah, and build the house of Jehovah, God of Israel (He is God) which is in Jerusalem.
And all who remain in any of the places where he resides, let the men of his place lift up him with silver, and with gold, and with property, and with animals, besides the freewill offering for the house of God that is in Jerusalem.
Then the chiefs of the fathers of Judah and Benjamin, and the priests, and the Levites, and everyone whose spirit God had awakened, rose up to go up to build the house of Jehovah which is in Jerusalem.
And all those who were around them made their hands strong with vessels of silver, with gold, with property, and with animals, and with precious things, besides all that was willingly offered.
Also Cyrus the king brought forth the vessels of the house of Jehovah, which Nebuchadnezzar had brought out of Jerusalem and had put them in the house of his gods.
Even those Cyrus king of Persia brought forth by the hand of Mithredath the treasurer, and numbered them to Sheshbazzar, the prince of Judah.
And this is the number of them: thirty platters of gold, a thousand platters of silver, twenty one knives,
thirty basins of gold, four hundred and ten silver basins of a second kind , a thousand other vessels.
All the vessels of gold and of silver (five thousand and four hundred) Sheshbazzar made to go up all when the exiled were caused to go up from Babylon to Jerusalem.

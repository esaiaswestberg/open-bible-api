Who can give You to me, as my brother, who sucked the breasts of my mother? When I find You outside, I would kiss You. They also would not despise me.
I would lead You; I would bring You into my mother's house, that You might teach me; I would cause You to drink the spiced wine from the juice of my pomegranate.
His left hand would be under my head, and His right hand embracing me.
I adjure you, O daughters of Jerusalem; why should you stir up or why should you awaken my love until it pleases?
Who is this that comes up from the wilderness, leaning on her Beloved? I awakened you under the apple tree; there your mother travailed with you; there she travailed; she bore you.
Set me as a seal on Your heart, as a seal on Your arm. For love is strong as death; jealousy is cruel as Sheol; its flames are flames of fire, a flame of Jehovah.
Many waters cannot quench love, nor will the rivers overflow it. If a man would give all the wealth of his house for love, they surely would despise him.
We have a little sister, and she has no breasts. What shall we do for our sister in the day she shall be spoken for?
If she is a wall, we will build a turret of silver on her. And if she is a door, we will enclose her with boards of cedar.
I was a wall, and my breasts like towers; then I was in His eyes as one finding peace.
Solomon had a vineyard in Baal-hamon. He let the vineyard out to keepers; for its fruit everyone was to bring a thousand of silver.
My vineyard which is mine is before me; the thousand is for you, O Solomon, and two hundred for the keepers of its fruit.
You who dwell in the gardens, the companions are listening to your voice; cause me to hear it .
Hurry, my Beloved, and be like a gazelle, or a young deer, the stag, on the mountains of spices.

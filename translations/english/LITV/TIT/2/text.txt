But you speak things which become sound doctrine:
aged men to be temperate, sensible, discreet, sound in faith, in love, in patience;
aged women likewise in reverent behavior, not slanderers, not having been enslaved by much wine, teachers of good,
that they might train the young women to be lovers of husbands, lovers of children,
discreet, chaste, keepers at home, good, subject to their own husbands, so that the word of God may not be blasphemed,
the younger men in the same way exhort to be discreet;
having shown yourself a pattern of good works about all things in doctrine, in purity, sensibleness, incorruption,
in sound speech, not to be condemned; that he who is opposed may he ashamed, having nothing bad to say about you.
Let slaves be subject to their own masters, well-pleasing in all things , not speaking against them ,
not stealing, but showing all good faith, that they may adorn the doctrine of our Savior God in all things.
For the saving grace of God has appeared to all men,
instructing us that having denied ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live discreetly and righteously and godly in the present age,
looking for the blessed hope and appearance of the glory of our great God and Savior Jesus Christ,
who gave Himself on our behalf, "that He might redeem us from all iniquity" "and purify" "a people" "for His own possession," zealous of good works. Psa. 130:8; Eze. 37:23; Deut. 14:2
Speak these things and exhort and convict with all authority. Let no one despise you.

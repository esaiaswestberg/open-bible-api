And he made me see Joshua the high priest standing before the Angel of Jehovah, and Satan standing at his right hand to accuse him.
And Jehovah said to Satan, Jehovah rebuke you, Satan! And, Jehovah who has chosen Jerusalem rebuke you! Is this not a brand plucked out of the fire?
And Joshua was clothed with filthy garments, and he stood before the Angel.
And He answered and spoke to those who stood before Him, saying, Take away the filthy garments from him. And He said to him, Behold, I have caused your iniquity to pass from you, and I will clothe you with ceremonial robes.
And I said, Let them set a clean turban on his head. And they set a clean turban on his head and clothed him with clothing. And the Angel of Jehovah stood by.
And the Angel of Jehovah charged Joshua, saying,
So says Jehovah of hosts: If you will walk in My ways, and if you will keep My charge, then you shall also judge My house, and shall also keep My courts, and I will give you room to walk among these who stand by.
Hear now, O Joshua the high priest, you and your associates who are sitting before you; for they are men of symbol.
For, behold, I will bring forth My Servant, the BRANCH. For behold, the stone which I have given before Joshua, on the one stone are seven eyes. I will engrave its engraving, says Jehovah of hosts, and I will remove the iniquity of that land in one day.
In that day, says Jehovah of hosts, you shall invite each man to his neighbor to sit under the vine and under the fig tree.

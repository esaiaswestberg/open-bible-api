Everywhere it is heard that fornication is among you, and such fornication which is not named among the heathen, so as one to have his father's wife.
And you are puffed up, and have not rather mourned, that he that did this deed might be taken from your midst.
For as being absent in body, but being present in spirit, I have already judged the one who has worked out this thing, as if I were present:
In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, you being gathered together with my spirit also, with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ,
to deliver such a one to Satan for destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus.
Your boast is not good. Do you not know that a little leaven leavens all the lump?
Then purge out the old leaven so that you may be a new lump, even as you are unleavened. For also Christ our Passover was sacrificed for us.
So let us keep the feast, not with old leaven, nor with leaven of malice and of evil, but with unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.
I wrote to you in the letter not to associate with fornicators;
and not altogether with the fornicators of this world, or with the covetous, or with plunderers, or with idolaters, since then you must go out of the world.
But now I wrote to you not to associate intimately; if anyone is called a brother and is either a fornicator, or a covetous one, or an idolater, or a reviler, or a drunkard, or a plunderer, with such a one not to eat.
For what is it to me also to judge the ones outside? Do you not judge those inside?
But God will judge the ones outside. "And you shall put out the evil one from you." Deut. 17:7

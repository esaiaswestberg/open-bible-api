And when I came to you, brothers, I did not come with excellency of word or wisdom, declaring to you the testimony of God.
For I decided not to know anything among you except Jesus Christ, and Him having been crucified.
And I was with you in weakness, and in fear, and in much trembling.
And my word and my preaching was not in moving words of human wisdom, but in proof of the Spirit and of power,
that your faith might not be in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God.
But we speak wisdom among the perfect, but not the wisdom of this age, nor of the rulers of this age, those being brought to nothing.
But we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery, having been hidden, which God predetermined before the ages for our glory,
which none of the rulers of this age has known. For if they had known, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory;
according as it has been written, "Eye has not seen, and ear has not heard," nor has it risen up into the heart of man, the things which God has prepared for those that love Him. Isa. 64:4
But God revealed them to us by His Spirit, for the Spirit searches all things, even the depths of God.
For who among men knows the things of a man, except the spirit of a man within him? So also no one has known the things of God except the Spirit of God.
But we have not received the spirit of the world, but the Spirit from God, so that we might know the things that are freely given to us by God.
Which things we also speak, not in words taught in human wisdom, but in words taught of the Holy Spirit, comparing spiritual things with spiritual things .
But a natural man does not receive the things of the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness to him, and he is not able to know them , because they are spiritually discerned.
But the spiritual one discerns all things, but he is discerned by no one.
For "who has known the mind of the Lord?" "Who will teach Him?" But we have the mind of Christ. Isa. 40:13

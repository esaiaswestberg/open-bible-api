And the king and Haman came to the banquet of queen Esther.
And the king said again to Esther on the second day of the banquet of wine, What is your petition, queen Esther, and it shall be given to you. And what is your request? It shall be done, to the half of the kingdom.
And Esther the queen answered and said, If I have found favor in your eyes, O king, and it pleases the king, let my life be given me at my petition, and my people at my request.
For we are sold, my people and I, for destruction, for murder and for perishing. But if we had been sold for male slaves and slave-girls, I would have kept silent, though the adversary could not make up for the king's loss.
And king Ahasuerus answered and said to Esther e queen, Who is he, this one? And where is this one, he who is filled with pride in his heart to do so?
And Esther said, A man, an enemy, and a hating one, Haman! This evil one! And Haman was afraid before the king and the queen.
And the king, rising from the banquet of wine in his wrath, went into the palace garden. And Haman remained to beg for his life from Esther the queen, for he saw that evil was determined against him by the king.
And the king returned out of the garden to the place of the banquet of wine. And Haman had fallen on the couch on which Esther lay . And the king said, Will he also ravish the queen with me in the house? The word went from the king's mouth, and they covered Haman's face.
And Harbonah, one of the eunuchs, said before the king, Also, look! The wooden gallows which Haman made for Mordecai, who had spoken good toward the king, is standing at Haman's house. And the king said, Hang him on it!
And they hanged Haman on the wooden gallows which he had prepared for Mordecai. And the king's wrath lay down.

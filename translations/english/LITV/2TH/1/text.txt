Paul and Silvanus and Timothy to the church of Thessalonians in God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ:
Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
Brothers, we are bound to give thanks to God always concerning you, even as it is right, because your faith grows exceedingly, and the love of each one of you multiplies toward one another,
so as for us to boast ourselves in you in the churches of God for your patience and faith in all your persecutions, and the afflictions which you endure,
a clear token of the just judgment of God, for you to be counted worthy of the kingdom of God, for which you indeed suffer;
since it is a just thing with God to pay back tribulation to the ones troubling you,
and to give you, those being troubled, relief with us at the revelation of the Lord Jesus from Heaven with angels of His power,
in flaming fire giving full vengeance to those not knowing God, and to those not obeying the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ, Isa. 66:15; Jer. 10:25
who will pay the penalty: everlasting destruction from the face of the Lord, "and from the glory of His strength," Isa. 2:20
when He comes to be glorified in His saints, and to be admired in all those who believe in that Day, because our testimony to you was believed.
For which we also continually pray concerning you, that our God would count you worthy of the calling, and would fulfill all the good pleasure of His goodness, and work of faith in power,
so that the name of our Lord Jesus Christ may be glorified in you, and you in Him, according to the grace of our God and of the Lord Jesus Christ.

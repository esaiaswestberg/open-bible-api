And Jehoshaphat the king of Judah returned to his house in peace to Jerusalem.
And Jehu the son of Hanani, the seer, went out before him and said to king Jehoshaphat, Do you love to help the bad one, and those who hate Jehovah, and by this bring wrath on you from the face of Jehovah?
But good things have been found with you, for you have burned the Asherahs out of the land, and have fixed your heart to seek God.
And Jehoshaphat lived in Jerusalem, and he went out again among the people, from Beersheba to the hills of Ephraim, and brought them back to Jehovah the God of their fathers.
And he placed judges in the land, in all the fortified cities of Judah, for every city;
and said to the judges, Watch what you are doing, for you shall not judge for man, but for Jehovah, and He is with you in the matter of judgment;
and now, let the fear of Jehovah be upon you; watch and act, for there is no perverseness with Jehovah our God, nor lifting up of faces, nor taking of a bribe.
And also in Jerusalem Jehoshaphat caused to stand from the Levites and from the priests, and from the heads of the fathers of Israel, for the judgment of Jehovah, and for strife; and they returned to Jerusalem.
And he charged them, saying, So shall you do in the fear of Jehovah, faithfully, and with a perfect heart.
And when any contention shall come to you from your brothers who are living in their cities, between blood and blood between law and commandment, statutes and judgments, then you shall warn them, and they shall not be guilty before Jehovah; and wrath shall not be on you and on your brothers; so you shall do, and you shall not be guilty.
And, behold, Amariah the chief priest shall be over you for every matter of Jehovah, and Zebadiah the son of Ishmael, the ruler of the house of Judah, shall be for every matter of the king; and the Levites shall be officers before you. Be strong and act; and Jehovah shall be with the good.

Wisdom has built her house; she has carved out her seven pillars;
she has slaughtered her slaughter; she has mixed her wine; she has also set her table.
She has sent out her maidens; she cries on the highest places of the city;
The simple one, turn in here; and to one lacking heart, she says to him:
Come, eat of my bread, and drink of the wine I have mixed.
Forsake the foolish, and live, and go in the way of understanding.
He who reproves a scorner gets shame to himself; and he who rebukes a wicked man gets his own blot.
Do not reprove a scorner, that he not hate you; rebuke a wise man, and he will love you.
Give to a wise one, and he will be more wise; teach a just one, and he will increase in learning.
The fear of Jehovah is the beginning of wisdom; and the knowledge of the Holy Ones is understanding.
For by me your days shall be multiplied, and the years of your life shall be increased.
If you are wise, you shall be wise for yourself, but if you scorn, you alone shall bear it .
A foolish woman is loud; she is thoughtlessness, and she knows not what.
And she sits at the door of her house, in a seat in the high places of the city,
to call those who pass by, who are going straight on their ways:
The simple one, let him turn in here; and to the one lacking heart, she says to him:
Stolen waters are sweet, and bread eaten in secret is pleasant.
But he does not know that the departed spirits are there; her guests are in the depths of hell.

To the chief musician, To die for the Son. A Psalm of David. I will give thanks, O Jehovah, with all my heart; I will tell of all Your wonderful acts;
I will be glad and rejoice in You; I will praise Your name, O Most High.
When my enemies turn back, they will fall and perish before You.
For You have maintained my right and my cause; You sat on the throne judging right.
You have rebuked the nations; You have destroyed the wicked; You have put out their name forever and ever.
The desolations of the enemy are ended forever; and You have uprooted the cities; their memory has perished with them.
But Jehovah is seated forever; He has established His throne for judgment.
And He shall judge the world in righteousness; He shall judge the peoples in uprightness.
Jehovah also will be a refuge for the oppressed, a refuge in times of distress.
And those who know Your name will put their trust in You; for You, Jehovah, have not forsaken those who seek You.
Sing praises to Jehovah who dwells in Zion; declare His deeds among the nations.
For He remembers them, the seeker of bloodshed; He does not forget the cry of the afflicted.
Be gracious to me, O Jehovah; see my affliction from my haters, be lifting me up from the gates of death,
So that I may declare all Your praises in the gates of the daughter of Zion; I will rejoice in Your salvation.
The nations have sunk into the pit they made; their foot is caught in the net they hid.
Jehovah has been known, He has executed judgment; the wicked is snared in the work of his own hands. A meditation, Selah.
The wicked shall be turned to Sheol, all the nations forgetting God.
For the needy shall not forever be forgotten; the hope of the poor shall not perish forever.
Arise, O Jehovah! Do not let man have strength; let the nations be judged before Your face.
O Jehovah, put fear in them; let the nations know they are but men. Selah.

A Psalm of David. O Jehovah, I cry to You; hasten to me; hear my voice when I cry to You.
Let my prayer be established before You as incense; the lifting up of my palms as the evening sacrifice.
O Jehovah, set a guard to my mouth; keep watch on the door of my lips.
Do not let my heart turn aside to any evil thing, to practice deeds in wickedness with men who do evil; and do not let me eat of their delicacies.
Let the righteous strike me; it is a mercy; and he rebuking me, it is oil of the head, let not my head refuse it ; for yet my prayer also shall be against their evils.
Their judges have been dashed against the rock; they shall hear my words for they are pleasant.
As when one plows and tears the earth, so our bones are scattered at the mouth of Sheol.
But my eyes are on You, O Jehovah, my Lord; in You I take refuge; do not make my soul naked.
Keep me from the hands of the trap they laid for me, and from the snares of the workers of evil.
Let the wicked fall into their own nets at the same time; I even shall pass by.

To the Chief musician on Mahalath. A Contemplation; A Psalm of David. The fool has said in his heart, There is no God! They have done corruptly; they have committed abominable wickedness; there is not one doing good!
God looked down from Heaven on the sons of mankind, to see if there was any discerning, who was seeking God:
Every one has turned away; together they are filthy; not one is doing good; not even one!
Have the workers of evil not known, eating up My people as they eat bread? They have not called on God.
There they dreaded with dread, where no dread was; for God has scattered the bones of the one who besieges you; you have put them to shame because God rejects them.
Who gives from Zion the salvation of Israel? When God brings back the captivity of His people, Jacob shall rejoice; Israel shall be glad.

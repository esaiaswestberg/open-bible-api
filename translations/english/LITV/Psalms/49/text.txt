To the chief musician, A Psalm for the Sons of Korah. Hear this all peoples listen, all inhabitants of the world.
Both sons of mankind and sons of man together, rich and poor:
My mouth shall speak wisdoms; and the thoughts of my heart shall be of understanding.
I will bow down my ear to a parable; I will open my dark saying on the harp.
Why should I fear in the days of evil, when the perversity of my ambushers will surround me?
Those who trust in their wealth, and in their many riches, boast themselves.
A man cannot at all redeem a brother, nor give to God a ransom for him,
for the redemption of their soul is precious, and it ceases forever,
for he shall yet live forever; he shall never see corruption.
For he sees wise men die; together the fool and the animal-like ones perish and leave their riches to others.
Their inward thought is that their houses shall last forever, their dwelling-places to all generations; they call lands after their own names.
But man shall not remain high in honor; he is like the animals; they shall be cut off.
This way of theirs is folly to them, yet their followers shall be pleased by their mouth. Selah.
Like sheep, they are appointed to Sheol; death shall reign for them; and upright ones shall rule over them in the morning; and their form is for rotting; Sheol is home for him.
But God will redeem my soul from the hand of Sheol; for He will take me. Selah.
Do not be afraid when one becomes rich, when the glory of his house increases;
for when he dies, he shall take nothing; his glory shall not go down after him.
For in his life he blessed his soul; yea, men praise you when you do well for yourself.
He shall go to the generation of his fathers; they shall not see light forever.
Man, though high in honor, but understanding not, is like the animals; they shall be cut off.

A Psalm, A Song for the Sabbath Day. It is good to give thanks to Jehovah, and to sing praises to Your name, O Most High;
to make Your mercy known in the morning, and Your faithfulness every night;
on the ten strings , and on the harp; on the lyre with sounding music.
For You have rejoiced me with Your work, O Jehovah; I will shout in the works of Your hands.
O Jehovah, Your purposes are very deep. How great are Your works!
An animal-like man does not know; a fool does not understand this.
When the wicked flourish like grass, and all the evildoers blossom, it is for them to be destroyed forever.
But You, O Jehovah, are exalted forever.
For, lo, Your enemies, O Jehovah; for, lo, Your enemies shall perish; all the evildoers shall be scattered.
But You will lift up my horn as the wild ox, and I will be anointed with fresh oil.
And my eye shall look on my enemies; my ears shall hear the evildoers who rise up against me.
The righteous shall flourish as the palm tree; he shall grow like a cedar in Lebanon.
Those planted in the house of Jehovah, in the courts of our God, shall flourish.
They shall bear fruit in old age; they shall be fat and fresh,
to declare that Jehovah is upright, my Rock! And in Him is no evil.

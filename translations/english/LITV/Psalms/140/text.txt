To the chief musician. A Psalm of David. O Jehovah, deliver me from the evil man; keep me from the violent man,
who devises evil things in the heart; they gather wars all the day.
They sharpen their tongues like a snake; adders' poison is under their lips. Selah.
O Jehovah, keep me from the wicked's hands; keep me from the violent man who plans to trip up my steps.
The proud have hidden cords and a trap for me; they have spread a net by the wayside; they have set snares for me. Selah.
I said to Jehovah, You are my God; O Jehovah, hear the voice of my prayers.
O Jehovah the Lord, the strength of my salvation, You have covered my head in the day of armor.
O Jehovah, do not grant the desires of the wicked; do not promote his plan, lest they be exalted. Selah.
As for the leaders of those around me, let the evil of their own lips cover them.
Let burning coals fall on them; let them fall on coals of fire; make them fall into deep pits so that they do not rise again.
Do not let a man of tongue be established in the earth; evil shall hunt the violent man, thrust upon thrust.
I know that Jehovah will maintain the cause of the afflicted, the justice of the poor.
Surely the righteous shall give thanks to Your name; the upright shall dwell in Your presence.

Praise Jehovah! Sing to Jehovah a new song, His praise in the assembly of the saints.
Let Israel rejoice in His Makers; let the sons of Zion be joyful in their Kings.
Let them praise His name in the dance; let them sing praise to Him with the timbrel and lyre.
For Jehovah takes pleasure in His people; He beautifies the meek with salvation.
Let the saints be joyful in glory; let them sing aloud on their beds.
Let the exaltation of God be in their throat, and a two-edged sword in their hand,
to execute vengeance on the nations, punishment on the peoples;
to bind their kings with chains and their nobles with iron bands;
to execute on them the judgment written; this is an honor for all His saints. Praise Jehovah!

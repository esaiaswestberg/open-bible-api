To the chief musician. A Song. A Psalm. Make a joyful noise to God, all the earth;
Sing out the honor of His name; give glory to His praise.
Say to God, How fearful are Your works! Through the greatness of Your power, Your enemies pretend obedience to You.
All the earth shall worship You; and they sing to You; they praise Your name. Selah.
Come and see God's works, who is awesome in His acts toward the sons of men.
He turns the sea into dry land ; they go through the river on foot; there we will rejoice with Him.
He rules by His power forever; His eyes search out the nations; let not the rebels exalt themselves. Selah.
Bless our God, O peoples, and make heard the voice of His praise;
Who holds our soul in life and does not allow our foot to slide.
For You, O God, have proved us; You have tested us as silver is refined.
You have brought us into the net; You laid afflictions on our loins.
You have let men ride at our head; we went through fire and through water, but You brought us out to plenty.
I will go into Your house with burnt offerings; I will pay You my vows,
which my lips have opened, and my mouth has spoken in my trouble.
I will offer burnt sacrifices of fatlings to You, with the incense of rams; I will offer bulls with goats. Selah.
Come, hear, and let me tell, all you who fear God, what He has done for my soul.
I cried to Him with my mouth, and exaltations were under my tongue.
If I had regarded iniquity in my heart, Jehovah would not have heard.
Surely, God has heard; He has attended to the voice of my prayer.
Blessed be God, who has not turned away my prayer and His mercy from me!

A Psalm of David. To You, O Jehovah, I lift up my soul.
O my God, I trust in You; do not let me be ashamed; let not my enemies triumph over me.
Yea, let no one who waits on You be ashamed; let those who vainly sin be ashamed.
Make me know Your ways, O Jehovah; teach me Your paths;
lead me in Your truth, and teach me; for You are the God of my salvation; on You I wait all the day long.
Remember, O Jehovah, Your compassions and Your mercies; for they are from eternity.
Do not remember the sins of my youth, or my transgressions. According to Your mercy, remember me, for Your goodness' sake, O Jehovah.
Good and upright is Jehovah; therefore He will teach sinners in the way.
He will guide the meek in justice; and He will teach the meek His way.
All the paths of Jehovah are mercy and truth to the keepers of His covenant and His testimonies.
For Your name's sake, O Jehovah, even pardon my iniquity for it is great.
What man is he who fears Jehovah? He teaches him the way he should choose.
His soul shall abide in good, and his seed shall inherit the earth.
The secret of Jehovah is with those who fear Him; and He will make them know His covenant.
My eyes are ever toward Jehovah; for He shall bring my feet out of the net.
Turn to me and be gracious to me, for I am lonely and afflicted.
The straits of my heart are enlarged; O bring me out from my straits.
Look on my affliction and my pain, and lift up all my sins.
Look on my enemies, for they are many; they hate me with a violent hatred.
Keep my soul and deliver me let me not be ashamed, for I have sought refuge in You.
Let purity and uprightness keep me, for I wait on You.
Redeem Israel, O God, out of all his distresses.

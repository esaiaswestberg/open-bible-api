Blessed is the man who has not walked in the counsel of the ungodly, and has not stood in the way of sinners and has not sat in the seat of scorners.
But his delight is only in the law of Jehovah, and he meditates in His law day and night.
And he shall be like a tree planted by the rivulets of waters, which will give its fruit in its seasons, and its leaf will not wither, and all which he does will prosper.
Not so are the wicked, but they are only as chaff which the wind drives about.
On account of this the wicked shall not stand in the judgment, nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous.
For Jehovah is knowing the way of the righteous, and the way of the wicked shall perish.

A Psalm of David, when he changed his behavior before Abimelech; and he drove him away, and he went. I will bless Jehovah at all times; His praise shall always be in my mouth.
My soul shall make its boast in Jehovah; the humble shall hear and be glad.
O magnify Jehovah with me; and let us exalt His name together.
I sought Jehovah, and He answered me, and delivered me out of all my fear.
They looked to Him and were filled with light; and their faces were not ashamed.
This poor man cried, and Jehovah heard, and saved him out of all his troubles.
The Angel of Jehovah camps around those who fear Him, and He delivers them.
Taste and see that Jehovah is good; blessed is the man who trusts in Him.
Fear Jehovah, His holy ones, for they who fear Him lack nothing.
The young lions have lacked and been hungry; but they who seek Jehovah shall not lack any good thing.
Come, listen to me, my sons, I will teach you the fear of Jehovah.
Who is the man who desires life, who loves days in order to see good?
Keep your tongue from evil, and your lips from speaking guile;
depart from evil and do good; seek peace and pursue it.
The eyes of Jehovah are on the righteous; and His ears are open to their cry.
The face of Jehovah is against those who do evil, to cut off their memory from the earth.
The righteous cry, and Jehovah hears, and saves them out of all their distresses.
Jehovah is near those who are broken-hearted, and saves those who have a contrite spirit.
Many are the evils of the righteous, but Jehovah helps him out of them all,
keeping all his bones; not one of them is broken.
Evil shall slay the wicked, and those who hate the righteous shall become guilty.
Jehovah is redeeming the soul of His servants; and none of those who trust in Him shall be guilty.

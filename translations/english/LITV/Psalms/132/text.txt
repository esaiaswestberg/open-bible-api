A Song of Ascents. O Jehovah, remember David with all his afflictions;
how he swore to Jehovah; he vowed to the Mighty One of Jacob,
If I will go into the tent of my house, if I go up on the couch of my bed,
if I give sleep to my eyes, slumber to my eyelids,
until I search out a place for Jehovah, dwellings for the Mighty One of Jacob.
Lo, we have heard of it at Ephratah; we found it in the fields of the forest;
we will enter into His tabernacles; we will worship at His footstool.
Arise, O Jehovah, into Your rest; You, and the ark of Your strength;
Let Your priests be clothed with righteousness, and let Your saints shout for joy.
For Your servant David's sake do not turn away the face of Your anointed.
Jehovah has sworn to David in truth; He will not turn from it; I will set one of the fruit of your body on the throne for you.
If your sons will keep My covenant and My testimonies which I will teach them, their sons shall also sit on your throne till forever.
Jehovah has chosen Zion; He has desired it for His dwelling-place.
This is My rest till forever; I will dwell here; I have desired it.
I will surely bless her food; I will satisfy her poor with food.
And I will clothe her priests with salvation; and her saints shall surely shout.
I will make the horn of David to sprout; I have prepared a lamp for My anointed.
I will clothe his enemies with shame; but his crown shall shine upon him.

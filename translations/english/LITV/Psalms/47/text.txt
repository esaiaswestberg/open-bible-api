To the chief musician. A Psalm for the Sons of Korah. All the peoples clap the hand; shout aloud to God with the voice of shouting.
For Jehovah Most High is awesome, a great king over all the earth.
He shall speak peoples under us, even nations under our feet.
He chooses our inheritance for us, the majesty of Jacob whom He loved. Selah.
God has gone up with a shout, Jehovah with the sound of a ram's horn.
Sing praise; sing praise; sing praise to our King, sing praise!
For God is the king of all the earth; sing a psalm for edification.
God reigns over the nations; God sits on the throne of His holiness.
The nobles of peoples gather together, the people of the God of Abraham. For the shields of the earth are God's; He is greatly lifted up.

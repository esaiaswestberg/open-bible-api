To the chief musician, for flutes. A Psalm of David Give ear to my words, O Jehovah; consider my meditation.
Attend to the voice of my cry, my King and my God; for I will pray to You.
You will hear my voice in the morning, O Jehovah, I will set myself for You in the morning, and I will look up.
For You are not a God enjoying wickedness; nor shall evil live with You.
The boasters shall not set themselves before Your eyes. You hate all workers of iniquity.
You shall destroy those speaking lies; Jehovah will despise the man of blood and deceit.
But I, in the plenty of Your grace, I will come into Your house. I will worship in Your fear toward Your holy temple, O Jehovah.
Lead me in Your righteousness, because of my enemies; make straight Your way before me.
For there is no faithfulness in their mouth; their inward part is engulfing ruin; their throat is an open grave; they flatter with their tongue.
O God, hold them guilty; let them fall from their own counsels. Drive them away in the multitude of their transgressions, for they have rebelled against You.
But let all who put their trust in You rejoice; let them shout for joy forever, because You cover them. And let those who love Your name be joyful in You.
For You, O Jehovah, will bless the righteous; You will surround him with favor, as with a shield.

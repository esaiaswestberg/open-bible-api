A Psalm. O sing to Jehovah a new song, for He has done wondrous things; His right hand and His holy arm has saved Him.
Jehovah has revealed His salvation; He unveiled His righteousness to the eyes of the nations.
He has remembered His mercy and His faithfulness to the house of Israel; all the ends of the earth have seen the salvation of our God.
Make a joyful noise to Jehovah, all the earth; break out and rejoice and sing praise.
Sing praise to Jehovah with the lyre; with the lyre and the voice of a song.
With trumpets and the sound of a horn, make a joyful noise before Jehovah the King.
Let the sea roar, and the fullness of it; the world, and those who live in it.
Let the rivers clap their hands; let the heights shout for joy together
before Jehovah; for He comes to judge the earth; with righteousness He shall judge the world, and the peoples in uprightness.

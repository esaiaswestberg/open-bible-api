A Psalm; a Song of Dedication of the House of David. I will exalt You, O Jehovah; for You have lifted me up, and have not allowed my foes to rejoice over me.
O Jehovah my God, I cried to You, and You have healed me.
O Jehovah, You have brought up my soul from Sheol; You have kept me alive, from going down into the Pit.
Sing praises to Jehovah, O saints of His; and give thanks to the memory of His holiness.
For His anger is only a moment; in His favor is life. Weeping may endure in the evening, but joy comes in the morning.
And in my prosperity, I said, I shall never be moved forever.
O Jehovah, in Your favor You have made my strong mountain to stand You hid Your face; I was troubled;
I called to You, O Jehovah; yea, I prayed to Jehovah.
What profit is in my blood, in going down to the Pit? Shall the dust praise You? Shall it tell of Your truth?
Hear, O Jehovah, and favor me; O Jehovah, be my helper.
You have turned my mourning into dancing for me; You have loosed my sackcloth and have clothed me with gladness.
So my glory shall praise You, and not be quiet; O Jehovah, my God, I will give thanks to You forever.

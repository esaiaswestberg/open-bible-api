To the chief musician. On the Lily of Testimony. A secret treasure of David, to teach; when he struggled with Aram-naharaim, and with Aram-zobah; when Joab returned, and struck twelve thousand of Edom in the Valley of Salt. O God! You cast us off; You broke us; You who were angry; take us back.
You made the earth tremble; You tore it; heal its breaks, for it is shaking.
You have shown Your people hardship; You made us drink the wine of trembling.
You have given a banner to those who fear You, to lift it up because of the truth. Selah.
Save with Your right hand and answer me, that Your beloved may be delivered.
God has spoken in His holiness; I will rejoice; I will divide Shechem, and measure out the valley of Succoth.
Gilead is Mine, and Manasseh is Mine; Ephraim is the strength of My head; Judah is My lawgiver;
Moab is My washpot; over Edom I will cast out My shoe; over me, Philistia, shout in triumph.
Who will bring me into the strong city? Who will lead me into Edom?
Have not You, O God, cast us aside? And will You not go forth with our armies, O God?
Give us help against our foe, for vain is the deliverance of man.
Through God we shall do mighty things; for He shall tread on our foes.

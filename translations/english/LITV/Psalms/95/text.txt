O come, let us sing to Jehovah; let us make a joyful noise to the Rock of our salvation.
Let us come before His face with praise; let us shout for joy to Him with songs.
For Jehovah is a great God, and a great King above all gods.
The deep places of the earth are in His hand; the summits of the mountains also are His.
The sea is His, and He made it, and His hands formed the dry land.
O come, let us worship and bow down; let us kneel before Jehovah our Maker.
For He is our God; and we are the people of His pasture, and the sheep of His hand. Today, if you will hear His voice,
do not harden your heart as in the day of strife, as in the day of testing in the wilderness;
When your fathers tempted Me, they tested Me and they saw My work.
For forty years I was disgusted with this generation; and I said, They are a people who err in heart; and, They do not know My ways,
to whom I swore in My anger, They shall not enter into My rest.

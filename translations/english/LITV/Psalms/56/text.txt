To the chief musician. Concerning the silent dove, those far off. Of David, a secret treasure (when the Philistines seized him in Gath). Favor me, O God, for man snuffs me up; all the day fighting oppresses me.
My watchers panted for me all the day; for many are proudly fighting against me.
The day I am afraid, I will trust in You.
In God I will praise His word; in God I have trusted; I will not fear; what will flesh do to me?
All the day they pervert my words; all their thoughts are against me for evil.
They stir up strife; they hide; they observe my footprints as they wait for my soul.
Is escape for them by iniquity? In anger the peoples cast down, O God.
You have counted my wandering; O put my tears in Your bottle; are they not in Your Book?
Then my enemies will turn back in the day I call; this I know, for God is for me.
In God I will praise the Word; in Jehovah I will praise the Word.
In God I have trusted; I will not fear; what will man do to me?
On me, O God, are Your vows; I will render to You thank offerings.
For You have delivered my soul from death. Do You not keep my feet from falling, so that I may walk before God in the light of the living?

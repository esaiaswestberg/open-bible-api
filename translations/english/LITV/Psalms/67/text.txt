To the chief musician, for stringed instruments. A Psalm. A song. May God be merciful to us and bless us, and cause His face to shine upon us. Selah.
That Your way may be known on earth, Your salvation among all nations.
Let the peoples thank You, O God; let all the peoples thank You.
Oh let the peoples be glad and sing for joy; for You shall judge the peoples uprightly and govern the peoples on earth. Selah.
Let the peoples give thanks to You, O God; let all the peoples give thanks to You.
The earth has given its increase; God, our own God, shall bless us.
God shall bless us; and all the ends of the earth shall fear Him.

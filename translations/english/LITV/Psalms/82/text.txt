A Psalm of Asaph God stands in the assembly of God; He judges in the midst of the gods.
Until when will you judge unjustly, and lift up the faces of the wicked? Selah.
Judge the poor and fatherless; do justice to the afflicted and needy.
Deliver the poor and needy; save out of the hand of the wicked.
They neither know nor will understand; they walk in darkness; all the foundations of the earth are shaken.
I have said, You are gods, and all of you are sons of the Most High.
But you shall die as men, and fall like one of the rulers.
Rise, O God, judge the earth; for You shall inherit in all the nations.

A Psalm of David. Judge me, O Jehovah, for I have walked in my integrity; I also have trusted in Jehovah; I shall not slide.
Examine me, O Jehovah, and prove me; purify my reins and my heart.
For Your mercy is before my eyes; and I have walked in Your truth.
I have not sat with lying men; and I will not go in with hypocrites;
I have hated the assembly of evildoers, and I will not sit with the wicked.
I will wash my hands in innocency; so I will go around Your altar, O Jehovah,
to cause to hear with the voice of thanksgiving, and recount all Your wonderful works.
O Jehovah, I have loved the place of Your house, and the place where Your glory dwells.
Do not take away my soul with sinners, nor my life with bloody men,
in whose hand is a plot, and their right hand is full of a bribe.
But I will walk in my integrity; redeem me and be gracious to me.
My foot stands in an even place; in the assemblies, I will bless Jehovah.

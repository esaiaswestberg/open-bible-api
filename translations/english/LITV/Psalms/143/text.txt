A Psalm of David. Hear my prayer, O Jehovah give ear to my supplications; answer me in Your faithfulness, in Your righteousness;
and do not enter into judgment with Your servant; for not anyone living is just in Your sight.
For the enemy has pursued my soul; he has beaten my life to the ground; he has made me dwell in darkness like the dead of old.
And my spirit within me has fainted; my heart within me is stunned.
I remember the days of old. I meditate on all Your works; I muse on the work of Your hands.
I spread out my hands to You; my soul thirsts to You like a thirsty land. Selah.
O Jehovah, answer me quickly; my spirit is failing; do not hide Your face from me lest I be like the ones who go down to the Pit.
Cause me to hear Your mercy in the morning, for I do trust in You; cause me to know the way I should walk, for I lift up my soul to You.
O Jehovah, deliver me from my enemies; to You I have hidden.
Teach me to do Your will; for You are my God; Your Spirit is good; lead me into the land of justice.
O Jehovah, because of Your name, enliven me; in Your righteousness, bring my soul out of distress.
And in Your mercy cut off my enemies; and destroy all those who afflict my soul; for I am Your servant.

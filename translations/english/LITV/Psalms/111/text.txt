Praise Jehovah! I will thank Jehovah with all my heart; in the council of the upright, and of the assembly.
The works of Jehovah are great, sought out by all those desiring them.
His work is honorable and glorious; and His righteousness is standing forever.
He has made a memorial for His wonders; Jehovah is gracious and full of pity.
He has given food to those who fear Him; He will always remember His covenant.
He has shown to His people the power of His works, to give to them inheritance of the nations.
The works of His hands are truth and all His commandments are true,
standing firm forever and ever; they are done in truth and uprightness.
He sent redemption to His people; He has commanded His covenant forever; holy and awesome is His name.
The fear of Jehovah is the beginning of wisdom; all who practice them have a good understanding; His praise is standing forever!

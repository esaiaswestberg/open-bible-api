To the chief musician. A Contemplation. A Psalm of David when Doeg the Edomite came and told Saul, and said to him, David has come to the house of Ahimelech. Why do you boast yourself in evil, O hero? The mercy of God is all the day.
Like a sharp razor, your tongue devises ruin, working deceit.
You love evil more than good; lying more than to speak righteousness. Selah.
You love all devouring words, O deceitful tongue!
God will likewise break you forever; He shall take you away, even pluck you from your tent, and uproot you out of the land of the living. Selah.
And the righteous shall see and fear; yea, they will laugh over him, saying ,
Behold, the man who did not make God his strength; but he trusted in his many riches; he was strong in his destruction.
But I am like a green olive tree in the house of God; I trust in the mercy of God forever and ever.
I will thank You forever, because You have done it ; and I will hope in Your name, for it is good before Your saints.

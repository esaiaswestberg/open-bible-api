To the chief musician. A Psalm of David. The fool has said in his heart, There is no God! They acted corruptly; they did hatefully in deeds; there is none doing good.
Jehovah looked down from Heaven on the sons of mankind, to see if there were any discerning and seeking God:
they have all turned aside; together they have become filthy; there is none doing good; not even one!
Have all evildoers not known, eating My people as they eat bread? They have not called on Jehovah.
There they were afraid of terror, for God is in the righteous generation.
You have shamed the counsel of the afflicted, for Jehovah is his refuge.
Who will bring the salvation of Israel out of Zion? When Jehovah brings back the captivity of His people, Jacob shall rejoice; Israel shall be glad.

A Psalm of David, when he was in the wilderness of Judah. O God, You are my God; I earnestly seek You; my soul thirsts for You; my flesh longs for You, as in a dry and weary land without water.
Therefore I have seen you in the holy place, seeing Your power and Your glory.
For Your loving-kindness is better than life; my lips give praise to You.
So I will bless You while I live; I will lift up my hands in Your name.
My soul shall be satisfied, as with marrow and fatness; and my mouth shall praise You with joyful lips,
when I remember You upon my bed. I will meditate on You in the night watches.
For You have been a help to me, and I will rejoice under the shadow of Your wings.
My soul is cleaved after You; Your right hand upholds me.
And those who seek to destroy my life shall go into the depths of the earth.
They shall pour him out by the sword; they shall be a serving for jackals.
But the king shall rejoice in God; everyone who swears by Him shall glory, because the mouth of the one speaking a lie will be stopped.

A Song of Ascents. When Jehovah turned back the captivity of Zion, we were like those who dream.
Then our mouth was full of laughter, and our tongue with joyful shouting; then they said among the nations, Jehovah will work great things with these.
Jehovah did great things to work with us; we are glad.
Turn her captivity again, O Jehovah, like the south streams.
Those who sow in tears shall reap with joyful shouting.
Surely he who walks and weeps, bearing a trail of seed, shall come again with joyful shouting, bearing his sheaves.

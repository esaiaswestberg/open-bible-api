A Song. A Psalm of David. O God, my heart is fixed; I will sing; yea, I will sing songs even with my glory.
Awake, harp and lyre! I will awake early;
I will thank You, O Jehovah, among the peoples; and I will sing to You among the nations.
For Your mercy is great above the heavens; and Your truth reaches to the clouds.
Be lifted up, O God, above the heavens; and Your glory above all the earth;
O that Your beloved may be delivered; save by Your right hand and answer me.
God has spoken in His holiness; I will rejoice; I will portion out Shechem; and I will measure out the valley of Succoth.
Gilead is Mine; and Manasseh is Mine; and Ephraim is the fort of My head; Judah is My lawgiver;
Moab is My washpot; I will throw My shoe out over Edom; I will shout in triumph over Philistia.
Who will lead me into the fortified city? Who will lead me over Edom?
O God, have You not cast us off? And, O God, will You not go out with our armies?
Give help to us from distress; for the deliverance of man is vain.
In God we shall do mighty things, for He shall trample our foes.

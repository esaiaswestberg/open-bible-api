To the chief musician. Do not destroy. A secret treasure of David. Will you indeed speak righteousness in silence? Do you judge uprightly, O sons of men?
Yes, in heart you work the evil, you weigh the violence of your hands in the land.
The wicked are estranged from the womb; they go astray from the belly, speaking lies.
Their poison is like the poison of a snake; like the deaf adder, he stops his ear,
which will not hear the charmer's voice, skillful caster of spells.
O God, break their teeth in their mouth; break out the big teeth of the young lions, O Jehovah.
Let them melt away like waters; they flow off to them; he treads his arrows; let them be as though they were cut off;
Let them be as a snail goes into melting, a miscarriage of a woman; they do not see the sun.
Before your pots can feel the thorns, whether green or glowing, He shall sweep it away.
The righteous shall rejoice when he sees vengeance; he shall wash his feet in the blood of the wicked.
And man will say, Truly, a fruit is to the righteous; truly, there is a God judging in the earth.

A Song of Ascents. Blessed is everyone who fears Jehovah, who walks in His ways.
For you shall surely eat the labor of your hands; you shall be happy, and all is good to you.
Your wife shall be like a fruitful vine by the sides of your house; your sons shall be like olive plants around your table.
Behold! So shall the man be blessed who fears Jehovah.
Jehovah shall bless you out of Zion; and you shall see the good of Jerusalem all the days of your life.
Yes, you shall see the sons of your sons. Peace be upon Israel!

An Instruction of David, a Prayer, in his being in the cave. I cry to Jehovah with my voice; I pray to Jehovah with my voice.
I pour out my musing before Him; I declare my distress before Him.
When my spirit faints within me, then You know my path; they have hidden a snare for me in the path in which I walk.
I look to the right hand and see, and no one recognizes me; every escape is hidden from me; no one inquires for my soul.
I cried to You, O Jehovah; I said, You are my refuge, my portion in the land of the living.
Attend to my cry; for I am brought very low; deliver me from those who pursue me; for they are stronger than I.
Bring my soul out from prison to give thanks to Your name; the righteous shall gather around me; for You shall deal bountifully with me.

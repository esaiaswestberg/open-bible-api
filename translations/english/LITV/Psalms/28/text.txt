A Psalm of David. I will call to You, O Jehovah; my Rock, be not deaf to me, lest, if you be silent from me I may be compared with those going down into the Pit.
Hear the voice of my prayers in my crying to You, when I lift my hands toward Your Holy of Holies.
Draw me not away with the wicked, and with the workers of iniquity; who speak peace with their neighbors, yet evil is in their hearts.
Give to them according to their deeds and according to the evil of their practices; as is the work of their hands, give to them, repay their deeds to them.
Because they pay no attention to the works of Jehovah, and to the works of His hands, He will destroy them, and not build them up.
Blessed be Jehovah, because He has heard the voice of my prayers.
Jehovah is my strength and my shield; my heart trusted in Him, and I am helped; yea, my heart greatly rejoices; and I will thank Him with my song.
Jehovah is their strength, and He is the stronghold of the salvations of His anointed.
Save Your people and bless Your inheritance and feed them, and lift them up forever.

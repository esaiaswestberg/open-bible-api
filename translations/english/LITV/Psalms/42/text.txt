To the chief musician. A Contemplation for the sons of Korah. As the deer pants after the channels of water, so my soul pants after You, O God.
My soul thirsts for God, for the living God; when shall I come and appear before God?
My tears have been my food by day and by night, while they say to me all the day long, Where is your God?
When I remember these things and I pour out my soul on me (for I passed over with the throng; I led them to the house of God with the voice of rejoicing and praise, a host keeping the feast).
Oh my soul, why are you cast down and moan within me? Hope in God, for I shall yet thank Him for the salvation of His presence.
O my God, my soul is cast down within me; on account of this I remember You from Jordan-land and from the Hermons, from Mount Mizar.
Deep calls to deep through the voice of Your waterfalls; all Your waves and Your billows have passed over me.
Jehovah will command His loving-kindness by day, and His song shall be with me in the night, a prayer to the God of my life.
I will say to God my Rock, Why have You forgotten me? Why do I go mourning when the enemy oppresses me?
My oppressors reproach me with crushing in my bones. when they say to me every day, Where is your God?
O my soul, why are you cast down? And why do you moan within me? Hope in God, for I yet thank Him for the salvation of my face and my God.

To the chief musician. To Jeduthun. A Psalm of David. Only to God is my soul silent; from Him comes my salvation.
He alone is my rock and my salvation, my strong tower; I shall not be greatly moved.
Until when will you break in against a man? You will shatter him, all of you, like a bowing wall, a tottering fence.
Surely, they plotted to cast him down from his excellent dignity; they delight in lies; they bless with their mouth, but they curse in their heart. Selah.
Only be silent to God, O my soul, for my hope comes from Him.
He alone is my rock and my salvation, my strong tower; I shall not be shaken.
On God is my salvation and my glory; my strong rock, my refuge is in God.
Trust in Him at every time, you people; pour out your heart before Him; God is a refuge for us. Selah.
Surely the sons of men are vanity, the sons of man are a lie; they go up in the scales; they are higher than vanity together.
Trust not in oppression, and do not be vain in robbery; if riches increase to you, do not set your heart on them.
God has spoken once; twice I have heard this, that power belongs to God;
Also mercy belongs to You, O Lord, for You reward a man according to his work.

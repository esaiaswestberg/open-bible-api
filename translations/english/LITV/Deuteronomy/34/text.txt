And Moses went up from the plains of Moab to Mount Nebo, the top of Pisgah, which is opposite Jericho. And Jehovah caused him to see all the land; Gilead to Dan;
and all Naphtali, and the land of Ephraim, and Manasseh, and all the land of Judah to the sea beyond;
and the Negeb, and the plain of the valley of Jericho, the city of palm trees, to Zoar.
And Jehovah said to him, This is the land which I have sworn to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, saying, I will give it to your seed. I have caused you to see with your eyes, but you shall not cross over there.
And Moses the servant of Jehovah died there in the land of Moab, according to the command of Jehovah.
And He buried him in a valley in the land of Moab, opposite Beth-peor; and no man knows his grave to this day.
And Moses was a son of a hundred and twenty years at his death; his eye had not become dim, nor had his natural force abated.
And the sons of Israel mourned Moses in the plains of Moab thirty days. And the days of weeping and mourning for Moses were ended.
And Joshua the son of Nun was full of the spirit of wisdom, for Moses had laid his hands on him. And the sons of Israel listened to him and did as Jehovah commanded Moses.
And never since has a prophet like Moses arisen in Israel, whom Jehovah knew face to face,
in regard to all the signs and wonders which Jehovah sent him to do in the land of Egypt, to Pharaoh, and to all his servants and to all his land;
and in regard to all the mighty hand, and in all the great terror which Moses showed in the sight of all Israel.

And He cried in my ears with a loud voice, saying, Let the overseers of the city draw near, even each with his destroying weapon in his hand.
And, behold, six men were coming from the way of the Upper Gate, which faces north. And each had his shattering weapon in his hand. And one man among them was clothed in linen, and an ink horn of a scribe at his loins. And they went in and stood beside the bronze altar.
And the glory of the God of Israel had gone on, from on the cherub where it was on it, to the threshold of the house. And He called to the man clothed in linen with the ink horn of a scribe at his loins.
And Jehovah said to him, Pass through in the midst of the city, in the midst of Jerusalem, and mark a mark on the foreheads of the men who are groaning and are mourning over all the abominations that are done in her midst.
And He said to those in my hearing, Pass over in the city after him and strike. Do not let your eye spare, and do not have pity.
Slay old men , choice men, and virgins, and children, and women, all to destruction. But to every man who has the mark on him, do not come near. And begin from My sanctuary. And they began with the old men who were before the house.
And He said to them, Defile the house and fill the courts with the slain. Go forth! And they went out and killed in the city.
And it happened as they struck, and I remained, even I. Then I fell on my face and I cried out and said, Ah, Lord Jehovah! Will You destroy all the remnant of Israel in Your pouring out of Your fury on Jerusalem?
And He said to me, The iniquity of the house of Israel and of Judah is very great, and the land is filled with blood, and the city is full of perversity. For they say, Jehovah has forsaken the land; and, Jehovah does not see.
And even I, My eye does not spare, and I will not have pity. I will put their way on their head.
And, behold, the man clothed with linen, with the ink horn at his loins, reported the matter, saying, I have done as You commanded me.

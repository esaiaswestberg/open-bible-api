And the word of Jehovah was to Jonah the second time, saying,
Rise up, go to Nineveh, the great city, and cry out to it the proclamation that I am declaring to you.
And Jonah rose up and went to Nineveh according to the word of Jehovah. And Nineveh was a great city to God, of three days' journey.
And Jonah began to enter a day's journey into the city. And he cried out and said, Yet forty days and Nineveh shall be overthrown!
And the men of Nineveh believed in God, and they called a fast and put on sackclothes, from the greatest of them even to the least of them.
And the word touched even to the king of Nineveh, and he arose from his throne, and he took his robe from him and covered himself with sackcloth and sat on the ashes.
And he cried and said in Nineveh by the decree of the king and of his great ones, saying, Do not let man or beast, herd or flock, taste anything; do not let them feed nor let them drink water.
But let man and beast be covered with sackcloth. And let them call with strength to God. And let them each one turn from his evil way, and from the violence that is in their palms.
Who knows? He may turn, and God may have pity and turn away from the glow of His anger, that we do not perish.
And God saw their works, that they turned from their evil way. And God was compassionate over the evil that He had declared to do to them, and He did not do it .

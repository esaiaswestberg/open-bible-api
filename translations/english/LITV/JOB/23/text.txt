And Job answered and said:
Even today my complaint is bitter; my hand is heavy over my groaning.
Oh that I knew where I might find Him, I would come into His seat;
I would order my cause before Him, and I would fill my mouth with arguments.
I would know the words He would answer me, and understand what He would say to me.
Would He plead against me with greatness of strength? No, surely He would put it in me.
There the righteous might reason with Him; and I would be forever delivered from my Judge.
Behold, I go forward, but He is not there ; and backward, but I do not see Him;
to the left where He works, but I cannot see; He turns to the right, but I do not see Him .
But He knows the way with me. When I am tried, I shall come forth as gold.
My foot has held fast in His steps; I have kept His way and have not turned;
nor have I departed from the command of His lips; I treasured the words of His mouth more than my portion.
But He is in one mind , and who can turn Him? Yea, His soul desires, and He does it .
For He fulfilled my lot, and many like these are with Him.
On account of this I am troubled from His presence; I consider, and am in dread of Him.
For God makes my heart weak, and the Almighty troubles me.
In this I was not cut off by darkness; yea, He covered the thick darkness from my face.

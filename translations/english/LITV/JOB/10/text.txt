My soul loathes my life; I will leave my complaint on myself; I will speak in the bitterness of my soul.
I will say to God, Do not condemn me; make me know why You contend with me.
Is it good to You that You should crush, that You should despise the work of Your hands, and You shine on the counsel of the wicked?
Have You eyes of flesh; or do You see as a man sees?
Are Your days as the days of man? Or your years like the days of man,
that You seek out my iniquity, and search for my sin?
You know that I am not wicked; and there is no one delivering out of Your hand.
Your hands have made me and shaped me together all around; yet You destroy me.
Remember, I beseech You, that You have formed me as clay; and will You bring me to dust again?
Did You not pour me out like milk; yea, curdled me like cheese?
You clothed me with skin and flesh, and knitted me with bones and sinews.
You have made me have life and favor, and Your providence has kept my spirit.
And these You have hidden in Your heart; I know that this was with You.
If I sin, then You watch me; and You will not acquit me from my guilt.
If I am wrong, woe to me! And if I am righteous, I will not lift up my head, being filled with shame and seeing my pain.
And if it rise, You would hunt me as a lion; and again You show Yourself wonderful in me.
You renew Your witnesses against me, and increase Your anger with me; changes and warfare are with me.
Why then did You bring me from the womb? I would have died, and no eye seen me.
I would have been as though I had never been, carried from the womb to the grave.
Are not my days few? Then cease and set me alone, that I may take a little comfort
before I go; and I shall not return; to the land of darkness, and the shadow of death;
a land of obscurity, the darkness of the shadow of death, and without any order; even the shining is as darkness.

And Job answered and said:
How have you helped the powerless, or saved the arm with no strength?
How have you advised the ones not wise or fully declared wise plans?
With whom have you spoken words? And whose breath came forth from you?
The departed spirits are made to writhe from beneath the waters, and their inhabitants.
Sheol is naked before Him, and the Pit has no covering.
He stretched out the north over the empty place; and He hung the earth on nothing.
He binds up the waters in His thick clouds; and the cloud does not burst under them.
He covers the face of His throne, spreading His cloud over it.
He has described a circle on the surface of the waters to the boundary of light with darkness.
The pillars of the heavens tremble and are stunned at His rebuke.
With His power He quiets the sea, and by His understanding He shatters pride.
By His Spirit the heavens were beautiful; His hand pierced the fleeing snake.
Lo, these are the edges of His ways; yea, what a whisper of a word we hear of Him! And the thunder of His might, who can understand?

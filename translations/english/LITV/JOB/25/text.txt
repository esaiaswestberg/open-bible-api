And Bildad the Shuhite answered and said:
Rule and fear are with Him. He makes peace in His high places.
Is there any number of His armies? And on whom does His light not rise?
How then can man be justified with God? Or how can one who is horn of a woman be pure?
Behold, even the moon, and it is not bright; and the stars are not pure in His eyes;
how much less man who is a maggot; and the son of man who is a worm!

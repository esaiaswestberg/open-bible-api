For this reason, I, Paul, the prisoner of Christ Jesus on behalf of you, the nations,
if, indeed, you heard of the stewardship of the grace of God given to me for you,
that by revelation He made known to me the mystery, as I wrote before in brief,
by the reading of which you are able to realize my understanding in the mystery of Christ,
which was not made known to the sons of men in other generations, as it now has been revealed to His holy apostles and prophets in the Spirit,
for the nations to be joint-heirs, and a joint-body and joint-sharers of His promise in Christ through the gospel,
of which I was made a minister according to the gift of the grace of God given to me, according to the working of His power.
This grace was given to me, less than the least of all the saints, to proclaim the gospel of the unsearchable riches of Christ among the nations,
and to bring to light all, what is the fellowship of the mystery having been hidden from eternity in God, the One creating all things through Jesus Christ,
so that now to the rulers and to the authorities in the heavenlies might be made known through the church the manifold wisdom of God,
according to the eternal purpose which He accomplished in Christ Jesus our Lord,
in whom we have boldness and access in confidence through His faith.
Therefore, I ask you not to faint at my troubles on your behalf, which is your glory.
For this reason I bow my knees to the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,
of whom every family in Heaven and on earth is named,
that He may give you, according to the riches of His glory, by His power to become mighty in the inward man through His Spirit,
that through faith Christ may dwell in your hearts, having been rooted and founded in love,
that you may be given strength to grasp, with all the saints, what is the breadth and length and depth and height,
and to know the love of Christ which surpasses knowledge, that you may be filled to all the fullness of God.
Now to Him being able to do exceedingly above all that we ask or think, according to the power working in us,
to Him be the glory in the church in Christ Jesus, to all the generations of the age forever. Amen.

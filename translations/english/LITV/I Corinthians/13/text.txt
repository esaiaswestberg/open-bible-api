If I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, but I do not have love, I have become as sounding brass or a clanging cymbal.
And if I have prophecies, and know all mysteries and all knowledge, and if I have all faith so as to move mountains, but do not have love, I am nothing.
And if I give out all my goods, and if I deliver my body that I be burned, but I do not have love, I am not profited anything.
Love has patience, is kind; love is not envious; love is not vain, is not puffed up;
does not behave indecently, does not pursue its own things, is not easily provoked, thinks no evil;
does not rejoice in unrighteousness, but rejoices in the truth.
Love quietly covers all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things.
Love never fails. But if there are prophecies, they will be caused to cease; if tongues, they shall cease; if knowledge, it will be caused to cease.
For we know in part, and we prophesy in part;
but when the perfect thing comes, then that which is in part will be caused to cease.
When I was an infant, I spoke as an infant, I thought as an infant, I reasoned as an infant. But when I became a man, I caused to cease the things of the infant.
For now we see through a mirror in dimness, but then face to face. Now I know in part, but then I will fully know even as I also was fully known.
And now faith, hope, and love, these three things remain; but the greatest of these is love.

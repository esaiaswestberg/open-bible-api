But concerning the sacrifices to idols, we know that we all have knowledge. Knowledge puffs up, but love builds up.
But if anyone thinks to know anything, he still has known nothing as he ought to know.
But if anyone loves God, he has been known by Him.
Then concerning the eating of things sacrificed to idols, we know that an idol is nothing in the world, and that there is no other God except one.
For even if some are called gods, either in the heavens or on the earth; (even as there are many gods, and many lords);
but to us is one God, the Father, of whom are all things, and we for Him; and one Jesus Christ, through whom are all things, and we by Him.
But the knowledge is not in all; but some being aware of the idol eat as an idolatrous sacrifice until now; and their conscience being weak is defiled.
But food will not commend us to God. For neither if we eat do we excel, nor if we do not eat are we behind.
But be careful lest this authority of yours become a cause of stumbling to the weak ones.
For if anyone sees you, the one having knowledge, sitting in an idol-temple, will not the weak one's conscience be lifted up so as to eat things sacrificed to idols?
And on your knowledge the weak brother will fall, he for whom Christ died.
And sinning in this way against your brothers, and wounding their conscience, being weak, you sin against Christ.
On account of this, if food offends my brother, I will not at all eat flesh forever, so that I do not offend my brother.

Oh that You would tear the heavens and come down, that mountains would quake before You.
As the brushwood fire burns and fire causes water to boil, make known Your name to Your foes, that nations might tremble before You.
When You did terrifying things which we did not look for, You came down; mountains flowed down before You.
And from forever they have not heard; they did not give ear. Eye has not seen a God except You, who works for him who waits for Him.
You meet him who rejoices and works righteousness; they recall You in Your ways. Behold, You were angry, for we sinned. In I them is eternity, we shall be saved.
But we are all as the unclean thing , and all our righteousnesses are as a menstruous cloth. And we all fade as a leaf, and like the wind our iniquities take us away.
And there is not one who calls on Your name, who stirs himself up to take hold of You. For You have hidden Your face from us, and have melted us away into the hand of our iniquities.
But now, Jehovah, You are our Father. We are the clay, and You are our Former; yea, we all are Your handiwork.
Do not be extremely angry, Jehovah, and do not remember iniquity forever. Behold! look, please; all of us are Your people.
Your holy cities are a wilderness; Zion is a wilderness; Jerusalem is a desolation.
The house of our holiness and our beauty where our fathers praised You has become a burning of fire, and all our pleasant things have become a ruin.
Will You restrain Yourself over these things , Jehovah? Will you be silent and sorely afflict us?

For so says the Lord Jehovah: My people went down to Egypt at the first, to reside there, and without cause Assyria oppressed him.

How beautiful on the mountains are the feet of him bringing good news, making peace heard, bringing good news, proclaiming salvation; saying to Zion, Your God reigns!

For you shall not go out with haste, nor will you go by flight; for Jehovah is going before you, and the God of Israel gathers you.
Behold, My Servant shall rule wisely; He shall be exalted and lifted up and be very high.
Just as many were astonished over You, so much was the disfigurement from man, His appearance and His form from sons of mankind.
so He sprinkles from many nations. At Him kings shall shut their mouths; for they will see that which was not told to them; yea, what they had not heard, they will understand.

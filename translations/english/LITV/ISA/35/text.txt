The wilderness and dry land shall rejoice for them; and the desert shall exult and bloom like the crocus.
Blooming, it shall bloom and exult, even with joy and singing. Lebanon's glory shall be given to it, the honor of Carmel and Sharon; they shall see the glory of Jehovah, the majesty of our God.
Make the weak hands strong, and firm up the feeble knees.
Say to those of a hasty heart, Be strong! Do not fear! Behold, your God will come with vengeance; with the full dealing of God, He will come and save you.
Then the eyes of the blind shall be opened, and the ears of the deaf opened.
Then the lame shall leap like a deer, and the tongue of the dumb shall sing. For waters shall break out in the wilderness, and streams in the desert.
And the mirage shall become a pool, and the thirsty land shall become springs of waters, in the home of jackals, in its lair, and a place for the reed and rush.
And a highway shall be there, and a way, and it shall be called, The Way of Holiness. The unclean shall not pass over it. And it is for them, the wayfaring one; yea, fools shall not go astray.
No lion shall be there; and no violent beast shall go up on it; it shall not be found there. But redeemed ones shall walk there.
And the ransomed of Jehovah shall return and enter Zion, with singing and everlasting joy on their head; gladness and joy shall reach them ; and sorrow and sighing shall flee.

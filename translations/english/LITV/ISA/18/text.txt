Woe to the land of whirring of wings, which is beyond the rivers of Ethiopia;
which sends envoys by the sea, even in ships of papyrus on the face of the waters. Go, swift messengers, to a nation tall and smooth, to a dreadful people from it and onwards; and a nation mighty and trampling down, whose land the rivers have divided!
All you inhabitants of the world and dwellers of the earth, as one lifts a banner on the peaks, you will see. And you will hear as the blowing of a ram's horn.
For so Jehovah said to me, I will rest, and I will watch My dwelling place; as the glowing heat on light; as the cloud of dew in the heat of harvest.
For before the harvest, when the bud is perfect, and the sour grape is ripening in the flower, then He will cut off the sprigs with pruning hooks, and cut down and take away the branches.
They shall be left together to the birds of the hills, and to the beasts of the earth. And the birds shall summer on them, and all the beasts of the earth shall winter on them.
Then shall be brought in that time to Jehovah of Hosts a present from a tall and smooth people, and a terrifying people, from it and onward; a mighty and trampling nation whose land the rivers have divided, to the place of the name of Jehovah of Hosts: Mount Zion.

O Jehovah, You are my God. I will exalt You; I will thank Your name; for You have done a wonderful thing: counsels from afar; faithful faithfulness.
Because You have made a heap from a city, a fortified city into a ruin; a citadel of foreigners not to be a city, not to be built, to forever.
For this the mighty people glorify You, the city of the ruthless nations shall fear You.
For You are a stronghold to the poor, a stronghold to the needy in his distress, a refuge from storm, a shadow from heat; because the breath of the ruthless is like a storm against a wall.
You shall lay low the noise of foreigners, like the heat in a dry place, the heat with the shadow of cloud; the shouting of the terrifying ones shall be laid low.
And Jehovah of Hosts shall make a feast of fat things for all the peoples in this mountain; a feast of wine on the lees, of fat things full of marrow, refined wine on the lees.
And He will destroy in this mountain the face of the covering which covers all people, and the veil that is woven over all nations.
He will swallow up death in victory! And the Lord Jehovah will wipe away tears from all faces. And He shall reprove the reproach of His people from all the earth; for Jehovah has spoken
And one shall say in that day, Behold, this is our God; we have waited for Him, and He will save us. This is Jehovah; we have waited for Him; we will be glad and rejoice in His salvation.
For the hand of Jehovah shall rest in this mountain; and Moab shall be trampled under Him, even as straw is trampled in the water of a dung pit.
And He shall spread His hands in his midst, as he who swims strokes to swim. And He shall lay low his pride with the skill of His hands.
And He shall bow down the fortress of the height of your walls; He will lay low, touch to the earth, even to the dust.

The burden of Moab: Because in a night Ar of Moab is laid waste; it is cut off; because in a night Kir of Moab is laid waste; it is cut off.
One goes up to the house, even to Dibon, the high places, to weep. Moab shall howl over Nebo and over Medeba; all its heads shall be bald, every beard shorn.
They shall dress with sackcloth in the streets; everyone shall howl on their housetops and in their plazas, melting in tears.
And Heshbon and Elealeh shall cry; their voice shall be heard as far as Jahaz; so the warriors of Moab shall shout; his life is broken to him.
My heart shall cry to Moab; her fugitives to Zoar, a heifer of three years; he goes up the ascent of Luhith with weeping, for in the way of Horonaim they shall raise up a cry of ruin.
For Nimrim's waters are desolations; for the hay is dried up; the grass fails; there is not a green thing.
On account of this one made up the remainder, and their store; they shall carry them over the torrent of the willows.
For the cry has gone around Moab's borders; his howling even to Eglaim; and his howling even to the Well of Elim.
For Dimon's waters are full of blood; for I will put more on Dimon, a lion on him who escapes from Moab, and for the remnant of the land.

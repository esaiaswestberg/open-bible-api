In the year that king Uzziah died, then I saw the Lord sitting on a throne, high and lifted up. And His train filled the temple.
Above it stood the seraphs. Each one had six wings; with two he covered his face; and with two he covered his feet; and with two he flew.
And one cried to the other and said, Holy, holy, holy is Jehovah of Hosts; all the earth is full of His glory!
And the doorposts shook from the voice of the one who cried; and the house was filled with smoke.
Then I said, Woe is me! For I am cut off; for I am a man of unclean lips, and I live amongst a people of unclean lips; for my eyes have seen the King, Jehovah of Hosts.
Then one of the seraphs flew to me with a live coal in his hand, snatched with tongs from the altar.
And he touched it on my mouth, and said, See, this has touched your lips; and your iniquity is taken away, and your sin is covered.
And I heard the voice of Jehovah, saying, Whom shall I send, and who will go for Us? Then I said, Behold me. Send me!
And He said, Go and tell this people, Hearing you hear, but do not understand; and seeing you see, but do not know.
Make the heart of this people fat, and make his ears heavy, and shut his eyes, that he not see with his eyes, and hear with his ears, and understand with his heart, and turn back, and one heals him.
Then I said, Until when, O Lord? And He said, Until cities lie desolate without inhabitant, and the houses without man, and the land is laid waste, a desolation;
and until Jehovah has sent mankind far away, and the desolation in the midst of the land is great.
But yet a tenth shall be in it, and it shall return and be consumed like the terebinth and like the oak that in being felled yet has its stump (the holy seed is its stump).

And in that day you shall say, O Jehovah, I will thank You. Though You were angry with me, turn away Your anger and You shall comfort me.
Behold, God is my salvation! I will trust and not be afraid, for my strength and song is Jah Jehovah; yea, He has become my salvation.
And you shall draw waters out of the wells of salvation with joy.
And in that day you shall say, Praise Jehovah! Call on His name; declare His doings among the peoples; make mention that His name is exalted.
Sing to Jehovah, for He has done majestically; this is known in all the earth.
Cry and shout, O dweller of Zion! For great is the Holy One of Israel in your midst.

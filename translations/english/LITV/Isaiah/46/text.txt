Bel has bowed; Nebo stoops; their idols are for the beast, and for the cattle; your things carried are loads; a burden for the weary.
They stoop; they bow together; they are not able to deliver the burden; and their soul has gone into captivity.
Listen to me, O house of Jacob, and all the remnant of the house of Israel; who are borne from the belly, who are lifted from the womb:
Even to old age I am He; and I will bear to gray hair; I made, and I will carry; and I will bear and deliver.
To whom will you compare and make Me equal; yea, compare Me, that we may be alike?
Those who lavish gold out of the bag, and weigh silver on the measuring rod; they hire a refiner and he makes it a god. They fall down; yea, they worship.
They carry it on the shoulder; they bear it and set it in its place, and it stands; it shall not move from its place. Yes, he cries to it, but it does not answer, it does not save him from his distress.
Remember this and be a man; return it on your heart, transgressors.
Remember former things from forever, for I am God, and no one else is God, even none like Me,
declaring the end from the beginning, and from the past those things which were not done, saying, My purpose shall rise; and, I will do all My desire;
calling a bird of prey from the sunrise, the man of My counsel from a far off land. Yes, I have spoken; yes, I will cause it to come; I have formed; yes, I will do it.
Listen to Me, mighty ones of heart who are far from righteousness:
I bring near My righteousness; it shall not be far off, and My salvation shall not wait; I will place salvation in Zion, My glory for Israel.

So says Jehovah, Where is the scroll of your mother's divorce whom I have put away? Or who of My creditors that I have sold you to him? Behold, you were sold for your iniquities, and your mother was put away for your trespasses.
Who knows why I have come, and no one is here ? I called, and not one answered. Is My hand truly cut short from ransom? Or is there not power in Me to deliver? Behold, at My rebuke I dry up the sea; I make rivers a wilderness; their fish stink because of no water, and die in thirst.
I clothe the heavens with blackness, and sackcloth makes their covering.
The Lord Jehovah has given to Me the tongue of taught ones, to know to help the weary with a word. He arouses in the morning; He wakens the ear to Me, to hear as the learned.
The Lord Jehovah has opened My ear and I did not rebel; I did not turn away backwards.
I gave My back to strikers, and My cheeks to pluckers; I did not hide My face from shame and spitting.
And the Lord Jehovah will help Me. On account of this I was not ashamed. On account of this I set My face like flint, and I know that I shall not be ashamed.
My Justifier is near. Who will contend with Me? Let us stand up together; who is master of My judgment? Let him come near to Me.
Behold, the Lord Jehovah will help Me; who is He who will condemn Me? Behold, like a garment they shall wear out; the moth shall eat them.
Who among you fears Jehovah, obeying the voice of His servant, who walks in darkness, and no light is in him? Let him trust in the name of Jehovah, and lean on his God.
Behold, all of you who kindle fire, who are surrounded by sparks; walk in the light of your fire and in the sparks you are burning. This shall be to you from My hand; you shall lie down in pain.

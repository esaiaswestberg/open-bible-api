In that day Jehovah shall visit the sea monster, the darting serpent, with His great and fierce and strong sword; even on the sea monster, the twisting serpent; and He shall slay the monster that is in the sea.
In that day sing to it, A vineyard of desire;
I, Jehovah, keep it; I will water it every moment, that no one punish it; I will guard it night and day.
Fury is not in Me. Who will give Me briers and thorns in the battle? I will step through it; I would burn it at once.
Or will he lay hold of My strength that he may make peace with Me? Let him make peace with Me.
Those who come to Jacob, He shall make take root. Israel shall blossom and bud and fill the face of the world with fruit.
As the striking of His striker, did He strike him? Or as the slaying of His slain, is he slain?
You will contend with her by driving her away, by sending her away. He shall take away by His harsh wind, in the day of the east wind.
By this, then, the iniquity of Jacob will be covered, and this is all the fruit, to take away his sin; when he makes all the stones of the altar as chalkstones that are beaten in pieces; Asherahs and sun pillars shall not rise.
For the fortified city shall be lonely, a forsaken pasture, and left like a wilderness. The calf shall feed there, and he shall lie there, and eat up its branches.
When its boughs dry up, they are broken off. Women shall come and burn them, for it is a people with no understanding. On account of this His Maker shall not pity him, and His Former will not favor him.
And it shall be in that day, Jehovah shall thresh from the channel of the River to the torrent of Egypt; and you shall be gathered one by one, sons of Israel.
And it shall be in that day, the great ram's horn shall be blown; and those perishing in the land of Assyria and the outcasts in the land of Egypt shall come and shall worship Jehovah in the holy mountain in Jerusalem.

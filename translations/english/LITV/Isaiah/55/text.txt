Ho, everyone who thirsts, come to the water; and he who has no silver, come buy grain and eat. Yes, come buy grain, wine and milk without silver and with no price.
Why do you weigh out silver for that which is not bread, and your labor for what never satisfies? Listen carefully to Me and eat the good; and let your soul delight itself in fatness.
Bend your ear and come to Me; hear, and your soul shall live; and I will cut a covenant everlasting with you, the faithful mercies of David.
Behold, I gave Him a Witness to peoples, a Leader and Commander of peoples.
Behold, You shall call a nation You do not know; yea, a nation not knowing You shall run to You, because of Jehovah Your God, and for the Holy One of Israel; for He has glorified You.
Seek Jehovah while He may be found; call on Him while He is near.
Let the wicked forsake his way and the vain man his thoughts; and let him return to Jehovah, and He will have mercy on him; and to our God, for He will abundantly pardon.
For My thoughts are not your thoughts, nor are your ways My ways, says Jehovah.
For as the heavens are high from the earth, so My ways are high from your ways, and My thoughts from your thoughts.
For as the rain and the snow comes down from the heavens and do not return there, except it waters the earth and make it bring forth and bud, and give seed to the sower and bread to the eater,
so shall My word be, which goes out of My mouth; it shall not return to Me void, but it shall accomplish that which I please, and it shall prosper in what I sent it to do!
For you shall go out with joy and be led out with peace. The mountains and the hills shall break out into song before you, and all the trees of the field shall clap the palm.
Instead of the thornbush, the fir tree shall come up; instead of the brier, the myrtle shall come up; and it shall be for a name to Jehovah, for an everlasting sign that shall not be cut off.

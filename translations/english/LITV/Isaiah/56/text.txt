So says Jehovah: Keep justice and do righteousness, for My salvation is near to come, and My righteousness to be revealed.
Blessed is the man who does this, and the son of man who lays hold on it; keeping sabbath, from defiling it; and keeping his hand from doing every evil.
And do not let the son of the foreigner speak, he who joins himself to Jehovah, saying, Jehovah surely separates me from His people; and not do let the eunuch say, Behold, I am a dried tree.
For so says Jehovah to the eunuchs who keep My sabbaths and choose things I am pleased with, and take hold of My covenant:
I, even I will give to them in My house and in My walls a hand and a name better than sons and than daughters; I will give them an everlasting name which shall not be cut off.
And the sons of the alien who join themselves on Jehovah to serve Him, and to love the name of Jehovah, to be His servants, everyone who keeps from defiling the sabbath, and takes hold of My covenant:
even them I will bring to My holy mount and make them joyful in My house of prayer. Their burnt offerings and their sacrifices shall be accepted on My altar, for My house shall be called a house of prayer for all the peoples,
states the Lord Jehovah, who gathers the outcasts of Israel, I will yet gather beside him his gathered ones.
All beasts of the field come to devour, all beasts in the forest!
His watchmen are blind; they all do not know; they are all dumb dogs; they cannot bark, dreaming, lying down, loving to slumber;
yea, dogs greedy of soul; they do not know satisfaction. And they are shepherds; they know not discernment; they all look to their own way, each one for his own gain, from his own end, saying:
Come, and let me bring wine, and let us gulp down fermented drink; and tomorrow shall be as this day, great, exceedingly abundant.

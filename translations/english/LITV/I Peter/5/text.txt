I, a fellow elder, exhort the elders among you, I being also witness of the sufferings of Christ, and being sharer of the glory about to be revealed:
Shepherd the flock of God among you, exercising oversight, not by compulsion, but willingly; nor eagerly for base gain, but readily;
nor as exercising lordship over the ones allotted to you , but becoming examples of the flock.
And at the appearing of the Chief Shepherd, you will receive the never fading crown of glory.
Likewise, younger ones be subject to older ones; and all being subject to one another. Put on humility, because God sets Himself "against proud ones, but He gives grace to humble ones." Prov. 3:34
Then be humbled under the mighty hand of God, that He may exalt you in time;
"casting all your anxiety onto Him," because it matters to Him concerning you. LXX-Psa. 54:23; MT-Psa. 55:22
Be sensible, watch, because your adversary the Devil walks about as a roaring lion seeking someone he may devour;
whom firmly resist in the faith, knowing the same sufferings are being completed in your brotherhood in the world.
Now the God of all grace, the One calling you to His eternal glory in Christ Jesus, you having suffered a little, He Himself will perfect, confirm, strengthen, establish you .
To Him be the glory and the might forever and ever. Amen.
I wrote to you by a few words by way of Silvanus the faithful brother, as I reckon, exhorting and witnessing this to be the true grace of God, in which you stand.
The fellow-elected in Babylon greet you; also Mark my son.
Greet one another with a kiss of love. Peace be to you, all those in Christ Jesus. Amen.

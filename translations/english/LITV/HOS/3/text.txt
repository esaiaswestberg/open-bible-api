And Jehovah said to me, Go again, love a woman loved by a friend, yet an adulteress, according to the love of Jehovah toward the sons of Israel, who turn to other gods, and love raisin cakes of grapes.
So I bought her for myself with fifteen pieces of silver, and for a homer of barley, and a half of barley.
And I said to her, You shall stay with me many days. You shall not be a harlot, nor be to a man; and I also will be for you.
For the sons of Israel shall stay many days with no king and no ruler, and with no sacrifice, and no pillars, and no ephod or teraphim.
Afterward the sons of Israel shall return and seek Jehovah their God and David their king. And they shall fear Jehovah and His goodness in the ends of the days.

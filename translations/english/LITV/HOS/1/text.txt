The word of Jehovah that was to Hosea, the son of Beeri, in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz and Hezekiah, kings of Judah, and in the days of Jeroboam, the son of Joash, king of Israel.
The beginning of the speaking of Jehovah by Hosea. And Jehovah said to Hosea, Go, take to yourself a wife of harlotry, and children of harlotry. For the land has utterly gone lusting away from Jehovah.
And he went and took Gomer, the daughter of Diblaim, who conceived and bore him a son.
And Jehovah said to him, Call his name God Will Sow, for yet in a little while I will call to account the blood of Jezreel on the house of Jehu, and will cause the kingdom of the house of Israel to cease.
And it shall be in that day, I will break the bow of Israel in the valley of Jezreel.
And she conceived again and bore a daughter. And He said to him, Call her name No Mercy, for I will not again still have mercy on the house of Israel; but I will completely take them away.
And I will have mercy on the house of Judah and will save them by Jehovah their God. And I will not save them by bow or by sword, or by battle, by horses, or by horsemen.
And she having weaned No Mercy, she conceived and bore a son.
Then He said, Call his name Not My People, for you are not My people, and I will not be for you.
Yet the number of the sons of Israel shall be as the sand of the sea, which is not measured nor numbered. And it shall be, in the place where it is said to them, You are not My people, it shall be said to them, Sons of the Living God.
And the sons of Judah and the sons of Israel shall be gathered together, and shall set over themselves one head. And they shall go up out of the land; for great shall be the day of Jezreel.

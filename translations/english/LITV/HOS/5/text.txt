Hear this, O priests, and listen, house of Israel. And give ear, house of the king. For the judgment is toward you, because you have been a snare to Mizpah, and a net spread on Tabor.
And revolters have gone deep in slaughtering, and I chasten all of them.
I know Ephraim, and Israel has not hidden from me. For now, O Ephraim, you have fornicated; Israel is defiled.
Their doings will not allow them to turn to their God. For the spirit of fornication is in their midst, and they do not know Jehovah.
And the pride of Israel answers to his face. So Israel and Ephraim shall stumble in their iniquity. Judah shall also stumble with them.
They shall go with their flocks and with their herds to seek Jehovah, but they shall not find; He has withdrawn Himself from them.
They have acted treacherously against Jehovah, for they have brought forth strange sons. Now a new moon shall devour them with their portions.
Blow a horn in Gibeah, a trumpet in Ramah. Cry aloud, Bethaven; after you, O Benjamin.
Ephraim shall be desolate in the day of correction. Among the tribes of Israel, I have made known that which is confirmed.
The rulers of Judah were as movers of a border; I will pour out My wrath on them like water.
Ephraim is oppressed, crushed in judgment; because he was pleased, he walked after the command.
Therefore, I am as a moth to Ephraim, and to the house of Judah as rottenness.
When Ephraim saw his sickness, and Judah his wound, then Ephraim went to Assyria, and sent to king Jareb. Yet he could not heal you, nor did he cure you of your wound.
For I am to Ephraim as the lion, and as the young lion to the house of Judah; I, even I, tear and go; I take away, and no one rescues.
I will go; I will return to My place until they confess their guilt and seek My face. In their affliction they will seek Me diligently.

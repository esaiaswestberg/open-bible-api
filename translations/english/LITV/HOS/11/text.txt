When Israel was a child, then I loved him, and I called My son out of Egypt.
As they called to them, so they went from their face. They sacrifice to the Baals, and burn incense to graven images.
I also taught Ephraim to go; He took them on His arms. But they did not know that I healed them.
I drew them with cords of a man, with bands of love. And I was to them as those who lift off the yoke on their jaws; and I gently give food to him.
He shall not return to the land of Egypt, but he of Assyria shall be his king, because they refused to return.
And the sword shall grieve in his cities, and shall destroy his bars, and shall consume, because of their own counsels.
And My people are bent on backsliding from Me. And they call him to the Most High; no one at all would exalt Him .
How shall I give you up, Ephraim? Shall I deliver you, Israel? How shall I make you like Admah? Shall I set you as Zeboim? My heart has turned within Me; My compassions are kindled together.
I will not carry out the heat of My anger; I will not return to destroy Ephraim. For I am God, and not a man, the Holy One in your midst. And I will not enter into the city.
They shall walk after Jehovah; He shall roar as a lion. When He roars, then sons shall tremble from the west.
They trembled like a bird from Egypt, and like a dove from the land of Assyria. And I will make them live in their houses, says Jehovah.
Ephraim circles around Me with lies, and the house of Israel with deceit; but Judah still rules with God and is faithful with the saints.

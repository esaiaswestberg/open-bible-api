In that day a fountain shall be opened to the house of David and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, for sin and for impurity.
And it shall be in that day, I will cut off the names of the idols out of the land, and they shall be remembered no more, says Jehovah of hosts. And I also will cause the prophets and the unclean spirit to pass out of the land.
And it shall be when any shall prophesy again, his father and his mother who gave him birth shall say to him then, You shall not live, for you speak lies in the name of Jehovah. And his father and his mother who gave him birth shall pierce him when he prophesies.
And it shall be in that day, the prophets shall be ashamed, each one of his vision when he prophesies, and they shall not wear a hairy garment to deceive.
But he shall say, I am not a prophet; I am a man, a tiller of the ground, for a man caused me to buy from my youth.
And one shall say to him, What are these wounds between your hands? Then he shall answer, Those with which I was struck in the house of those who love me.
O sword, awake against My Shepherd, and against the Man who is My companion, says Jehovah of hosts. Strike the Shepherd and the sheep will be scattered. And I will turn My hand against the little ones.
And it shall be in all the land, says Jehovah, two parts in it shall be cut off and perish, but the third shall be left in it.
And I will bring the third part through the fire, and I will refine them as silver is refined. And I will try them as gold is tried. They shall call on My name, and I will answer them. I will say, It is My people, and they shall say, Jehovah is my God.

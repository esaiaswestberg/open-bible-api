And the angel who was speaking with me returned and awakened me, as a man is awakened out of his sleep.
And he said to me, What do you see? And I said, I see, and behold, a lampstand, all of it gold, and a bowl on its top, and its seven lamps on it, and seven spouts each to the seven lamps on its top;
and two olive trees are beside it, one on the right of the bowl, and one on its left.
And I answered and spoke to the angel who was talking with me, saying, What are these, my lord?
And the angel who was speaking with me answered and said to me, Do you not know what these are ? And I said, No, my lord.
Then he answered and spoke to me, saying, This is the word of Jehovah to Zerubbabel, saying, Not by might, nor by power, but by My Spirit, says Jehovah of hosts.
Who are you, O great mountain? Before Zerubbabel you shall become a plain. And he shall bring forth the capstone with shouts: Grace! Grace to it!
And the word of Jehovah was to me, saying,
The hands of Zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this house; his hands shall also finish it . And you shall know that Jehovah of hosts has sent me to you.
For who has despised the day of small things? For they shall rejoice and shall see the plummet stone in the hand of Zerubbabel. These seven are the eyes of Jehovah; they run to and fro through all the earth.
And I answered and said to him, What are these two olive trees on the right of the lampstand, and on its left?
And I answered a second time and said to him, What are the two clusters of olives beside the two golden pipes, emptying the golden oil from themselves?
And he spoke to me, saying, Do you not know what these are ? And I said, No, my lord.
And he said, These are the two sons of fresh oil who stand by the Lord of the whole earth.

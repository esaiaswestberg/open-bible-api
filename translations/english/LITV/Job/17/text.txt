My spirit is broken; my days are extinct; graves are for me.
Are not mockeries with me? And my eye rests on their insults.
Please lay down a pledge for me with Yourself; who is he who will strike my hand with me?
For You have hidden their heart from understanding; therefore You shall not exalt them .
He informs against friends for a share; even his son's eyes shall be consumed.
He has also set me as a byword of the peoples, and I am a spitting to the faces.
And my eye is dim from grief; and all my members are like a shadow.
Upright ones shall be amazed at this; and the innocent shall stir himself against the ungodly.
And the righteous shall hold firmly on his way; and he of clean hands adds strength.
And now all of them, go back and please come again; and I shall not find among you a wise man.
My days have passed; my plans are broken off, the desires of my heart.
They set night for day; light is near in the face of darkness.
If I wait for Sheol as my house, I have spread out my bed in the darkness;
I have said to corruption, You are my father; to the worm, My mother and my sister.
And where then is my hope? And as for my hope, who shall see it?
They shall go down to the bars of Sheol, when our descent together is in the dust.

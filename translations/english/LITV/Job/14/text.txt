Man born of woman is short of days, and full of turmoil.
He comes forth like a flower, and withers; he also flees as a shadow, and does not stand.
Also do You open Your eyes on such a one, and bring me into judgment with You?
Who gives a clean thing out of an unclean? No one!
Since his days are fixed, the number of his months is with You, and You have appointed his hounds, and he cannot pass over;
look away from him, so that he may rest, till he shall enjoy his day as a hireling.
For there is hope of a tree, if it is cut down, that it will sprout again, and its shoot will not cease.
Though its root becomes old in the earth, and its stump dies in the dust,
at the scent of water it will bud, and bring forth branches like a plant.
But man dies and is cut off, and man expires; and where is he?
As the waters go away from the sea, and a river wastes away and dries up,
Even so man lies down and does not rise until the heavens are no more, they shall not awake, nor be roused out of their sleep.
Who will grant that You would hide me in Sheol; You would conceal me until Your anger turns back; that You would set a limit for me and remember me?
If a man dies, will he revive? All the days of my warfare I will wait, until my change comes.
You shall call, and I will answer You; You shall long to the work of Your hands.
For now You number my steps; do You not watch over my sin?
My transgression is sealed up in a bag, and You cover over my iniquity.
And surely a falling mountain crumbles away, and the rock moves out of its place.
The waters wear away stones; its outpouring washes the dust of the earth; and You cause the hope of man to perish.
You overpower him forever, and He goes. You change his face and send him away.
His sons come to honor, and he does not know; they fail, but he does not mark it.
But his flesh is pained within him; and his soul mourns over him.

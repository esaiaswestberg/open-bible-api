And Zophar the Naamathite answered and said:
Should not a flood of words be answered? And should a man of lips be justified?
Should your lies make men silent? And will you mock, and no one make you ashamed?
For you have said, My doctrine is pure; and, I am clean in Your eyes.
But who will grant that God would speak and open His lips against you,
and would tell you the secrets of wisdom, that counsel is double? Know then that God forgets some of your iniquity for you.
Can you find out God by searching? Or can you find out the end of the Almighty?
Heights of the heavens! What can you do? It is deeper than Sheol; what can you know?
Its measure is longer than the earth, broader than the sea.
If He passes through and shuts up, or gathers together, then who can turn Him back?
For He knows the vanity of men; and He sees deceit, and will He not consider?
For foolish man takes heart, and man is born a wild ass's colt.
If you prepare your heart, and stretch out your hands toward Him;
if iniquity is in your hand, put it far away and do not let wickedness dwell in your tents;
surely then you shall lift up your face without blemish; and you will be steadfast, and you will not fear;
for you shall forget your misery, and shall remember it as waters that have passed;
and your lifetime shall rise more than the noonday; you shall fly; you shall be as the morning.
And you shall trust, because there is hope. Yea, you shall look about and you shall lie down in safety.
You shall lie down, and no one will be terrifying; yea, many shall seek your favor.
But the eyes of the wicked shall be consumed, and escape shall perish from them; and their hope shall be like the breathing out of the soul.

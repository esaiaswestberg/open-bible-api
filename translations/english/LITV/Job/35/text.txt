And Elihu answered and said:
Do you think this to be just, you that say, I am more just than God?
For you say, What will it benefit you? What shall I profit more than if I had sinned?
I will answer your words, and your friends with you.
Observe the heavens, and see; and behold the clouds, they are higher than you.
If you sin, what do you do against Him? Or if your transgressions are multiplied, what do you do to Him?
If you are righteous, what do you give to Him? Or what does He receive from your hand?
Your wickedness is for a man like yourself; and your righteousness may profit a son of man.
From the host of tyrannies, they cry out; they cry because of the arm of the multitude.
But no one says, Where is God my Maker, who gives songs in the night,
teaching us more than the animals of the earth, and makes us wiser than the birds of the heavens?
There they cry, but He does not answer, because of the pride of evildoers.
Surely, God will not hear vanity, nor will the Almighty look upon it.
How much less when you say you do not see Him! Judgment is before Him, and you are waiting for Him.
And now, because His anger has not visited, and He does not recognize great stupidity,
even Job vainly opens his mouth; he multiplies words without knowledge.

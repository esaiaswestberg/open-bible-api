And these three men rested from answering Job, because he was righteous in his own eyes.
And burned the wrath of Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite, of the family of Ram; his wrath burned against Job, because he had justified himself rather than God.
Also his wrath burned against his three friends, because they had not found any answer, yet they had condemned Job.
And Elihu had waited for Job with words, because they were older than he in days.
When Elihu saw that there was no answer in the mouth of the three men, then his anger burned.
And Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite answered and said, I am young, and you are very aged; so I held back and was afraid to make my knowledge known to you.
I said, Days will speak, and many years will make wisdom known.
But it is a spirit in man giving them perception, even the breath of the Almighty.
It is not the great that are wise, nor the aged who perceive justice;
so then I say, Listen to me; I will declare my knowledge, I also.
Behold, I waited for your words; I listened to your reasons while you searched out words;
yea, I paid attention to you, and behold, not one of you proved Job wrong, nor answered his sayings;
that you not say, We have discovered wisdom. It is God who will scatter him, not man.
And he has not ordered words against me, and I will not answer him with your words.
They are broken; they do not reply again; words have departed from them.
Shall I wait because they do not speak, because they stand, not answering again?
I also will answer my share; I also will declare my knowledge.
For I am full of words; the spirit inside me pressed on me;
behold my breast is like wine that has no vent; it bursts like new wineskins.
I will speak so that I may be relieved; I will open my lips and answer.
I will not now lift up the face of a man, nor eulogize any man.
for I do not know how to eulogize; else after a little my Maker will take me away.

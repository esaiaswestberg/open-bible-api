In many parts and in many ways of old, God spoke to the fathers in the prophets;
in these last days He spoke to us in the Son, whom He appointed heir of all; through whom He indeed made the ages;
who being the shining splendor of His glory, and the express image of His essence, and upholding all things by the word of His power, having made purification of our sins through Himself, He sat down on the right of the Majesty on high, Psa. 110:1
having become so much better than the angels, He has inherited a name more excellent than they.
For to which of the angels did He ever say, "You are My Son; today I have begotten You"? And again, "I will be a Father to Him, and He shall be a Son to Me." Psa. 2:7; 2 Sam. 7:16
And again, when He brought the First-born into the world, He said, "And let all the angels of God worship Him." LXX-Deut. 32:43, MT-No Equiv
And as to the angels, He said, "Who makes His angels spirits, and His ministers a flame of fire;" LXX-Psa. 103:4; MT-Psa. 104:4
but as to the Son, "Your throne, O God, is forever and ever, A scepter of righteousness is the scepter of Your kingdom;
You have loved righteousness and hated lawlessness; because of this God, Your God, has anointed You with the oil of gladness beside Your fellows." Psa. 45:6, 7
And, "You, Lord, at the beginning founded the earth, and the heavens are works of Your hands.
They will vanish away, but You will continue; and they will all become old, like a garment,
and You shall fold them up like a covering, and they shall be changed. But You are the same, and Your years shall not fail." LXX-Psa. 101:26-28, MT-Psa. 102:25-27
But to which of the angels did He ever say, "Sit at My right hand until I place Your enemies as a footstool of Your feet?" LXX-Psa. 109:1, MT-Psa. 110:1
Are they not all ministering spirits for service, being sent out because of the ones being about to inherit salvation?

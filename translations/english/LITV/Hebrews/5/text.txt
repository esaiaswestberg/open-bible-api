For every high priest being taken from men is appointed on behalf of men in the things respecting God, that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins;
being able to feel in due measure for those not knowing and having been led astray, since he also is circled about with weakness.
And because of this he ought to offer for sins as concerning the people, so also concerning himself.
And no one takes the honor to himself, but he being called by God, even as Aaron also.
So also Christ did not glorify Himself to become a high priest, but He speaking to Him, "You are My Son; today I have begotten You." Psa. 2:7
As He also says in another, "You are a priest forever according to the order of Melchizedek," Psa. 110:4
who in the days of His flesh was offering both petitions and entreaties to Him being able to save Him from death, with strong crying and tears, and being heard from His godly fear;
though being a Son, He learned obedience from what He suffered
and being perfected, He became the Author of eternal salvation to all the ones obeying Him,
having been called out by God as a High Priest according to the order of Melchizedek.
Concerning whom we have much to say, and hard to interpret since you have become dull in hearing.
For indeed because of the time you are due to be teachers, yet you need to have someone to teach you again the rudiments of the beginning of the oracles of God, and you have become in need of milk, and not of solid food;
for everyone partaking of milk is without experience in the word of righteousness, for he is an infant.
But solid food is for those full grown, having exercised the faculties through habit, for distinction of both good and bad.

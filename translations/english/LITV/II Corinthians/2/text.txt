But I decided this within myself, not to come to you again in grief.
For if I grieved you, who yet will be making me glad, if not the one being grieved by me?
And I wrote this same thing to you, lest coming I might have grief from those of whom I ought to rejoice, trusting in you all that my joy is the joy of all of you.
For out of much affliction and agony of heart I wrote to you, through many tears, not that you be grieved, but that you know the love which I have more abundantly toward you.
But if anyone has grieved, he has not grieved me, but in part, that I not overbear all of you.
This censure by the majority is enough for such a one.
So that on the contrary, you should rather forgive and comfort such a one, that he not be swallowed up by the overflowing grief.
So I beseech you to confirm your love to him.
For to this end I also wrote, that I might know the proof of you, if you are obedient in all things.
But to whom you forgive anything, I also. For also if I have forgiven anything, of whom I have forgiven it, it is for you, in Christ's person,
so that we should not be overreached by Satan, for we are not ignorant of his devices.
And coming to Troas for the gospel of Christ, and a door having been opened to me in the Lord,
I had no ease in my spirit at my not finding my brother Titus, but saying farewell to them, I went out to Macedonia.
But thanks be to God, He always leading us in triumph in Christ, and the One revealing through us the odor of the knowledge of Him in every place.
For we are a sweet smell to God because of Christ in those being saved, and in those being lost;
to the one, an odor of death unto death, and to the other, an odor of life unto life. And who is sufficient for these things?
For we are not as the many, hawking the Word of God; but as of sincerity, but as of God. We speak in Christ, in the sight of God.

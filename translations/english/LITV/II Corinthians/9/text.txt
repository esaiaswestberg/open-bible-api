For indeed concerning the ministry to the saints, it is unnecessary for me to write to you.
For I know your eagerness, of which I boast to Macedonia on your behalf, that Achaia has made ready from last year, and your zeal arouses the greater number.
But I sent the brothers that our boasting which is on your behalf should not be in vain in this respect, that as I said, you were ready;
lest if Macedonians come with me and find you not ready, that we (we do not say you) should be ashamed in this assurance of boasting.
Therefore, I thought it necessary to exhort the brothers, that they go forward to you and arrange beforehand your promised blessing, this to be ready, thus as a blessing and not as greediness.
And this: the one sowing sparingly will also reap sparingly, and the one sowing on hope of blessings will also reap on blessings.
Each one as he purposes in his heart, not out of grief or out of necessity, for God loves a cheerful giver. Prov. 22:8
And God is able to make all grace to abound toward you, that in everything, always having all self sufficiency, you may abound to every good work;
even as it has been written, "He scattered, he gave to the poor, his righteousness abides forever." Psa. 112:9
Now He that supplies seed to the sower and bread for eating, may He supply and multiply your seed and increase the fruits of your righteousness,
in everything you being enriched to all generosity, which works out thanksgiving to God through us.
Because the ministry of this service is not only making up the things lacking of the saints, but also multiplying through many thanksgivings to God,
through the proof of this service, they glorifying God by your freely expressed submission to the gospel of Christ, and the generosity of the fellowship toward them and toward all;
and in their prayer for you, a longing after you, because of the overflowing grace of God on you.
But thanks be to God for His unspeakable free gift.

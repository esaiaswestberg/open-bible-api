Send out your bread on the face of the waters, for you shall find it in many days.
Give a share to seven, or even to eight; for you do not know what evil may be on the earth.
If the clouds are full of rain, they empty on the earth. And if the tree falls in the south, or in the north, in the place where the tree falls, there it shall be.
He who watches the wind shall not sow. And he who looks at the clouds shall not reap.
As you do not know what is the way of the wind, as the bones in the pregnant woman's womb, even so you do not know the works of God who makes all.
Sow your seed in the morning, and do not rest your hand until evening; for you do not know what shall be blessed, this or that; or whether they both shall be good as one.
Also the light is sweet; yea, it is good for the eyes to behold the sun.
But if the man lives many years, let him rejoice in them all, and remember the days of darkness, for they shall be many. All that may come is vanity.
Rejoice, O young man, in your youth. And make your heart glad in the days of your youth, and walk in the ways of your heart, and in the sight of your eyes; but know that for all these things God will bring you into judgment.
So then remove vexation from your heart, and put away evil from your flesh. For childhood and prime of life are vanity.

And the word of Jehovah came to me, saying,
Son of man, how is the vine tree more than any other tree, or than a branch that is among the trees of the forest?
Shall wood be taken from it to do work? Or will men take from it for a peg to hang every vessel on it?
Behold, it is put in the fire for fuel. The fire devours both its ends, and its middle is charred. Will it prosper for work?
Behold, when it was whole it was not made for work. How much less when the fire has devoured it, and it is charred! Shall it yet be made to work?
Therefore, so says the Lord Jehovah: As the vine tree among the trees of the forest, it which I have given to the fire for fuel, so I will give the dwellers of Jerusalem.
And I will set my face against them. They shall go out from the fire, and the fire shall devour them. And you shall know that I am Jehovah when I set My face against them.
And I will give the land to be desolate because they have done a treacherous act, declares the Lord Jehovah.

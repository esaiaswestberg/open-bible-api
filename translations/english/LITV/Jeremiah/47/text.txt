The word of Jehovah that was to Jeremiah the prophet against the Philistines, before Pharaoh struck Gaza.
So says Jehovah, Behold, waters rise up out of the north and shall become an overflowing torrent. And it shall overflow the land and all its fullness; the city, and those who dwell in it. Then the men shall cry, and all the people of the land shall wail.
At the noise of the stamping of the hooves of his strong horses , at the rushing of his chariots, the rumbling of his wheels, the fathers shall not look back to their sons, because of feebleness of hands;
because of the day that comes to destroy all the Philistines, to cut off from Tyre and Sidon every survivor who helps. For Jehovah will plunder the Philistines, the rest of the coast of Caphtor.
Baldness has come on Gaza; Ashkelon is ruined. O remnant of their valley, until when will you cut off yourself?
O sword of Jehovah, until when will you not be quiet? Put yourself into your sheath; rest, and be still.
How can you be quiet, since Jehovah has given it a command? He has set it there against Ashkelon, and against the seashore.

The word that Jeremiah the prophet spoke to Baruch, the son of Neriah, when he had written these words in a writing from the mouth of Jeremiah, in the fourth year of Jehoiakim, the son of Josiah, king of Judah, saying,
So says Jehovah, the God of Israel, to you, O Baruch:
You said, Woe is me now, for Jehovah has added grief to my pain; I fainted in my sighing, and I find no rest.
So you shall say to him, Jehovah says this: Behold, I am tearing down what I have built; and I am pulling up what I have planted, even all the land itself to Me.
And do you seek great things for yourself? Do not seek them . For, behold, I will bring evil on all flesh, declares Jehovah. But I will give your soul to you for a prize, there on all the places where you go.

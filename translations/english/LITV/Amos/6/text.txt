Woe to those at ease in Zion, and those trusting in the mountain of Samaria, those noted as the leader of the nations! And the house of Israel came to them.
Cross to Calneh and see; and from there go to the great Hamath; then go down to Gath of the Philistines. Are they better than these kingdoms, or their border than your border?
You who put the evil day far away, and cause the seat of violence to come near,
who lie on beds of ivory and stretch themselves on their couches; and those eating the lambs from the flock, and bull calves from the midst of the stall;
those chanting with the mouth of the harp; they invent instruments of song for themselves like David;
who drink bowls of wine, and they anoint with the best of oils; but they are not grieved for the breaking of Joseph!
So now they shall go into exile with the first of the exiles, and the feast of those who stretch themselves shall cease.
The Lord Jehovah has sworn by Himself, declares Jehovah, the God of hosts: I abhor the pride of Jacob, and hate his palaces; and I will shut up the city and its fullness.
And it shall be, if ten men remain in one house, then they shall die.
And his uncle shall lift him up, and he who burns him, to bring out the bones from the house; and he shall say to that one left in the recesses of the house, Are any still with you? And he shall say, No. Then he shall say, Hush! For not one shall mention the name of Jehovah.
For, behold, Jehovah commands, and He will strike the great house into pieces, and the little house into cracks.
Shall horses run on the rock? Or will one plow there with oxen? For you have turned justice into poison, and the fruit of righteousness into wormwood,
those rejoicing for nothing, those saying, Have we not taken horns to ourselves by our own strength?
For, behold, I will raise a nation up against you, O house of Israel, declares Jehovah, the God of hosts. And they shall oppress you from the entrance of Hamath to the torrent of the Arabah.

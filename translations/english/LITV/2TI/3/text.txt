But know this, that in the last days grievous times will be upon us .
For men will be lovers of themselves, lovers of money, braggarts, arrogant, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy,
without natural feeling, unyielding, slanderers, without self-control, savage, haters of good,
betrayers, reckless, puffed up, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God,
having a form of godliness, but denying the power of it; even turn away from these.

But you have closely followed my doctrine, the conduct, the purpose, the faith, the long-suffering, the love, the patient endurance,

But evil men and pretenders will go forward to worse, leading astray and being led astray.
But you keep on in what you learned and were assured of, knowing from whom you learned,
and that from a babe you know the Holy Scriptures, those being able to make you wise to salvation through belief in Christ Jesus.
Every Scripture is God-breathed and profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness,
so that the man of God may be perfected, fully furnished for every good work.

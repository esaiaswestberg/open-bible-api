And Hiram the king of Tyre sent messengers to David, and cedar trees, and masons, and carpenters, to build a house for him.
And David saw that Jehovah had established him king over Israel, for his kingdom was exalted to a height, for the sake of His people Israel.
And David again took wives in Jerusalem. And David again fathered sons and daughters.
And these were the names of the children who were to him in Jerusalem: Shammua, and Shobab, Nathan, and Solomon,
and Ibhar, and Elishua, and Elpalet,
and Nogah, and Nepheg, and Japhia,
and Elishama, and Beeliada, and Eliphalet.
And the Philistines heard that David had been anointed king over all Israel. And all the Philistines went up to seek David. And David heard, and went out before them.
And the Philistines came and made a raid in the Valley of the Giants.
And David asked of God, saying, Shall I go up against the Philistines; and, Have You given them into my hand? And Jehovah said to him, Go up, and I will give them into your hand.
And they went up to Baal-perazim, and David struck them there. And David said, God has broken my enemies by my hand, like the breaking of the waters; so they called the name of that place Baal-perazim.
And they left their gods there. And David commanded, and they were burned with fire.
And yet again the Philistines raided in the valley.
And David again inquired of God. And God spoke to him, You shall not go up after them; turn away from them and come to them across from the weeping trees.
And it shall be, when you hear the sound of marching in the tops of the weeping trees, then you shall go out in the battle; for God has gone out before you to strike the army of the Philistines.
And David did as God commanded him. And they struck the army of the Philistines from Gibeon even to Gezer.
And the name of David went out into all the lands; and Jehovah put the dread of him on all the nations.

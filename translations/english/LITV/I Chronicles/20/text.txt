And it happened, at the time of the return of the year, at the time when kings go forth, that Joab led out the power of the army and wasted the country of the Ammonites and came and besieged Rabbah. But David remained at Jerusalem. And Joab struck Rabbah and overthrew it.
And David took the crown of their king from his head, and found it a talent of gold in weight, and a precious stone in it; and it was set on David's head. And he also brought out the plunder of the city, a very great amount.
And he brought out the people in it; and they sawed with saws, and with sharp tools of iron, and with the axes. And so David did to all the cities of the Ammonites. And David and all the people returned to Jerusalem.
And it happened after this, that there stood a battle again with the Philistines in Gezer; then Sibbechai the Hushathite killed Sippai of the children of the giant, and they were humbled.
And there was a battle again with the Philistines; and Elhanan the son of Jair killed Lahmi, the brother of Goliath the Gittite the wood of whose spear was like the weavers' beam.
And there was a battle again in Gath; and a man of stature was there, and his fingers and toes were six and six, twenty four; and also he had been born to the giant.
And he cursed Israel. And Jonathan the son of Shimea, the brother of David, killed him.
These were born to the giant in Gath, and they fell by the hand of David, and by the hand of his servants.

And Miriam and Aaron spoke against Moses, because of the Cushite woman whom he had taken. For he had taken a Cushite woman.
And they said, Has Jehovah spoken only by Moses? Has He not also spoken by us? And Jehovah heard.
And the man Moses was very meek, more than any man who was on the face of the earth.
And Jehovah said suddenly to Moses, and to Aaron, and to Miriam, You three come out to the tabernacle of the congregation. And the three of them came out.
And Jehovah came down in the pillar of the cloud and stood at the tabernacle door, and called Aaron and Miriam. And both of them came out.
And He said, Now hear My words, If your prophet is of Jehovah, I shall make Myself known to him in an appearance; I will speak to him in a dream.
It is not so with My servant Moses! He is faithful in all My house.
I speak to him mouth to mouth, and by an appearance, and not in riddles; and he carefully looks upon the form of Jehovah. So why have you not been afraid to speak against My servant, against Moses?
And the anger of Jehovah glowed against them, and He left.
And the cloud turned away from the tent. And, behold Miriam was leprous as snow! And Aaron turned toward Miriam, and, behold, she was leprous!
And Aaron said to Moses, Oh my lord, I beg you, do not lay sin upon us, by which we have done foolishly, and by which we have sinned.
I beg you, do not let her be as one dead, of whom the flesh is half consumed when he comes out of his mother's womb.
And Moses cried to Jehovah, saying, O God, I beg You, give healing to her, I beseech You.
And Jehovah said to Moses, If her father had but spat in her face, should she not be ashamed seven days? She shall be shut out seven days at the outside of the camp, and afterward she shall be brought in.
And Miriam was shut out at the outside of the camp seven days, and the people did not pull up stakes until Miriam was brought in.
And afterward the people pulled up from Hazeroth, and they encamped in the wilderness of Paran.

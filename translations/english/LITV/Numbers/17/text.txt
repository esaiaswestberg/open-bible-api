And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,
Speak to the sons of Israel, and take from each of them a rod, for a father's house, from all their rulers, for the house of their fathers, twelve rods. You shall write the name of each on his rod.
And you shall write Aaron's name on the staff of the tribe of Levi; for one rod shall be for the head of their fathers' house.
And you shall place them in the tabernacle of the congregation, before the testimony, where I shall meet with you.
And it shall be that the man's rod which I choose shall blossom. And I shall cause the murmurings of the sons of Israel, which they are murmuring against you, to cease from Me.
And Moses spoke to the sons of Israel, and all their rulers gave to him one rod for each ruler, one rod for a ruler, for their fathers' house, twelve rods, and the rod of Aaron was among the rods.
And Moses placed the rods before Jehovah, in the tabernacle of the testimony.
And it happened on the next day, Moses went into the tabernacle of the testimony, and, behold! The rod of Aaron for the house of Levi had budded, and put forth buds, and bloomed blossoms, and bore ripe almonds.
And Moses brought out all the rods from before Jehovah to all the sons of Israel. And they looked, and each one took his rod.
And Jehovah said to Moses, Put back the rod of Aaron, before the testimony, to be kept as a token to the sons of rebellion. And you shall end their murmurings off Me; and they shall not die.
And Moses did as Jehovah had commanded him; so he did.
And the sons of Israel spoke to Moses, saying, Behold, we die. we perish, we all perish.
Anyone who draws near to the tabernacle of Jehovah shall die; shall we be consumed to die?

First of all then, I exhort that petitions, prayers, intercessions, and thanksgivings be made on behalf of all men,
for kings and all the ones being in high position, that we may lead a tranquil and quiet existence in all godliness and dignity.
For this is good and acceptable before God our deliverer,
who desires all men to be delivered and to come to a full knowledge of truth.
For God is one, also there is one Mediator of God and of men, the Man Christ Jesus,
the One having given Himself a ransom on behalf of all, the testimony to be given in its own times,
to which I was appointed a herald and apostle (I speak the truth in Christ, I do not lie), a teacher of the nations, in faith and truth.
Therefore, I desire the men to pray in every place, lifting up holy hands without wrath and doubting.
So also the women to adorn themselves in proper clothing, with modesty and sensibleness, not with plaiting, or gold, or pearls, or expensive garments,
but what becomes women professing fear of God, through good works.
Let a woman learn in silence, in all subjection.
And I do not allow a woman to teach nor to exercise authority over a man, but to be in silence.
For Adam was formed first, then Eve.
And Adam was not deceived, but the woman being deceived has come to be in transgression;
but she will be kept safe through the childbearing, if they continue in faith and love and holiness, with sensibleness.

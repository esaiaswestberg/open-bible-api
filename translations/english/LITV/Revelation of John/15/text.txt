And I saw another sign in Heaven, great and marvelous: seven angels having the last seven plagues, because the anger of God was completed in them.
And I saw, as a glassy sea having been mixed with fire. And the ones overcoming the beast, and its image, and its mark, of the number of its name, were standing on the glassy sea, having harps of God.
And they sing the song of Moses the slave of God, and the song of the Lamb, saying, Great and marvelous are Your works, Lord God Almighty, righteous and true are Your ways, King of the saints.
Who will not fear You, Lord, and glorify Your name? For You only are holy. For all the nations will come and will worship before You, because Your righteousnesses were made known.
And after these things I saw; and behold, the temple of the tabernacle of the testimony in Heaven was opened!
And the seven angels having the seven plagues came forth out of the temple, having been clothed in clean and bright linen, and golden bands having been girded around the breasts.
And one of the four living creatures gave to the seven angels seven golden bowls filled with the anger of God living forever and ever.
And the temple was filled with the smoke of the glory of God, and with His power. And no one was able to enter into the temple until the seven plagues of the seven angels should be completed.

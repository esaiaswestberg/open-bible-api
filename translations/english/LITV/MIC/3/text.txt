And I said, Heads of Jacob and magistrates of the house of Israel, please hear. Is it not for you to know justice?
Those hating good and loving evil, who pull their skin off them, and their flesh from their bones;
who also eat the flesh of My people, and cause their skin to come off from them; yea, they break their bones and shatter, like that in the pot, and as flesh in the midst of the kettle.
Then they shall cry out to Jehovah, but He will not answer them. He will even hide His face from them in that time, as they have done evil in their doings.
So says Jehovah concerning the prophets who make My people err, who bite with their teeth and call out, Peace! And whoever does not give for their mouth, they even sanctify a war against him.
So a night shall be for you apart from vision; and darkness apart from divining. And the sun shall go down on the prophets, and the day shall be dark over them.
And the seers shall be ashamed, and the diviners shall blush, all of them; yea, they shall cover over their mustache, for there is no answer from God.
But by the Spirit of Jehovah I am full of power and justice and might, to declare to Jacob his transgression, and his sin to Israel.
Please hear this, heads of the house of Jacob, and magistrates of the house of Israel, you who abhor justice and pervert all equity.
those building up Zion with blood and Jerusalem with iniquity:
Her leaders judge for a bribe, and her priests teach for pay, and her prophets divine for silver; yet they will lean on Jehovah, saying, is not Jehovah among us? No evil shall come on us!
Therefore, on account of you, Zion shall be plowed as a field, and Jerusalem shall become heaps, and the mountain of the house into high places of the forest.

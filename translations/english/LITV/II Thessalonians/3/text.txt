For the rest, brothers, pray concerning us, that the Word of the Lord may run and be glorified, even as also it has with you,
and that we may be delivered from perverse and evil men. For faith is not in all.
But the Lord is faithful who will establish and will guard you from the evil.
But we are persuaded in the Lord as to you, that whatever things we have commanded you, you both do and you will do.
And the Lord direct your hearts into the love of God and into the patience of Christ.
And we charge you, brothers, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, to draw yourselves back from every brother walking in a disorderly way, and not according to the teaching which you received from us.
For you yourselves know how it is right to act like us, because we were not disorderly among you;
nor did we eat bread from anyone as a gift, but by labor and toil, working night and day in order not to burden anyone of you.
Not that we do not have authority, but that we give ourselves as an example to you, for you to act like us.
For even when we were with you, we commanded this to you: If anyone does not desire to work, neither let him eat.
For we hear some are walking in a disorderly way among you, not working at all, but being busybodies.
And we command such and exhort through our Lord Jesus Christ that working with quietness, they may eat their own bread.
And you, brothers, do not lose heart in well doing.
But if anyone does not obey our word through the letter, mark that one, and do not associate with him, that he be shamed.
But do not count him an enemy, but warn him as a brother.
And may the Lord of peace Himself continually give peace to you in every way. The Lord be with all of you.
The greeting of Paul by my hand is the sign in every letter; so I write.
The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.

But working together, we also call on you not to receive the grace of God in vain.
(For He says, "In an acceptable time I heard you, and in a day of salvation, I helped you;" Behold, now is the accepted time. Behold, now is the day of salvation.)
We are in nothing giving cause of stumbling, in no way, so that the ministry may not be blamed,
but in everything commending ourselves as God's servants, in much patience, in troubles, in emergencies, in distresses,
in stripes, in imprisonments, in riots, in labors, in watchings, in fastings;
in pureness, in knowledge, in long-suffering, in kindness, in the Holy Spirit, in love unfeigned,
in the word of truth, in the power of God, through the weapons of righteousness on the right hand and on the left,
through glory and dishonor, through evil report and good report; as deceivers and yet true;
as unknown and yet well known; as dying and, behold, we live; as chastened and not killed;
as sorrowful, yet always rejoicing; as poor, yet making many rich; as having nothing, yet possessing all things.
O Corinthians, our mouth is opened to you, our heart has been enlarged.
You are not restrained in us, but you are restrained in your own affections.
But for the same reward, (I speak as to children), you also be enlarged.
Do not be unequally yoked together with unbelievers; for what fellowship does righteousness have with lawlessness? And what partnership does light have with darkness?
And what agreement does Christ have with Belial? Or what part does a believer have with an unbeliever?
And what agreement does a temple of God have with idols? For you are the temple of the living God, as God has said, "I will dwell in them and walk among them; and I will be their God, and they shall be My people."
Therefore come out from among them and be separated, says the Lord, and do not touch the unclean thing. And I will receive you
and I will be a Father to you, and you shall be My sons and daughters, says the Lord Almighty.

I exhort the elders who are among you, I being also an elder and a witness of the sufferings of Christ, and also a partaker of the glory that shall be revealed.
Feed the flock of God among you, taking the oversight, not by compulsion, but willingly; nor for base gain, but readily;
nor as lording it over those allotted to you by God, but becoming examples to the flock.
And when the Chief Shepherd shall appear, you shall receive a never-fading crown of glory.
Likewise, younger ones, be subject to older ones, and all being subject to one another. Put on humility. For God resists proud ones, but He gives grace to the humble.
Therefore be humbled under the mighty hand of God, so that He may exalt you in due time,
casting all your anxiety onto Him, for He cares for you.
Be sensible and vigilant, because your adversary the Devil walks about like a roaring lion, seeking someone he may devour;
whom firmly resist in the faith, knowing that the same afflictions in the world are being completed in your brotherhood.
But the God of all grace, He calling us to His eternal glory by Christ Jesus, after you have suffered a little, He will perfect, confirm, strengthen, and establish you.
To Him be the glory and the might forever and ever. Amen.
I wrote to you through a few words, by Silvanus, a faithful brother to you, as I suppose, exhorting and testifying this to be the true grace of God in which you stand.
The fellow-elected in Babylon greet you; also Mark my son.
Greet one another with a kiss of holy love. Peace be to you, all those in Christ Jesus. Amen.

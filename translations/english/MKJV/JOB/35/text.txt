And Elihu answered and said,
Do you think this to be right, you that say, I am more just than God?
For you say, What will it benefit you? And, What good shall I have more than if I had sinned?
I will answer your words, and your friends with you.
Look to the heavens, and see; and behold the clouds; they are higher than you.
If you sin, what do you do against Him? Or if your transgressions are multiplied, what do you do to Him?
If you are righteous, what do you give Him? Or what does He receive from your hand?
Your wickedness may hurt a man like yourself; and your righteousness may profit the son of man.
From the host of tyrannies they cry out; they cry out because of the arm of the multitude.
But none says, Where is God my Maker, who gives songs in the night;
who teaches us more than the animals of the earth, and makes us wiser than the birds of the heavens?
There they cry, but He gives no answer, because of the pride of evildoers.
Surely God will not hear vanity, neither will the Almighty look on it.
How much less when you say you do not see Him! Judgment is before Him; you are waiting for Him.
And now, because His anger has not visited, and He does not recognize stupidity,
even Job opens his mouth in vanity; he multiplies words without knowledge.

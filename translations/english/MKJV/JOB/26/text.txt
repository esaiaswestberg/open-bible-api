But Job answered and said,
How have you helped the powerless, or saved the arm that has no strength?
How have you advised those not wise, or fully declared wise plans?
To whom have you spoken words? And whose spirit came from you?
The departed spirits tremble under the waters, and those who dwell in them.
Hell is naked before Him, and the Pit has no covering.
He stretches out the north over the empty place, and He hung the earth on nothing.
He binds up the waters in His thick clouds; and the cloud is not torn under them.
He covers the face of His throne, spreading His cloud on it.
He has described a circle on the surface of the waters to the boundary of light with darkness.
The pillars of the heavens tremble and are astonished at His rebuke.
He quiets the sea with His power, and by His understanding He shatters the proud.
By His Spirit the heavens were beautiful; His hand pierced the fleeing serpent.
Lo, these are the edges of His ways; but what a whisper of a word we hear of Him! And the thunder of His power who can understand?

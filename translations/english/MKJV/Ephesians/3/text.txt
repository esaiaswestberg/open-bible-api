For this cause, I, Paul, am the prisoner of Jesus Christ for you nations,
if you have heard of the dispensation of the grace of God which is given to me toward you,
that by revelation He made known to me the mystery (as I wrote before in few words,
by which, when you read, you may understand my knowledge in the mystery of Christ)
which in other ages was not made known to the sons of men, as it is now revealed to His holy apostles and prophets by the Spirit,
that the nations should be fellow heirs, and of the same body, and partaker of His promise in Christ through the gospel.
Of this gospel I was made a minister, according to the gift of the grace of God given to me by the effectual working of His power.
This grace is given to me ( who am less than the least of all saints) to preach the gospel of the unsearchable riches of Christ among the nations,
and to bring to light what is the fellowship of the mystery which from eternity has been hidden in God, who created all things by Jesus Christ;
so that now to the rulers and powers in the heavenlies might be known by the church the manifold wisdom of God,
according to the eternal purpose which He purposed in Christ Jesus our Lord;
in whom we have boldness and access with confidence through His faith.
For this reason I desire that you faint not at my tribulations for you, which is your glory.
For this cause I bow my knees to the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,
of whom the whole family in Heaven and earth is named,
that He would grant you, according to the riches of His glory, to be strengthened with might by His Spirit in the inner man;
that Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith; that you, being rooted and grounded in love,
may be able to comprehend with all saints what is the breadth and length and depth and height,
and to know the love of Christ which passes knowledge, that you might be filled with all the fullness of God.
Now to Him who is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power that works in us,
to Him be glory in the church by Christ Jesus throughout all ages, forever. Amen.

Wisdom has built her house; she has carved out her seven pillars;
she has killed her beasts; she has mixed her wine; she has also set her table.
She has sent out her young women; she cries upon the highest places of the city,
The simple one, let him turn in here. To one lacking heart, she says to him,
Come, eat of my bread and drink of the wine I have mixed.
Forsake the foolish and live; and go in the way of understanding.
One rebuking a scorner gets shame to himself; and one rebuking a wicked one gets himself a blemish.
Do not reprove a scorner, lest he hate you; give to a wise man, and he will love you.
Give to a wise one, and he will be still wiser; teach a just one, and he will increase in learning.
The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom; and the knowledge of the holy is understanding.
For by Me your days shall be multiplied, and the years of your life shall he increased.
If you are wise, you shall be wise for yourself; but if you scorn, you alone shall bear it.
A foolish woman is noisy; she is simple and knows nothing.
For she sits at the door of her house, in a seat in the high places of the city,
to call those who pass by, who are going straight on their ways;
The simple one, let him turn in here. And to one lacking heart, she says to him,
Stolen waters are sweet, and bread eaten in secret is pleasant.
But he does not know that the dead are there; her guests are in the depths of hell.

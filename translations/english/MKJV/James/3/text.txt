My brothers, do not be many teachers, knowing that we shall receive the greater condemnation.
For in many things we all offend. If anyone does not offend in word, the same is a full-grown man, able also to bridle the whole body.
Behold, we put bits in the horses' mouths, so that they may obey us, and we turn about their whole body.
Behold also the ships being so great, and driven by fierce winds, yet they are turned about with a very small rudder, where the impulse of him steering desires.
Even so the tongue is a little member and boasts great things. Behold how little a fire kindles how large a forest!
And the tongue is a fire, a world of iniquity. So the tongue is set among our members, spotting all the body and inflaming the course of nature, and being inflamed by hell.
For every kind of animals, and of birds, and of reptiles, and of sea-animals, is tamed, and has been tamed by mankind.
But no one can tame the tongue, it is an unruly evil, full of deadly poison.
By this we bless God, even the Father. And by this we curse men, who have come into being according to the image of God.
Out of the same mouth proceeds blessing and cursing. My brothers, these things ought not to be so.
Does a fountain send forth at the same hole the sweet and the bitter?
Can the fig tree, my brothers, bear olive berries; or a vine, figs? So no fountain can yield both salt water and fresh.
Who is wise and knowing among you? Let him show his works by his good conduct with meekness of wisdom.
But if you have bitter jealousy and strife in your hearts, do not glory and lie against the truth.
This is not the wisdom coming down from above, but is earthly, sensual, devilish.
For where envying and strife are, there is confusion and every foul deed.
But the wisdom that is from above is first truly pure, then peaceable, gentle, easy to be entreated, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality and without hypocrisy.
And the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace by those who make peace.

And the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
Son of man, set your face against Mount Seir and prophesy against it.
And say to it, So says the Lord Jehovah: Behold, O Mount Seir, I am against you, and I will stretch out My hand against you, and I will make you a ruin and a waste.
I will raze your cities, and you shall be ruined, and you shall know that I am the LORD.
Because you have had a never-ending hatred, and have shed the blood of the sons of Israel by the force of the sword in the time of their calamity, in the time that iniquity had an end,
therefore, as I live, says the Lord Jehovah, I will yield you up to blood, and blood shall pursue you. Since you have not hated blood, even blood shall pursue you.
So I will make mount Seir a ruin, and cut off from it the one passing through, and the one returning.
And I will fill his mountains with his dead. In your hills, and your valleys, and all your rivers, those slain with the sword shall fall in them.
I will make you ruins forever, and your cities shall not be inhabited. And you shall know that I am the LORD.
Because you have said, These two nations and these two lands shall be mine, and we shall possess it; yet the LORD was there;
therefore, as I live, says the Lord Jehovah, I will act by your anger and by your envy which you have shown out of your hatred against them. And I will make Myself known among them when I have judged you.
And you shall know that I am the LORD. I have heard all your blasphemies which you have spoken against the mountains of Israel, saying, Desolation! They are given to us for food.
So with your mouth you have boasted against Me, and have multiplied your words against Me. I have heard them.
So says the Lord Jehovah: When the whole earth rejoices, I will make you a ruin.
As you rejoiced at the inheritance of the house of Israel because of desolation, so I will do to you. You shall be a desolation, O mount Seir and all Idumea, even all of it. And they shall know that I am the LORD.

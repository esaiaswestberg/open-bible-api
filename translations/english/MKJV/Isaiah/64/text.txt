Oh that You would tear the heavens and come down, that mountains would quake before You,
( as the brushwood fire burns, the fire causes water to boil), to make Your name known to Your foes, that the nations may tremble at Your presence!
When You did dreadful things which we did not look for, You came down, the mountains flowed down at Your presence.
And from forever they have not heard, nor did they listen. Eye has not seen a God except You, who works for him who waits for Him.
You meet him who rejoices and works righteousness, those who remember You in Your ways. Behold, You were angry, for we sinned. In them is eternity, and we will be saved.
But we are all as the unclean thing, and all our righteousnesses are as a menstruous cloth. And we all fade as a leaf; and our iniquities, like the wind, have taken us away.
And there is no one who calls on Your name, who stirs up himself to take hold of You. For You have hidden Your face from us, and have melted us away because of our iniquities.
But now, O LORD, You are our Father; we are the clay, and You are our Former; and we all are the work of Your hand.
Do not be grievously angry, O LORD, nor remember iniquity forever. Behold! Look, please; all of us are Your people.
Your holy cities are a wilderness; Zion is a wilderness, Jerusalem is a ruin.
The house of our holiness and our beauty, where our fathers praised You, has become a burning of fire; and all our pleasant things are laid waste.
Will You restrain Yourself over these things, O LORD? Will You be silent and sorely afflict us?

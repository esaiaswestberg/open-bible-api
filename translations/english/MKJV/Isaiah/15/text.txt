The burden of Moab. Because in a night Ar of Moab is laid waste; it is cut off; because in a night Kir of Moab is laid waste; it is cut off.
One has gone up to the house, even to Dibon, the high places, to weep. Moab shall howl over Nebo, and over Medeba; baldness shall be on all their heads, every beard cut off.
In the streets they shall clothe themselves with sackcloth; on the tops of their houses, and in their streets, everyone shall howl, melting in tears.
And Heshbon shall cry, and Elealeh; their voice shall be heard as far as Jahaz. So the armed soldiers of Moab shall cry out; his life is broken to him.
My heart shall cry to Moab; his fugitives flee to Zoar, a heifer of three years. He goes up the ascent to Luhith with weeping; for in the way of Horonaim they shall raise up a cry of ruin.
For the waters of Nimrim are desolation; for the hay has dried up and the grass fails, there is no green thing.
Therefore one made up the remainder and their store; over the torrent of the willows they shall carry them.
For the cry has gone around the border of Moab, its howling even to Eglaim; yea, its howling even to Beer-elim.
For the waters of Dimon are full of blood; for I will put on Dimon more things for the escaped ones of Moab, a lion, even for the remnant of the land.

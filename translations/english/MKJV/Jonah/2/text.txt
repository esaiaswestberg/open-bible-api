And Jonah prayed to the LORD his God out of the fish's belly,
and he said, I cried to the LORD from my distress. And He answered me. Out of the belly of Sheol I cried for help, and You heard my voice.
For You cast me into the depths of the seas, and the current surrounded me. All Your breakers and Your waves passed over me.
Then I said, I am cast off from Your eyes, yet I will look again toward Your holy temple.
Waters encompassed me, even to the soul; the depth closed around me; the seaweed was bound to my head.
I went down to the bottoms of the mountains; the earth with her bars was around me forever; yet You have brought up my life from the pit, O LORD my God.
When my soul fainted within me, I remembered the LORD; and my prayer came in to You, into Your holy temple.
They who take heed to lying vanities forsake their kindness;
but I will sacrifice to You with the voice of thanksgiving; I will fulfill that which I have vowed. Salvation belongs to the LORD!
And the LORD spoke to the fish, and it vomited Jonah out on the dry land.

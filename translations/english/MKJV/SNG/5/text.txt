I have come into My garden, My sister, My spouse; I have gathered My myrrh with My spice; I have eaten My honeycomb with My honey; I have drunk My wine with My milk. Eat, O friends; drink, yea, drink abundantly, O Beloved.
I sleep, but my heart is awake. It is the sound of my Beloved that knocks, saying, Open to Me, My sister, My love, My dove, My undefiled; for My head is filled with dew, My locks with the drops of the night.
I have put off My coat; How shall I put it on? I have washed my feet; how shall I defile them?
My Beloved put in His hand by the hole of the door, and my heart was moved for Him.
I rose up to open to my Beloved; and my hands dripped with myrrh, and my fingers flowing with myrrh on the handles of the bolt.
I opened to my Beloved, but my Beloved had left. He passed on. My soul went out when He spoke; I sought Him, but I could not find Him. I called Him, but He did not answer me.
The watchmen who went about the city found me and struck me; they wounded me. The keepers of the wall lifted my veil from me.
I adjure you, O daughters of Jerusalem, if you find my Beloved, what do you tell Him? That I am sick with love.
What is your Beloved more than another beloved, most beautiful among women? What is your Beloved more than another beloved, that you adjure us so?
My Beloved is bright and ruddy, standing out among ten thousand.
His head is like refined gold; His locks are bushy, black as a raven.
His eyes are as doves' eyes on the rivers of waters, washed with milk, sitting on a setting.
His cheeks are like a bed of spices, a raised bed of aromatic herbs. His lips are as lilies dropping flowing myrrh.
His hands are like rings of gold filled with jewels; His body an ivory plate overlaid with sapphires.
His legs are like pillars of marble set on sockets of fine gold; His face is like Lebanon, excellent as the cedars.
His mouth is most sweet; yes, He is altogether lovely. This is my Beloved, and this is my Friend, O daughters of Jerusalem.

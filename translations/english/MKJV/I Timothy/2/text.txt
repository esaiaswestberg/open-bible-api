First of all, then, I exhort that supplications, prayers, intercessions, and giving of thanks be made for all men,
for kings and all who are in authority, so that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and reverence.
For this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Savior,
who will have all men to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth.
For God is one, and there is one Mediator between God and man, the Man Christ Jesus,
who gave Himself a ransom for all, to be testified in due time.
To this I am ordained a preacher and an apostle (I speak the truth in Christ, I do not lie), a teacher of the nations, in faith and truth.
Therefore, I desire that men pray everywhere, lifting up holy hands, without wrath and doubting.
In the same way also, I desire that women adorn themselves in decent clothing, with modesty and sensibleness, not adorned with braiding, or gold, or pearls, or costly clothing,
but with good works, which becomes women professing godliness.
Let the woman learn in silence with all subjection.
But I do not allow a woman to teach, or to exercise authority over a man, but to be in silence.
For Adam was first formed, then Eve.
And Adam was not deceived, but the woman being deceived was in the transgression.
But she will be kept safe through childbearing, if they continue in faith and love and holiness with sensibleness.

How beautiful are your feet in sandals, O prince's daughter! The curves of your thighs are like jewels, the work of the hands of a skillful workman.
Your navel is like a round goblet, which never lacks mixed wine; your belly is like a heap of wheat set about with lilies.
Your two breasts are like two fawns, twins of a gazelle.
Your neck is like a tower of ivory; your eyes like the fish-pools in Heshbon, by the gate of Beth-rabbim; your nose is like the tower of Lebanon which looks toward Damascus.
Your head on you is like Carmel, and the hair of your head like purple cloth; the King is held captive in its tresses.
How beautiful and how pleasant you are, O love, for delights!
Your stature is like a palm tree, and your breasts are like clusters of grapes.
I said, I will go up in the palm tree, I will take hold of its stalk. And please let your breasts be like clusters of the vine, and the smell of your nose like apples;
and the roof of your mouth like the best wine for my Beloved, that goes down smoothly for My Beloved, flowing softly over the lips of sleeping ones.
I am my Beloved's, and His desire is toward me.
Come, my Beloved, let us go out into the field; let us stay in the villages.
Let us rise up early to the vineyards; let us see if the vine flowers, whether the tender grape appears, and the pomegranates bud forth; there I will give You my loves.
The love-apples give a scent, and over our doors are all pleasant fruits, new and old, which I have laid up for You, O my Beloved.

For behold, the day is coming, burning like a fire pot; and all the proud, and every doer of wickedness, shall be chaff. And the coming day will set them ablaze, says the LORD of hosts, which will not leave root or branches to them.
But to you who fear My name, the Sun of Righteousness shall arise, and healing will be on His wings. And you shall go out and frisk like calves of the stall.
And you shall trample the wicked, for they shall be ashes under the soles of your feet in the day which I am preparing, says the LORD of hosts.
Remember the law of Moses My servant, which I commanded to him in Horeb for all Israel, the statutes and judgments.
Behold, I am sending you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the LORD.
And he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the sons, and the heart of the sons to their fathers, that I not come and strike the earth with utter destruction.

Paul and Silvanus and Timothy to the church of the Thessalonians in God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
Grace to you, and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
We are bound to thank God always for you, my brothers, as it is right, because your faith grows exceedingly, and the love of each one of you abounds toward one another;
so much so that we ourselves glory in you in the churches of God, for your patience and faith in all your persecutions and tribulations which you endure.
For this is a manifest token of the righteous judgment of God, that you may be counted worthy of the kingdom of God for which you also suffer,
since it is a righteous thing with God to repay tribulation to those who trouble you,
and to give rest with us to you who are troubled, at the revealing of the Lord Jesus from Heaven with the angels of His power,
in flaming fire taking vengeance on those who do not know God and who do not obey the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ,
who shall be punished with everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord and from the glory of His power,
when He shall come to be glorified in His saints and to be admired in all those who believe (because our testimony among you was believed) in that Day.
Therefore we also pray always for you that our God would count you worthy of this calling and fulfill all the good pleasure of His goodness and the work of faith with power,
that the name of our Lord Jesus Christ may be glorified in you, and you in Him, according to the grace of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ.

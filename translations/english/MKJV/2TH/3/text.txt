Finally, my brothers, pray for us, that the word of the Lord may have free course and be glorified, even as it is with you.
And pray that we may be delivered from unreasonable and wicked men; for all do not have faith.
But the Lord is faithful, who shall establish you and keep you from evil.
And we have confidence in the Lord regarding you, that you both do and will do the things which we command you.
And may the Lord direct your hearts into the love of God, and into the patience of Christ.
Now we command you, brothers, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you withdraw yourselves from every brother who walks disorderly, and not after the teaching which he received from us.
For you yourselves know how you ought to follow us. For we did not behave ourselves disorderly among you,
neither did we eat any man's bread for nothing, but we worked with labor and travail night and day, so that we might not be heavy on any of you
(not because we do not have power, but to make ourselves an example to you, to imitate us).
For even when we were with you, we commanded you this, that if anyone would not work, neither should he eat.
For we hear that there are some who walk disorderly among you, not working at all, but being busybodies.
Now we command and exhort those who are such, by our Lord Jesus Christ, that they work with quietness and eat their own bread.
But you, brothers, do not be weary in well doing.
And if anyone does not obey our word by this letter, mark that one and have no company with him, that he may be ashamed.
Yet do not count him as an enemy, but admonish him as a brother.
And may the Lord of peace Himself give you peace always by all means. The Lord be with you all.
The greeting of Paul by my own hand which is the sign in every letter, so I write.
The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.

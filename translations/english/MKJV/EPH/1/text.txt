Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, to the saints who are in Ephesus, and faithful in Christ Jesus.
Grace be to you, and peace from God our Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ.
Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenlies in Christ;
according as He chose us in Him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and without blame before Him in love,
having predestined us to the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to Himself, according to the good pleasure of His will,
to the praise of the glory of His grace, in which He has made us accepted in the One having been loved.
In Him we have redemption through His blood, the forgiveness of sins, according to the riches of His grace,
which He caused to abound toward us in all wisdom and understanding;
having made known to us the mystery of His will, according to His good pleasure which He purposed in Himself,
for an administration of the fullness of times, to head up all things in Christ, both the things in Heaven, and the things on earth, even in Him,
in whom also we have been chosen to an inheritance, being predestinated according to the purpose of Him who works all things according to the counsel of His own will,
for us to be to the praise of His glory, who previously had trusted in Christ;
in whom also you, hearing the word of truth, the gospel of our salvation, in whom also believing, you were sealed with the Holy Spirit of promise,
who is the earnest of our inheritance, to the redemption of the purchased possession, to the praise of His glory.
Therefore I also, hearing of your faith in the Lord Jesus and love to all the saints,
do not cease giving thanks for you, making mention of you in my prayers,
that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give to you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of Him,
the eyes of your understanding being enlightened, that you may know what is the hope of His calling, and what is the riches of the glory of His inheritance in the saints,
and what is the surpassing greatness of His power toward us, the ones believing according to the working of His mighty strength
which He worked in Christ in raising Him from the dead, and He seated Him at His right hand in the heavenlies,
far above all principality and authority and power and dominion, and every name being named, not only in this world, but also in the coming age.
And He has put all things under His feet and gave Him to be Head over all things to the church,
which is His body, the fullness of Him who fills all in all.

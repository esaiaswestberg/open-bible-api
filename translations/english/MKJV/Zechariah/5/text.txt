And I again lifted up my eyes and looked. And behold! A flying scroll.
And he said to me, What do you see? And I answered, I see a flying roll; its length is twenty cubits, and its width ten cubits.
And he said to me, This is the curse that goes forth over the face of the whole earth; for from now on everyone who steals shall be cut off according to it; and everyone who swears from now on shall be cut off according to it.
I will bring it forth, says the LORD of hosts; and it shall enter into the house of the thief, and into the house of him who swears falsely by My name. And it shall remain in the midst of his house, and shall devour it, and its timber and its stones.
Then the angel who talked with me went forth and said to me, Now lift up your eyes and see what this is that goes forth.
And I said, What is it? And he said, This is the ephah that goes forth. And he said, This is their form in all the earth.
And behold, a lead cover was lifted up, and a woman was sitting in the middle of the ephah.
And he said, This is wickedness. And he cast it into the midst of the ephah. And he cast the lead stone over its opening.
And I lifted up my eyes and looked, and behold, two women came out. And the wind was in their wings; for they had wings like the wings of a stork. And they lifted up the ephah between the earth and the heavens.
And I said to the angel who talked with me, Where are they going with the ephah?
And he said to me, To build a house for it in the land of Shinar; and it shall be established and set there on its own base.

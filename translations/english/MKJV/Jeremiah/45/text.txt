The word that Jeremiah the prophet spoke to Baruch the son of Neriah, when he had written these words in a book at the mouth of Jeremiah, in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah, saying,
So says the LORD, the God of Israel, to you, O Baruch:
You said, Woe is me now, for the LORD has added grief to my sorrow. I fainted in my sighing, and I find no rest.
So you shall say to him, The LORD says this: Behold, what I have built I will break down, and that which I have planted I will pluck up, even all the land itself to Me.
And do you seek great things for yourself? Do not seek them; for behold, I will bring evil on all flesh, says the LORD. But I will give your life to you as a prize, in all places where you go.

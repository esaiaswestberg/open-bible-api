To the Chief Musician. A Psalm of David. How long will You forget me, O LORD? Forever? How long will You hide Your face from me?
How long shall I take counsel in my heart having sorrow in my heart daily? How long shall my enemy be lifted up over me?
Look! Answer me, O LORD my God; enlighten my eyes, lest I sleep the sleep of death,
lest my enemy say, I have overcome him, and my foes rejoice when I am shaken.
But I have trusted in Your mercy; my heart shall rejoice in Your salvation.
I will sing to the LORD, because He has rewarded me.

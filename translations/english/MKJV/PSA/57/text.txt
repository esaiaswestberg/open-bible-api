To the Chief Musician. Do not destroy. A secret treasure of David, when he fled from Saul in the cave. Be merciful to me, O God, be merciful to me; for my soul trusts in You; yea, in the shadow of Your wings I will make my hiding-place, until these great troubles pass by.
I will cry to God most high, to God who does all things for me.
He shall send from Heaven, and save me from the scorn of him who would swallow me up. Selah. God shall send forth His mercy and His truth.
My soul is among lions; I lie among those on fire, the sons of men whose teeth are spears and arrows, and their tongue a sharp sword.
Be praised above the heavens, O God; let Your glory be above all the earth.
They have prepared a net for my steps; my soul is bowed down; they have dug a pit before me, they have fallen into it. Selah.
My heart is fixed, O God, my heart is fixed; I will sing and give praise.
Wake up, my soul! Wake up, harp and lyre! I will awake the dawn.
I will praise You, O LORD, among the peoples; I will sing to You among the nations.
For Your mercy is great to the heavens, and Your truth to the clouds.
Be exalted above the heavens, O God; let Your glory be above all the earth.

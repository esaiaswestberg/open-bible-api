To the Chief Musician. Do not destroy. A secret treasure of David, when Saul sent, and they watched the house to kill him. Deliver me from my enemies, O my God; defend me from those who rise up against me.
Deliver me from the workers of evil and save me from bloody men.
For, lo, they lie in wait for my soul; the mighty are gathered against me; not for my transgression, nor for my sin, O LORD.
Without my fault they run and prepare themselves; awaken to help me, and look on me.
And You, O LORD God of hosts, the God of Israel, awake to visit all the nations; do not be merciful to any plotting evil. Selah.
They return at evening; they make a noise like a dog, and go around the city.
Behold, they bellow out with their mouth; swords are in their lips; for they say, Who hears?
But You, O Jehovah, shall laugh at them; You will mock at all the nations.
O my Strength, let me look to You, for God is my strong tower.
The God of my mercy shall go before me; God shall let me see my desire on my enemies.
Do not kill them, lest my people forget; scatter them by Your power and bring them down, O LORD our shield.
For the sin of their mouth is the word of their lips, even let them even be taken in their pride; and for cursing and the lying which they speak.
Consume them in wrath; consume, so that they may not be; and let them know that God rules in Jacob to the ends of the earth. Selah.
And at evening they shall return; let them howl like a dog, and go around the city.
Let them wander up and down for food, and growl if they are not satisfied.
But I will sing of Your power; yes, I will sing aloud of Your mercy in the morning; for You have been my strong tower and hiding-place in the day of my trouble.
To You, O my strength, I will sing; for God is my strong tower and the God of my mercy.

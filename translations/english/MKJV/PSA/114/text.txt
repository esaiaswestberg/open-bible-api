When Israel went out of Egypt, the house of Jacob from a people of strange language,
Judah was His sanctuary, and Israel was His kingdom.
The sea saw it and fled; Jordan was driven back.
The mountains skipped like rams, and the little hills like lambs.
What ailed you, O sea, that you fled? O Jordan, that you turned back,
O mountains that skipped like rams, O little hills like lambs?
Earth, tremble at the presence of the LORD, at the presence of the God of Jacob,
who turned the rock into a pool of water, the flint into a fountain of waters.

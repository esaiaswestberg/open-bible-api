A Prayer of Moses, the man of God. O LORD, You have been our dwelling-place in all generations.
Before the mountains were brought forth, or ever You had formed the earth and the world, even from everlasting to everlasting You are God.
You turn man to dust, and say, Return, sons of men.
For a thousand years in Your sight are as yesterday when it is past, and as a watch in the night.
You carry them away as with a flood; they are as a sleep; in the morning they are like grass which grows up.
In the morning it sprouts and shoots up; in the evening it is cut down, and dries up.
For we are burned up by Your anger, and by Your wrath we are troubled.
You have set our iniquities before You, our secret sins in the light of Your face.
For all our days pass away in Your wrath; we finish our years like a murmur.
The days of our years are threescore years and ten; and if by strength they are fourscore years, yet their pride is labor and sorrow; for it is soon cut off, and we fly away.
Who knows the power of Your anger? And as Your fear is, so is Your wrath.
So teach us to number our days, so that we may bring a heart of wisdom.
Return, O LORD! How long? And give pity to Your servants.
Satisfy us early with Your mercy, so that we may rejoice and be glad all our days.
Make us glad according to the days of our affliction, the years in which we have seen evil.
Let Your work appear to Your servants, and Your glory to their sons.
And let the beauty of the LORD our God be on us; and establish the work of our hands on us; yea, the work of our hands, establish it.

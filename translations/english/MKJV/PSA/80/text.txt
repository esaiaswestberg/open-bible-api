To the Chief Musician. A Testimony Concerning the Lilies. A Psalm of Asaph. Give ear, O Shepherd of Israel, You who lead Joseph like a flock; You dwelling between the cherubs, shine forth.
Stir up Your strength before Ephraim and Benjamin and Manasseh, and come, save us.
Turn us again, O God, and cause Your face to shine, and we shall be saved!
O LORD God of hosts, how long will You be angry against the prayer of Your people?
You feed them with the bread of tears; and give them tears to drink in great measure.
You make us a strife for our neighbors; and our enemies laugh among themselves.
Turn us again, O God of hosts, and cause Your face to shine; and we shall be saved.
You have brought a vine out of Egypt; You have cast out the nations and planted it.
You cleared before it, and caused it to take deep root; and it filled the land.
The hills were covered with its shadow, and its boughs were as the great cedars.
It sent out its boughs to the sea, and its branches to the river.
Why have You broken down its hedges, so that all those who pass by the way pluck it?
The boar out of the wood wastes it, and the wild beast of the field eats it.
Return, we beg You, O God of hosts; look down from Heaven, and behold, and visit this vine,
and the vineyard which Your right hand has planted, and the Son that You make strong for Yourself.
It is burned with fire, and cut down; they perish at the rebuke of Your holy face.
Let Your hand be on the Man of Your right hand, on the Son of man whom You have made strong for Yourself.
So we will not go back from You; make us live, and we will call on Your name.
Turn us again, O LORD God of Hosts; cause Your face to shine, and we shall be saved.

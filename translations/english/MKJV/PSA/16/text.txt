A Secret Treasure of David. Watch over me, O God; for in You do I put my trust.
Oh my soul, you have said to the LORD, You are my Lord; I have no goodness apart from You.
As to the saints in the earth, they are the excellent, in whom is all my delight.
Their sorrows shall be multiplied who run after another god. I will not pour out their drink offerings of blood; and I will not take their names on my lips.
The LORD is the portion of my inheritance, and of my cup; You shall uphold my lot.
The lines have fallen to me in pleasant places; yea, I have a beautiful inheritance.
I will bless the LORD, who has given me wisdom; my heart also instructs me in the nights.
I have set the LORD always before Me; because He is at My right hand, I shall not be moved.
Therefore My heart is glad, and My glory rejoices; My flesh also shall rest in hope;
For You will not leave My soul in hell; You will not allow Your Holy One to see corruption.
You will make Me know the way of life; in Your presence is fullness of joys. At Your right hand are pleasures forevermore.

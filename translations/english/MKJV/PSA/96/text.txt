Oh sing to the LORD a new song; sing to the LORD, all the earth.
Sing to the LORD, bless His name; show forth His salvation from day to day.
Declare His glory among the nations, His wonders among all people.
For the LORD is great, and greatly to be praised; He is to be feared above all gods.
For all the gods of the nations are idols; but the LORD made the heavens.
Honor and majesty are before Him; strength and beauty are in His sanctuary.
Give to the LORD, O families of the people; give to the LORD glory and strength.
Give to the LORD the glory due to His name; bring an offering, and come into His courts.
O worship the LORD in the beauty of holiness; fear before Him, all the earth.
Say among the nations, the LORD reigns; and the world shall be established; it shall not be moved; He shall judge the peoples in uprightness.
Let the heavens rejoice, and let the earth be glad; let the sea roar, and the fullness of it.
Let the field be joyful, and all that is in it; then shall all the trees of the forest rejoice
before the LORD; for He comes, for He comes to judge the earth; He shall judge the world with righteousness, and the people with His truth.

To the Chief Musician. On Gittith. A Psalm for the sons of Korah. How lovely are Your tabernacles, O LORD of hosts!
My soul longs, yea, even faints for the courts of the LORD; my heart and my flesh shout for joy to the living God.
Even the sparrow has found a house, and the swallow a nest for herself where she may lay her young, Your altars, O LORD of hosts, my king and my God.
Blessed are they who dwell in Your house; they will still praise You. Selah.
Blessed is the man whose strength is in You; Your ways are in their hearts.
Passing through the valley of weeping, they will make it a fountain; the early rain also covers it with blessings.
They go from strength to strength, appearing in Zion before God.
O LORD God of hosts, hear my prayer; give ear, O God of Jacob. Selah.
Behold, O God, our shield, and look on the face of Your anointed.
For a day in Your courts is better than a thousand. I had rather be a doorkeeper in the house of my God, than dwell in the tents of wickedness.
For the LORD God is a sun and shield; the LORD will give grace and glory; no good thing will He withhold from those who walk uprightly.
O LORD of hosts, blessed is the man who trusts in You.

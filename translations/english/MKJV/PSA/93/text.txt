The LORD reigns, He is clothed with majesty; the LORD is clothed with strength. He clothed Himself and the world is established; it shall not be shaken.
Your throne is established of old; You are from everlasting.
The floods have lifted up, O LORD, the floods have lifted up their voices; the floods lift up their waves.
The LORD on high is mightier than the noise of many waters, than the mighty waves of the sea.
Your testimonies are very sure; holiness becomes Your house forever, O LORD.

Judge me, O God, and plead my cause against an ungodly nation. Oh deliver me from the deceitful and unjust man.
For You are the God of my strength; why do You cast me off? Why do I go mourning under the affliction of the enemy?
Oh send out Your light and Your truth; let them lead me; let them bring me to Your holy hill, and to Your tabernacles.
Then I will go to the altar of God, to God my exceeding joy; yea, on the harp I will praise You, O God, my God.
Why are you cast down, O my soul? And why do you moan within me? Hope in God; for I still praise Him, the salvation of my face, and my God.

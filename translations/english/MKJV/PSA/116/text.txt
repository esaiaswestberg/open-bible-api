I love the LORD because He hears my voice and my prayers.
Because He has bowed down His ear to me, therefore I will call on Him in my days.
The sorrows of death hemmed me in, and the pains of hell took hold on me; I found trouble and sorrow.
Then I called on the name of the LORD; O LORD, I beseech You, deliver my soul.
Gracious is the LORD, and righteous; yea, our God is merciful.
The LORD keeps the simple; I was brought low, and He helped me.
Return to your rest, O my soul; for the LORD has dealt bountifully with you.
For You have delivered my soul from death, my eyes from tears, my feet from falling.
I will walk before the LORD in the land of the living.
I believed, therefore I have spoken; I was greatly afflicted;
I said in my haste, All men are liars.
What shall I give to the LORD for all His benefits toward me?
I will take the cup of salvation, and call on the name of the LORD.
I will pay my vows to the LORD now in the presence of all His people.
Precious in the sight of the LORD is the death of His saints.
O LORD, truly I am Your servant; I am Your servant, and the son of Your handmaid; You have loosed my bonds.
I will offer to You the sacrifice of thanksgiving, and will call on the name of the LORD.
I will pay my vows to the LORD now in the presence of all His people,
in the courts of the LORD's house, in the midst of you, O Jerusalem. Praise the LORD!

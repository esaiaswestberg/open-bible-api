To the Chief Musician. A contemplation; for the sons of Korah. As the hart pants after the water brooks, so my soul pants after You, O God.
My soul thirsts for God, for the living God; when shall I come and appear before God?
My tears have been my food day and night, while they say to me all the day, Where is your God?
When I remember these things, I pour out my soul on me; for I had gone with the multitude; I went with them to the house of God with the voice of joy and praise, a multitude keeping the feast.
Why are you cast down, O my soul, and moan within me? Hope in God; for I shall praise Him for the salvation of His face.
O my God, my soul is cast down within me; therefore I will remember You from the land of Jordan, and of the Hermons, from mount Mizar.
Deep calls to deep at the noise of Your waterfalls; all Your waves and Your billows have gone over me.
The LORD will command His loving-kindness in the daytime, and in the night His song shall be with me, my prayer to the God of my life.
I will say to God my rock, Why have You forgotten me? Why do I go mourning because of the cruelty of the enemy?
As with a sword in my bones, my enemies shame me; while they say daily to me, Where is your God?
Why are you cast down, O my soul? And why do you moan within me? Hope in God; for I still praise Him, the salvation of my face, and my God.

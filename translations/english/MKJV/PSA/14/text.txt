To the Chief Musician. A Psalm of David. The fool has said in his heart, There is no God! They acted corruptly; they have done abominable works, there is none who does good.
The LORD looked down from Heaven on the sons of men, to see if there were any who understood and sought God.
All have gone aside, together they are filthy; there is none who does good, no, not one.
Have all the workers of iniquity not known, eating up My people as they eat bread? They have not called on the LORD.
There they were in great fear; for God is in the generation of the righteous.
You have shamed the counsel of the poor, because the LORD is his refuge.
Who will bring the salvation of Israel out of Zion? When the LORD brings back the captivity of His people, Jacob shall rejoice, and Israel shall be glad.

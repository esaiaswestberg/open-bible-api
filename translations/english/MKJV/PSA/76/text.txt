To the Chief Musician. For stringed instruments. A Psalm of Asaph. A Song. God is known in Judah, His name is great in Israel.
And His abode is in Salem; and His dwelling-place in Zion.
There He broke the fiery arrows of the bow, the shield, and the sword, and the battle. Selah.
You are more glorious and excellent than the mountains of prey.
The stouthearted have been stripped; they slept their sleep; and none of the men of might have found their hands.
By Your rebuke, O God of Jacob, both the horse and the chariot have sunk into a sleep.
You, even You, are terrifying, and who can stand when once You are angry?
You cause judgment to be heard from Heaven; the earth feared and was still,
when God arose to judgment, to save all the meek of the earth. Selah.
Surely the wrath of man shall praise You; the wrath that is left, You shall bind up.
Vow, and pay to the LORD your God; let all that are around Him bring presents to the Fearful One.
He shall cut off the spirit in princes; He is feared by the kings of the earth.

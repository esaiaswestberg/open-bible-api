A Song of degrees. O LORD, remember David and all his afflictions,
how he swore to the LORD; he vowed to the mighty One of Jacob.
Surely I will not come into the tent of my house, nor go up into my bed;
I will not give sleep to my eyes, nor slumber to my eyelids,
until I find out a place for the LORD, a dwelling-place for the Mighty One of Jacob.
Lo, we heard of it at Ephratah; we found it in the fields of the wood.
We will go into His dwellings; we will worship at His footstool.
Arise, O LORD, into Your rest; You, and the ark of Your strength.
Let Your priests be clothed with righteousness, and Your saints shout for joy.
For Your servant David's sake, turn not away the face of Your anointed.
The LORD has sworn to David in truth; He will not turn from it; Of the fruit of your body I will set on the throne for you.
If your sons will keep My covenant and My testimonies which I shall teach them, their sons shall also sit on your throne forever.
The LORD has chosen Zion; He has desired it for His dwelling-place.
This is My rest forever; here I will dwell; for I have desired it.
I will greatly bless her food; I will satisfy her poor with bread.
I also will clothe her priests with salvation; and her saints shall shout aloud for joy.
There I will make the horn of David to bud; I have prepared a lamp for My anointed.
I will clothe his enemies with shame; but his crown shall shine on him.

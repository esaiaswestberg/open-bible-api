To the Chief Musician. A Psalm of David, the servant of the LORD. The oracle utters transgression to the wicked within my heart. There is no fear of God before his eyes.
For he flatters himself in his own eyes in order to find his iniquity, to hate it.
The words of his mouth are evil and deceit; he has stopped acting wise and doing good.
He plots evil on his bed; he sets himself in a way that is not good; he does not hate evil.
Your mercy, O LORD, is in the heavens; Your faithfulness reaches to the clouds.
Your righteousness is like the great mountains; Your judgments are a great deep; O LORD, You keep man and beast.
How precious is Your loving-kindness, O God! And the sons of men take refuge under the shadow of Your wing.
They shall be satisfied with the fatness of Your house; and You shall make them drink of the river of Your pleasures.
For with You is the fountain of life; in Your light we shall see light.
O continue Your loving-kindness to those who know You, and Your righteousness to the upright in heart.
Do not let the foot of pride come against me, and do not let the hand of the wicked move me.
There the evil-doers have fallen; they are cast down, and cannot rise.

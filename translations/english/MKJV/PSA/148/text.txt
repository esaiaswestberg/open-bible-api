Praise the LORD! Praise the LORD from the heavens; praise Him in the heights.
Praise Him, all His angels; praise Him, all His hosts.
Praise Him, sun and moon; praise Him, all stars of light.
Praise Him, heavens of heavens, and waters that are above the heavens.
Let them praise the name of the LORD; for He commanded, and they were created.
He has also settled them forever and ever; He has made a decree which shall not pass away.
Let praise be to the LORD from the earth, the sea-monsters, and all deeps;
fire and hail, snow and vapor, stormy wind fulfilling His word,
mountains and all hills, fruitful trees and all cedars,
beasts and all cattle, creeping things and birds of the wing,
kings of the earth and all people, princes and all judges of the earth,
both young men and maidens, old men and children;
let them praise the name of the LORD; for His name alone is excellent; His glory is above the earth and heavens.
He also lifts up the horn of His people, the praise of all His saints, even of the sons of Israel, a people near to Him. Praise the LORD!

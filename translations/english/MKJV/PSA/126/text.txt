A Song of degrees. When the LORD turned again the captivity of Zion, we were like those who dream.
Then our mouth was filled with laughter, and our tongue with singing; then they said among the nations, The LORD has done great things with them.
Great things did the LORD to work with us and we are glad.
Turn again our captivity, O LORD, as the streams in the south.
Those who sow in tears shall reap in joy.
He who goes forth and weeps, bearing precious seed, shall doubtless come again with rejoicing, bringing his sheaves with him.

A Song of degrees; of David. Except that it was the LORD who was for us, O may Israel say;
Except that it was the LORD who was for us when men rose up against us,
then they would have swallowed us up alive, when their wrath was kindled against us;
then the waters would have flowed over us, the stream would have gone over our soul;
then the proud waters would have gone over our soul.
Blessed is the LORD, who has not given us as a prey to their teeth.
Our soul has escaped like a bird out of the snare of the fowlers; the snare is broken, and we have escaped.
Our help is in the name of the LORD, who made the heavens and earth.

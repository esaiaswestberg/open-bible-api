Not to us, O LORD, not to us, but to Your name give glory, for Your mercy and for Your truth's sake.
Why should the nations say, Where now is their God?
But our God is in Heaven; He has done whatever He has pleased.
Their idols are silver and gold, the work of men's hands.
They have mouths, but they do not speak; they have eyes, but they do not see;
they have ears, but they do not hear; they have noses, but they do not smell;
they have hands, but they do not handle; they have feet, but they do not walk; they do not mutter through their throat.
The ones who make them are like them, and everyone who trusts in them.
O Israel, trust in the LORD; He is their help and their shield.
O house of Aaron, trust in the LORD; He is their help and their shield.
You who fear the LORD, trust in the LORD; He is their help and their shield.
The LORD has been mindful of us; He will bless us; He will bless the house of Israel; He will bless the house of Aaron.
He will bless those who fear the LORD, both small and great.
The LORD shall add on to you, even on you and on your sons.
You are blessed of the LORD who made the heavens and the earth.
The heavens, even the heavens, are the LORD's; but the earth He has given to the sons of men.
The dead do not praise the LORD, nor do any who go down into silence.
But we will bless the LORD from this time forth and forevermore. Praise the LORD!

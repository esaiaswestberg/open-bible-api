A Song of degrees. Out of the depths I have cried to You, O LORD.
Lord, hear my voice, and let Your ears listen to the voice of My prayers.
If You will keep in mind iniquities, O Jehovah, who shall stand, O Lord?
But there is forgiveness with You, that You may be feared.
I wait for the LORD, my soul waits, and in His word I hope.
My soul waits for the LORD more than morning-watchers who are watching for the morning.
Let Israel hope in the LORD; for with the LORD there is mercy, and with Him is plentiful redemption.
And He shall redeem Israel from all his iniquities.

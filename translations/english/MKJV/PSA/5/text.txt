To the Chief Musician, for flutes. A Psalm of David. Give ear to my words, O LORD; consider my meditation.
Listen to the voice of my cry, my King and my God; for to You I will pray.
My voice You shall hear in the morning, O LORD; in the morning I will direct my prayer to You, and I will look up.
For You are not a God that enjoys wickedness; nor shall evil dwell with You.
The foolish shall not stand in Your sight. You hate all doers of iniquity.
You shall destroy those who speak lies; the LORD will despise the bloody and deceitful man.
But I, in the abundance of Your grace, I will come into Your house; I will worship in Your fear toward Your holy temple.
Lead me, O LORD, in Your righteousness, because of my enemies; make Your way straight before my face.
For there is no faithfulness in their mouth; their inward part is wickedness; their throat is an open grave; they flatter with their tongue.
Hold them guilty, O God; let them fall by their own counsels; cast them out in the multitude of their transgressions, for they have rebelled against You.
But let all who put their trust in You rejoice; let them always shout for joy, because You defend them. And let those who love Your name be joyful in You.
For You; O LORD, will bless the righteous; with favor You will surround him as with a shield.

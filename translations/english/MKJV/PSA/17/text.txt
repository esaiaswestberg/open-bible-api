A Prayer of David. Hear the right, O LORD; listen to my cry; Give ear to my prayer, for it is not in lips of deceit.
Let my judgment go out from Your presence; let Your eyes behold uprightly.
You have proved my heart; You have visited me in the night; You have tried me, and You will find nothing; my thoughts do not pass beyond my mouth.
Concerning the works of men, by the words of Your lips, I am kept from the paths of the destroyer.
My steps have been held in Your paths, so that my footsteps have not slipped.
I have called on You, for You will hear me, O God; bow down Your ear to me; hear my speech.
Set our Your wonderful loving-kindness, O Savior of those seeking refuge in You, by Your right hand, from those who rise up against me.
Keep me as the pupil, the daughter of the eye; hide me under the shadow of Your wings,
from the face of the wicked who strip me. Those against my soul, My foes, encircle me.
They are enclosed in their own fat; with their mouth they speak proudly,
They have now hemmed in our steps. They have set their eyes to bow me to the earth,
Their likeness is like a lion that longs to tear, and like a young lion lurking in secret places.
Arise, O LORD, disappoint him, bow him down; deliver my soul from the wicked by Your sword,
from men by Your hand, O LORD, from men of the world whose portion is in this life, and whose belly You fill with Your treasure. They are satisfied with sons, and will leave their riches to their babes.
As for me, I will behold Your face in righteousness; when I awake, I shall be satisfied with Your image.

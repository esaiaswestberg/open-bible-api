A Psalm of Solomon. Give the King Your judgments, O God, and Your righteousness to the King's son.
He will judge Your people in righteousness, and Your poor with judgment.
The mountains shall bring peace to the people, and the little hills by righteousness.
He shall judge the poor of the people; He shall save the children of the needy, and shall crush in pieces the cruel one.
They shall fear You as long as the sun and moon endure, throughout all generations.
He shall come down like rain on the mown grass, like showers that water the earth.
In His days the righteous shall flourish; and abundance of peace, until the moon is not.
He shall also have the rule from sea to sea, and from the River to the ends of the earth.
Those who dwell in the wilderness shall bow before Him; and His enemies shall lick the dust.
The kings of Tarshish and of the isles shall bring presents; the kings of Sheba and Seba shall offer gifts.
Yes, all kings shall fall down before Him; all nations shall serve Him.
For He shall deliver the needy when he cries; and the poor with no helper.
He shall have pity on the poor and needy and shall save the souls of the needy.
He shall redeem their soul from deceit and violence; and their blood shall be precious in His sight.
And He shall live, and to Him shall be given the gold of Sheba; and prayer shall always be made for Him; He shall bless Him all the day long.
There shall be a fullness of grain in the earth on the top of the mountains; its fruit shall shake like Lebanon, and they of the city shall flourish like grass of the earth.
His name shall endure forever; His name shall be continued as long as the sun; and men shall be blessed in Him; all nations shall call Him blessed.
Blessed is the LORD God, the God of Israel, who alone does wonderful things.
And blessed be His glorious name forever; and all the earth is filled with His glory! Amen and Amen.
The prayers of David the son of Jesse are ended.

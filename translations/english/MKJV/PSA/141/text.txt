A Psalm of David. O LORD, I cry to You; make haste to me, give ear to my voice when I cry to You.
Let my prayer be set forth before You as incense, and the lifting up of my hands as the evening sacrifice.
Set a watch, O LORD, before my mouth; keep the door of my lips.
Let not my heart turn aside to any evil thing, to practice wicked works with men who work iniquity; and let me not eat of their delicacies.
Let the righteous strike me; it shall be a kindness; and let him correct me, it is oil on my head, let not my head refuse it; for still my prayer also shall be against their wickedness.
When their judges are overthrown in stony places, they shall hear my words; for they are sweet.
Our bones are scattered at the grave's mouth, as when one cuts and splits wood on the earth.
But my eyes are on You, O Lord Jehovah; in You I take refuge, do not leave my soul naked.
Keep me from the traps which they have laid for me, and the snares of the workers of evil.
Let the wicked fall into their own nets together, while I escape.

A Psalm. O sing to the LORD a new song; for He has done marvelous things; His right hand and His holy arm have saved for Him.
The LORD has made known His salvation; His righteousness He has unveiled to the eyes of the nations.
He has remembered His mercy and His truth toward the house of Israel; all the ends of the earth have seen the salvation of our. GOD.
Make a joyful noise to the LORD, all the earth; breakout, and rejoice, and sing praise.
Sing to the LORD with the harp; with the harp, and the voice of a psalm.
With trumpets and sound of a horn make a joyful noise before the LORD, the King.
Let the sea roar, and the fullness of it; the world, and those who live in it.
Let the floods clap their hands; let the hills be joyful together
before the LORD; for He comes to judge the earth; with righteousness He shall judge the world, and the peoples in uprightness.

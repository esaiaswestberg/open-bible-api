A Song of degrees. They who trust in the LORD shall be like Mount Zion; it is not shaken, but remains forever.
As the mountains are all around Jerusalem, so the LORD is all around His people from this time and forever.
For the rod of the wicked shall not rest on the lot of the righteous; lest the righteous put forth their hands to iniquity.
Do good, O LORD, to the good, and to the upright in their hearts.
And those who turn aside to their crooked ways, the LORD shall lead them forth with the workers of iniquity; peace shall be on Israel.

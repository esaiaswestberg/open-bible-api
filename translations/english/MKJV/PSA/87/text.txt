A Psalm for the sons of Korah, A Song. His foundation is in the holy mountains.
The LORD loves the gates of Zion more than all the dwellings of Jacob.
Glorious things are spoken of you, O city of God. Selah.
I will mention Rahab and Babylon to those who know me; behold, Philistia and Tyre, with Ethiopia; this man was born there.
And to Zion it shall be said, This man and that man was born in her; and the Highest shall establish her.
The LORD shall count, in recording the peoples, that this man was born there. Selah.
And the singers, the players of the pipe: all my springs are in You!

A Psalm of David. Give to the LORD, O you mighty, give to the LORD glory and strength.
Give to the LORD the glory due to His name; worship the LORD in the beauty of holiness.
The voice of the LORD is on the waters; the God of glory thunders; the LORD is above many waters.
The voice of the LORD is in power, the voice of the LORD is in majesty.
The voice of the LORD breaks the cedars; yea, the LORD breaks the cedars of Lebanon.
He also makes them to skip like a calf, Lebanon and Sirion like a young wild ox.
The voice of the LORD goes through flames of fire.
The voice of the LORD shakes the wilderness; the LORD shakes the wilderness of Kadesh.
The voice of the LORD causes the does to calve, and uncovers the forests; and in His temple all of it is saying, Glory!
The LORD sits on the flood; yea, the LORD sits as King forever.
The LORD will give strength to His people; the LORD will bless His people with peace.

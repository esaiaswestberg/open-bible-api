To the Chief Musician. A Psalm and Song of David. To You silence is praise, O God, in Zion; and to You is a vow paid.
To You who hears prayer, all flesh comes.
Things of iniquity are mightier than I; as for our transgressions, You shall purge them away.
Blessed is the one whom You choose, and cause to come near You. He shall dwell in Your courts; we shall be satisfied with the goodness of Your house, of Your holy temple.
By awesome things in righteousness You will answer us, O God of our salvation; who are the hope of all the ends of the earth and the sea, of those far away.
The mountains are established by Your strength, banded together with might,
who stills the noise of the sea, the roar of their waves, and the uproar of the peoples.
And the inhabitants of the furthermost places are afraid of Your signs; You make the beginning of the morning and the evening rejoice.
You visit the earth and water it; You greatly enrich it; the river of God is full of water; You provide their grain, for in this way You have prepared it.
You fill its terraces with water; You deepen its furrows; You make it soft with showers; You bless the sprouting of it.
You crown the year with Your goodness, and Your paths drop fatness.
They drop on the pastures of the wilderness; and the little hills gird themselves with joy.
The pastures are clothed with flocks; the valleys also are covered over with grain; they shout for joy and sing.

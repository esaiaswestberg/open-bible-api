Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, and have not charity, I have become as sounding brass or a tinkling cymbal.
And though I have prophecies, and understand all mysteries and all knowledge; and though I have all faith, so as to move mountains, and do not have charity, I am nothing.
And though I give out all my goods to feed the poor, and though I deliver my body to be burned, and have not charity, I am profited nothing.
Charity has patience, is kind; charity is not envious, is not vain, is not puffed up;
does not behave indecently, does not seek her own, is not easily provoked, thinks no evil.
Charity does not rejoice in unrighteousness, but rejoices in the truth,
quietly covers all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things.
Charity never fails. But if there are prophecies, they will be abolished; if tongues, they shall cease; if knowledge, it will be abolished.
For we know in part, and we prophesy in part.
But when the perfect thing comes, then that which is in part will be caused to cease.
When I was an infant, I spoke as an infant, I thought as an infant, I reasoned as an infant. But when I became a man, I did away with the things of an infant.
For now we see in a mirror dimly, but then face to face. Now I know in part, but then I shall fully know even as I also am fully known.
And now faith, hope, charity, these three remain; but the greatest of these is charity.

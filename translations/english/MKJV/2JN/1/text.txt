The elder to the elect lady and her children, whom I love in the truth and not only I, but also all those who have known the truth,
for the sake of the truth dwelling in us, and which shall be with us forever.
Grace will be with you, mercy and peace from God the Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, in truth and love.
I rejoiced greatly that I found your children walking in truth, as we have received command from the Father.
And now I beseech you, lady, not as though I wrote a new commandment to you, but that which we had from the beginning, that we love one another.
And this is love, that we walk according to His commandments. This is the commandment, as you heard from the beginning, that you should walk in it.
For many deceivers have entered into the world, who do not confess that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh. This is the deceiver and the anti-christ.
Look to yourselves, so that we may not lose those things which we worked out, but that we may receive a full reward.
Everyone transgressing and not abiding in the doctrine of Christ does not have God. He who abides in the doctrine of Christ, he has both the Father and the Son.
If anyone comes to you and does not bring this doctrine, do not receive him into your house, nor speak a greeting to him.
For he who speaks a greeting to him is partaker of his evil deeds.
Having many things to write to you, I do not want to say with paper and ink. But I trust to come to you and speak face to face, so that our joy may be full.
The children of your elect sister greet you. Amen.

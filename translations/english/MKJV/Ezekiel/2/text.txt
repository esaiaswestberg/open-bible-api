And He said to me, Son of man, stand on your feet, and I will speak to you.
And the Spirit entered into me when He spoke to me, and set me on my feet, so that I heard Him who spoke to me.
And He said to me, Son of man, I am sending you to the sons of Israel, to the nations, the rebelling ones who have rebelled against Me; they and their fathers have sinned against Me, to this day.
And the sons are stiff of face, and hard of heart. I am sending you to them; and you shall say to them, So says the Lord Jehovah.
And they, whether they will hear or whether they will forbear; for they are a rebellious house. Yea, they shall know that there has been a prophet among them.
And you, son of man, do not be afraid of them, and of their words, though briers and thorns are with you, and you dwell among scorpions. Do not be afraid of their words, nor frightened by their faces, though they are a rebellious house.
And you shall speak My words to them, whether they will hear or whether they will forbear, for they are rebellious.
But you, son of man, hear what I am saying to you. Do not be rebellious like that rebellious house. Open your mouth and eat what I am giving you.
And I looked, and behold! A hand was extended to me; and lo, a roll of a book was in it.
And He spread it before me; and it was written on the face and the back. And written on it were weepings, and mourning, and woe.

But you speak the things which become sound doctrine:
aged men to be temperate, sensible, discreet, sound in faith, in love, in patience.
Let the aged women likewise be in reverent behavior, not slanderers, not enslaved by much wine, teachers of good;
that they may train the young women to love their husbands, to love their children,
to be discreet, chaste, keepers at home, good, subject to their own husbands, that the Word of God may not be blasphemed.
Likewise exhort the young men to be discreet;
In all things having shown yourself a pattern of good works: in doctrine, purity, sensibleness, without corruption,
in sound speech that cannot be condemned, that he who is opposed may be ashamed, having no evil thing to say of you.
Slaves are to be obedient to their masters, to please them well in all things, not talking back,
not stealing, but showing all good faith, so that they may adorn the doctrine of God our Savior in all things.
For the grace of God that brings salvation has appeared to all men,
teaching us that having denied ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live discreetly, righteously and godly, in this present world,
looking for the blessed hope, and the glorious appearance of our great God and Savior Jesus Christ,
who gave Himself for us that He might redeem us from all iniquity and purify to Himself a special people, zealous of good works.
Speak these things, and exhort, and rebuke with all authority. Let no one despise you.

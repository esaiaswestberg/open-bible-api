Know this also, that in the last days grievous times will be on us.
For men will be self-lovers, money-lovers, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy,
without natural affection, unyielding, false accusers, without self-control, savage, despisers of good,
traitors, reckless, puffed up, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God,
having a form of godliness, but denying the power of it; even turn away from these.
For of these are those who creep into houses and lead captive silly women loaded with sins, led away with different kinds of lusts,
ever learning and never able to come to the full knowledge of the truth.
But as Jannes and Jambres withstood Moses, so these also resist the truth, men of corrupt mind, reprobate concerning the faith.
But they shall proceed no further. For their foolishness shall be plain to all, as theirs also became.
But you have fully known my doctrine, manner of life, purpose, faith, long-suffering, love, patience,
persecutions, afflictions, such as happened to me at Antioch, at Iconium, at Lystra. What persecutions I endured! But the Lord delivered me out of all.
Yea, and all who desire to live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution.
But evil men and seducers will go forward to worse, deceiving and being deceived.
But continue in the things that you have learned and have been assured of, knowing from whom you have learned them,
and that from a babe you have known the Holy Scriptures, which are able to make you wise to salvation through faith in Christ Jesus.
All Scripture is God-breathed, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness,
that the man of God may be perfected, thoroughly furnished to every good work.

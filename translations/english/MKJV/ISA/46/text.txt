Bel bows down, Nebo stoops; their idols were on the beasts and on the cattle; the things you carried about have become a load, a burden for the weary.
They stoop, they bow down together; they could not deliver the burden, but they themselves have gone into captivity.
Listen to me, O house of Jacob, and all the remnant of the house of Israel, who are borne by Me from the belly, who are lifted from the womb;
even to old age I am He; and to gray hairs I will bear you. I have made, and I will bear; even I will carry, and will deliver you.
To whom will you compare Me, and make Me equal, and compare Me, that we may be alike?
They pour gold out of the bag, and weigh silver out of the measuring rod, and hire a goldsmith; and he makes it a god; they fall down, yea, they bow down.
They carry it on the shoulder, they carry it and set it in its place, and it stands; it shall not move from its place. Yes, one shall cry to it, yet it cannot answer, nor save him out of his trouble.
Remember this, and be a man; return it on your heart, O sinners.
Remember former things from forever; for I am God, and no other is God, even none like Me,
declaring the end from the beginning, and from the past things which were not done, saying, My purpose shall stand, and I will do all My pleasure;
calling a bird of prey from the east, the man of my purpose from a far country. Yes, I have spoken, I will also cause it to come; I have formed; yes, I will do it.
Listen to me, stubborn-hearted who are far from righteousness;
I bring near My righteousness. It shall not be far off, and My salvation shall not wait; and I will place salvation in Zion, My glory for Israel.

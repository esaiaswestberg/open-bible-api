And it happened after the year had ended, at the time kings go forth, Joab led out the power of the army and wasted the country of the sons of Ammon. And he came and besieged Rabbah. But David stayed at Jerusalem. And Joab struck Rabbah and destroyed it.
And David took the crown of their king from off his head and found its weight a talent of gold. And precious stones were in it. And it was set on David's head, and he also brought exceeding much spoil out of the city.
And he brought out the people who were in it. And they sawed with saws and with sharp tools of iron, and with the axes. And so David did with the cities of the sons of Ammon. And David and all the people returned to Jerusalem.
And it happened after this, that there arose war at Gezer with the Philistines. Then Sibbechai the Hushathite killed Sippai, of the children of the giant. And they were humbled.
And there was war again with the Philistines. And Elhanan the son of Jair killed Lahmi the brother of Goliath the Gittite, whose spear was like a weavers' beam.
And again there was a battle in Gath, and a man of stature was there, and his fingers and toes were twenty-four, six on each hand and six on each foot. And he also had been born son of the giant.
But he cursed Israel, and Jonathan the son of Shimea, David's brother, killed him.
These were born to the giant in Gath. And they fell by the hand of David, and by the hand of his servants.

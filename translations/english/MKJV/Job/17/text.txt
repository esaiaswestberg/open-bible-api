My spirit is broken, my days are ended, the graves are ready for me.
Are not mockeries with me? Yea, my eye rests on their insults.
Please lay down a pledge for me with Yourself; who is he who will strike hands with me?
For You have hidden their heart from understanding; therefore You shall not lift them up.
He who for a share informs against friends, even the eyes of his children shall fail.
He has made me also a byword of the peoples; and I am one in whose face they spit.
My eye also is dim from grief; and all my members are like a shadow.
Upright ones shall be amazed at this, and the innocent shall stir himself up against the ungodly.
The righteous also shall hold on his way, and he who has clean hands adds strength.
And now all of them, go back, and please come again; and I shall not find among you a wise man.
My days are past, my purposes are broken off, the desires of my heart.
They set night for day; the light is near in the face of darkness.
If I wait for the grave as my home, I have made my bed in the darkness;
I have said to corruption, You are my father; to the worm, My mother and my sister!
And where then is my hope? And as for my hope, who shall see it?
They shall go down to the bars of the pit, when our descent together is in the dust.

And Job answered and said,
Even today is my complaint bitter; my stroke is heavier than my groaning.
Oh that I knew where I might find Him, that I might come even to His seat!
I would order my cause before Him, and fill my mouth with arguments.
I would know the words which He would answer me, and understand what He would say to me.
Will He plead against me with His great power? No, surely He would give heed to me.
There the righteous might reason with Him; and I would be delivered forever from my Judge.
Behold, I go forward, but He is not there; and backward, but I cannot see Him;
on the left hand, where He works, but I cannot behold Him. He turns to the right, but I do not see Him.
But He knows the way that I take; when He has tried me, I shall come forth as gold.
My foot has held fast in His steps; I have kept His way, and have not fallen away;
nor have I gone back from the commandment of His lips; I treasured the words of His mouth more than my portion.
But He is in one mind, and who can turn Him? Yea, what His soul desires, He does it.
For He fulfilled my lot, and many things like these are with Him.
Therefore I am troubled at His presence; when I look, I am afraid of Him.
For God makes my heart soft, and the Almighty troubles me;
because I was not cut off before the darkness; yea, He covered the darkness from my face.

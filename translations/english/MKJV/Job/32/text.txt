And these three men ceased from answering Job, because he was righteous in his own eyes.
And burned the anger of Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite, of the family of Ram. His wrath burned against Job, because he had justified himself rather than God.
Also his wrath was kindled against his three friends, because they had found no answer and had condemned Job.
And Elihu had waited beside Job with words, because they were older than he in days.
When Elihu saw that there was no answer in the mouth of these three men, then his wrath was kindled.
And Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite answered and said, I am young, and you are very old; therefore I was afraid, and dared not show you my opinion.
I said, Days should speak, and the multitude of years should teach wisdom.
But a spirit is in man giving them perception, even the breath of the Almighty.
It is not the great that are wise, nor the aged who understand judgment.
Therefore I say, Listen to me. I also will declare my opinion.
Behold, I waited for your words; I listened to your reasons, while you searched out what to say.
Yes, I listened to you, and, behold, not one of you proved Job wrong nor answered his words,
that you do not say, We have found out wisdom. God has pushed him down, not man.
And he has not directed his words against me; and I will not answer him with your words.
They are broken; they answer no more; words have left them.
Shall I wait because you do not speak, because they stand still, answering no more?
I also will answer my part; I also will declare my wisdom.
For I am full of words; the spirit within me presses on me.
Behold, my breast is as wine which has no vent; it bursts like new wineskins.
I will speak so that I may be refreshed; I will open my lips and answer.
I will not now lift up the face of a man, nor eulogize any man,
For I do not know how to eulogize; else after a little my Maker would take me away.

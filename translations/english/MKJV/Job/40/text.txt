And the LORD answered Job and said,
Shall a reprover contend with the Almighty? He who reproves God, let him answer it.
And Job answered the LORD and said,
Behold, I am vile! What shall I answer You? I will lay my hand on my mouth.
Once I have spoken; but I will not answer; yea, twice, but I will go no further.
And the LORD answered Job out of the tempest, and said,
Now gird up your loins like a man. I will question you, and you teach Me.
Will you also set aside My judgment? Will you condemn Me so that you may be justified?
And have you an arm like God? Or can you thunder with a voice like His?
Adorn yourself now with majesty and grandeur, and with glory and honor clothe yourself.
Pour forth the rage of your wrath; and behold everyone who is proud, and abase him.
Look on everyone who is proud, and bring him low; and tread down the wicked in their place.
Hide them in the dust together; and bind their faces in darkness.
Then I also will confess to you that your own right hand can save you.
Now behold behemoth, which I made along with you; he eats grass like an ox;
see, now, his strength is in his loins, and his force is in the muscles of his belly.
He hangs his tail like a cedar; the sinews of his thighs are knit together.
His bones are like tubes of bronze; his bones are like bars of iron.
He is the first of the ways of God; his Maker brings near his sword.
For the mountains yield food for him, and all the beasts of the field play there.
He lies under the lotus, in the hiding place of the reed and the marsh.
The lotus trees cover him with their shadow; the willows of the brook surround him.
Behold, though a flood presses, he does not run away; he feels safe even if Jordan swells up to his mouth.
Shall any take him before his eyes, or pierce through his nose with cords?

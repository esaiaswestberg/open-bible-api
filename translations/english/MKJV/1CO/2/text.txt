And I, brothers, when I came to you, did not come with excellency of speech or of wisdom, declaring to you the testimony of God.
For I determined not to know anything among you except Jesus Christ and Him crucified.
And I was with you in weakness and in fear, and in much trembling.
And my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of men's wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power,
so that your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God.
But, we speak wisdom among those who are perfect; yet not the wisdom of this world, nor of the rulers of this world, that come to nothing.
But we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery, which God has hidden, predetermining it before the world for our glory;
which none of the rulers of this world knew (for if they had known, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory).
But as it is written, "Eye has not seen, nor ear heard," nor has it entered into the heart of man, "the things which God has prepared for those who love Him."
But God has revealed them to us by His Spirit; for the Spirit searches all things, yea, the deep things of God.
For who among men knows the things of a man except the spirit of man within him? So also no one knows the things of God except the Spirit of God.
But we have not received the spirit of the world, but the Spirit from God, so that we might know the things that are freely given to us by God.
These things we also speak, not in words which man's wisdom teaches, but which the Holy Spirit teaches, comparing spiritual things with spiritual.
But the natural man does not receive the things of the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness to him; neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned.
But he who is spiritual judges all things, yet he himself is judged by no man.
For who has known the mind of the Lord, that he may instruct Him? But we have the mind of Christ.

The Lord Jehovah made me see this: And behold, a basket of summer fruit!
And He said, Amos, what do you see? And I said, A basket of summer fruit. Then the LORD said to me, The end has come to My people Israel: I will never pass by them any more.
And the songs of the temple shall be howlings in that day, says the Lord Jehovah. The dead bodies shall be many. In every place one shall throw them out, saying, Hush!
Hear this, you who trample the poor, even to make the humble of the land to fail,
saying, When will the new moon be gone so that we may sell grain? And the sabbath, that we may set forth wheat, making the ephah small and the shekel great, and perverting the balances by deceit;
that we may buy the poor for silver and the needy for a pair of sandals; and sell the chaff of the wheat?
The LORD has sworn by the Glory of Jacob, Surely I will never forget any of their works.
Shall not the land tremble for this, and all who dwell in it mourn? And all of it shall rise up like the light. And it shall overflow and sink like the Nile of Egypt.
And it shall be in that day, says the Lord Jehovah, I will cause the sun to go down at noon, and I will darken the earth in the light of day.
And I will turn your feast into mourning, and all your songs into weeping; and I will bring up sackcloth on all loins, and baldness on every head. And I will make it like the mourning of an only son, and the end of it like a bitter day.
Behold, the days come, says the Lord Jehovah, that I will send a famine in the land; not a famine of bread nor a thirst for water, but of hearing the words of the LORD.
And they shall wander from sea to sea, and from the north even to the east; they shall run to and fro to seek the word of the LORD, and shall not find it.
In that day the beautiful virgins and the young men shall faint for thirst.
They who swear by the sin of Samaria and say, As your God lives, O Dan; and, As the way of Beer-sheba lives; even they shall fall and never rise up again.

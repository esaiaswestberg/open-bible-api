And the LORD said to me, Go again. Love a woman beloved by a friend, yet an adulteress, according to the love of the LORD toward the sons of Israel, who turn to other gods, and love raisin-cakes of grapes.
So I bought her to me for fifteen pieces of silver, and for a homer of barley and a half homer of barley.
And I said to her, You shall abide for me many days. You shall not be a harlot, nor be for a man. And I also will be for you.
For the sons of Israel shall live many days with no king, and no ruler, and with no sacrifice, and no pillars, and no ephod, or teraphim.
Afterward the sons of Israel shall return and seek the LORD their God and David their king. And they shall fear the LORD and His goodness in the ends of the days.

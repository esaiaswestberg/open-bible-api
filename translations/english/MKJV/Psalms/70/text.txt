To the Chief Musician. A Psalm of David, to bring to remembrance. Make haste, O God, to deliver me; make haste to help me, O LORD.
Let them be ashamed and turned pale, those who seek after my soul; let them be turned backward and blush, those who desire my hurt.
Let them be turned back for a reward of their shame, those who say, Aha, aha!
Let all those who seek You rejoice and be glad in You; and let those who love Your salvation say without ending, Let God be magnified.
But I am poor and needy; make haste to me, O God; You are my help and my deliverer; O LORD, wait no longer!

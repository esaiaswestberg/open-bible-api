A Psalm of David. Hear my prayer O LORD; give ear to my supplications; in Your faithfulness and in Your righteousness answer me.
And do not enter into judgment with Your servant, for in Your sight no one living is just.
For the enemy has pursued my soul; he has beaten my life down to the ground; he has made me dwell in darkness, as those long dead.
And my spirit has fainted within me; my heart has become weary within me.
I remember the days of old; I think on all Your works; I muse on the work of Your hands.
I stretch forth my hands to You; my soul thirsts after You like a thirsty land. Selah.
Hear me quickly, O LORD; my spirit fails; do not hide Your face from me, lest I be like those who go down into the Pit.
Cause me to hear Your loving-kindness in the morning, for I do trust in You; cause me to know the way in which I should walk, for I lift up my soul to You.
Deliver me, O LORD, from my enemies; I flee to You to hide me.
Teach me to do Your will; for You are my God; Your Spirit is good; lead me into the land of uprightness.
O LORD, for Your name's sake enliven me; for Your righteousness' sake, bring my soul out of trouble.
And out of Your mercy cut off my enemies, and destroy all those who afflict my soul; for I am Your servant.

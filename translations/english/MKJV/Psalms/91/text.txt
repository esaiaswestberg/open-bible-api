He who dwells in the secret place of the Most High shall rest under the shadow of the Almighty.
I will say of the LORD, my refuge and my fortress; my God; in Him I will trust.
Surely He will deliver you from the fowler's trap and from the destroying plague.
He shall cover you with His feathers, and under His wings you shall trust. His truth shall be your shield, and buckler.
You shall not fear the terror by night; nor because of the arrow that flies by day;
nor for the plague that walks in darkness, of the destruction laying waste at noonday.
A thousand shall fall at your side, and ten thousand at your right hand; it shall not come near you.
Only with your eyes you shall look and see the reward of the wicked.
Because You, O LORD, are My refuge; if you have made the Most High Your dwelling-place,
no evil shall befall You, nor shall any plague come near Your dwelling.
For He shall give His angels charge over You, to keep You in all Your ways.
They shall bear You up in their hands, lest You dash your foot against a stone.
You shall tread on the lion and adder; the young lion and the jackal You shall trample underfoot.
Because He has set His love on Me, therefore I will deliver him; I will set Him on high, because He has known My name.
He shall call on Me, and I will answer Him; I will be with Him in trouble; I will deliver Him, and honor Him.
With long life I will satisfy him, and show him My salvation.

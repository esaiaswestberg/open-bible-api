A Song of degrees. Blessed is everyone who fears the LORD, who walks in His ways.
For you shall surely eat the labor of your hands; you shall be happy, and all is well with you.
Your wife shall be like a fruitful vine by the sides of your house; your sons shall be like olive plants around your table.
Behold! So shall the man be blessed who fears the LORD.
The LORD shall bless you out of Zion; and you shall see the good of Jerusalem all the days of your life.
Yea, you shall see the sons of your sons. Peace be on Israel.

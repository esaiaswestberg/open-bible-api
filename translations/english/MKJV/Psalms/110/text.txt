A Psalm of David. The LORD said to my Lord, Sit at My right hand until I place Your enemies as Your footstool.
The LORD shall send the rod of Your strength out of Zion; rule in the midst of Your enemies.
Your people shall be willing in the day of Your power, in holy adornment from the womb of the morning: You have the dew of Your youth.
The LORD has sworn, and will not repent, You are a priest forever after the order of Melchizedek.
The Lord at Your right hand shall strike through kings in the day of His wrath.
He shall judge among the nations, He shall fill them with dead bodies; He shall shatter heads over much of the earth.
He shall drink of the brook in the way; therefore He shall lift up the head.

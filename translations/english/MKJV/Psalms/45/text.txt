To the Chief Musician. Concerning the Lilies, for the sons of Korah, a contemplation; A Song of Loves. My heart is overflowing with a good matter; I speak of my works to the King; my tongue is the pen of a ready writer.
You are the fairest of the sons of men; grace is poured into Your lips; therefore God has blessed You forever.
Gird Your sword on Your thigh, O mighty one, with Your glory and Your majesty.
And ride prosperously in Your majesty, because of truth and meekness and righteousness; and Your right hand shall teach You fearful things.
Your arrows are sharp in the heart of the King's enemies; peoples fall under You.
Your throne, O God, is forever and ever; the staff of Your kingdom is a staff of righteousness.
You love righteousness, and hate wickedness; therefore God, Your God, has anointed You with the oil of gladness above Your fellows.
All Your garments smell of myrrh, and aloes and cassia, out of the ivory palaces, by which they have made You glad.
Kings' daughters are among Your precious ones; on Your right hand stands the queen in gold of Ophir.
Listen, O daughter, and look; and bow down your ear; and forget your own people and your father's house.
And cause the King greatly to desire your beauty, for He is your Lord, and you shall worship Him.
And the daughter of Tyre shall be there with a gift; even the rich among the peoples shall stroke your face.
The king's daughter is all glorious within; her clothing is trimmed with gold.
She shall be brought to the king in clothing of needlework; the virgins, her companions after her, shall be brought to You.
They shall be led with joy and gladness; they shall enter into the King's palace.
Your sons shall be in the place of your fathers; you will make them princes in all the land.
I will make Your name to be remembered in all generations; therefore the people shall praise You forever and ever.

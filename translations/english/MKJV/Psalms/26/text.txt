A Psalm of David. Judge me, O LORD; for I have walked in my truthfulness. I have trusted also in the LORD; I shall not slide.
Examine me, O LORD, and prove me; purify my heart and my mind.
For Your loving-kindness is before my eyes; and I have walked in Your truth.
I have not sat with lying men, neither will I go in with hypocrites.
I have hated the congregation of evil-doers, and will not sit with the wicked.
I will wash my hands in innocency; so I will go around Your altar, O LORD,
so that I may cry out with the voice of thanksgiving, and tell of all Your wonderful works.
LORD, I have loved the dwelling place of Your house, and the place where Your honor dwells.
Do not take away my soul with sinners, nor my life with bloody men
in whose hands is a plot, and their right hand is full of a bribe.
But I will walk in my truthfulness; redeem me and be merciful to me.
My foot stands in an even place; in the congregations I will bless the LORD.

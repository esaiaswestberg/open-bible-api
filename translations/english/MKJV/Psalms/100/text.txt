A Psalm of praise. Make a joyful noise to the LORD, all you lands.
Worship the LORD with gladness; come before His presence with singing.
Know that the LORD, He is God. He has made us, and not we ourselves; we are His people, and the sheep of His pasture.
Enter into His gates with thanksgiving, and into His courts with praise; be thankful to Him, and bless His name.
For the LORD is good; His mercy is everlasting; and His truth endures to all generations.

A Prayer of David. Bow down Your ear, O LORD, hear me; for I am poor and needy.
Preserve my soul; for I am holy; O You my God, save Your servant who trusts in You.
Be merciful to me, O Lord; for I cry to You daily.
Give joy to the soul of Your servant; for to You, O Lord, I lift up my soul.
For You, Lord, are good and ready to forgive, and rich in mercy to all those who call on You.
Give ear, O LORD, to my prayer; and attend to the voice of my prayers.
In the day of my trouble I will call on You; for You will answer me.
Among the gods there is none like You, O Lord; non are like Your works.
All nations whom You have made shall come and worship before You, O Lord, and shall glorify Your name.
For You are great and do wonderful things; You alone are God.
Teach me Your way, O LORD; I will walk in Your truth; my heart rejoices to fear Your name.
I will praise You, O Lord my God, with all my heart, and I will glorify Your name forevermore.
For great is Your mercy toward me; and You have delivered my soul from the lowest hell.
O God, the proud have risen against me, and the company of violent men have sought after my life, and have not set You before them.
But You, O God, are God full of pity, and gracious, long-suffering, and rich in mercy and truth.
Oh turn to me, and have mercy on me; give Your strength to Your servant, and save the son of Your handmaid.
Show me a token for good, so that they who hate me may see and be ashamed; because You, LORD, have helped me and comforted me.

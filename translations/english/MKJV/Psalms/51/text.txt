To the Chief Musician. A Psalm of David, when Nathan the prophet came to him, after he had gone in to Bathsheba. Have mercy on me, O God, according to Your loving-kindness; according to the multitude of Your tender mercies, blot out my transgressions.
Wash me completely from my iniquity, and cleanse me from my sin.
For I confess my transgressions; and my sin is ever before me.
Against You, You only, have I sinned, and done evil in Your sight; that You might be justified when You speak, and be clear when You judge.
Behold, I was brought forth in iniquity, and in sin did my mother conceive me.
Behold, You desire truth in the inward parts; and in the hidden part You shall make me to know wisdom.
Purge me with hyssop, and I shall be clean; wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.
Make me to hear joy and gladness; that the bones which You have broken may rejoice.
Hide Your face from my sins, and blot out all my iniquities.
Create in me a clean heart, O God, and renew a right spirit within me.
Cast me not away from Your presence, and take not Your Holy Spirit from me.
Restore to me the joy of Your salvation, and uphold me with a willing spirit.
Then I will teach transgressors Your ways; and sinners shall be converted to You.
Deliver me from the guilt of shedding blood, O God, O God of my salvation, and my tongue shall sing aloud of Your righteousness.
O LORD, open my lips, and my mouth shall show forth Your praise.
For You do not desire sacrifice; or else I would give it; You do not delight in burnt offering.
The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit; a broken and a contrite heart, O God, You will not despise.
Do good in Your good pleasure to Zion; build the walls of Jerusalem.
Then shall You be pleased with the sacrifices of righteousness, with burnt offering and whole burnt offering; then they shall offer bulls on Your altar.

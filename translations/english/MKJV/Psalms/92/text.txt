A Psalm or Song for the sabbath day. It is good to give thanks to the LORD, and to sing praises to Your name, O Most High;
to show forth Your loving-kindness in the morning, and Your faithfulness every night;
on the ten strings, and on the harp, with sounding music on the lyre.
For You, LORD, have made Me glad with Your work; I will triumph in the works of Your hands.
O LORD, how great are Your works; Your purposes are very deep.
A beastly man does not know; nor does a fool understand this.
When the wicked spring as the grass, and when all the workers of iniquity blossom, it is that they shall be destroyed forever;
but You, LORD, are high forever.
For, lo, Your enemies, O LORD; for lo, Your enemies shall perish; all the workers of iniquity shall be scattered.
But You shall lift up my horn as the wild ox; and I shall be anointed with fresh oil.
Also my eye shall see my desire on my enemies, and my ears shall hear the wicked who rise up against me.
The righteous shall flourish like the palm tree; he shall grow like a cedar in Lebanon.
Those that are planted in the house of the LORD shall flourish in the courts of our God.
They shall still bring forth fruit in old age; they shall be fat and flowering;
to show that the LORD is upright; He is my rock, and no unrighteousness is in Him.

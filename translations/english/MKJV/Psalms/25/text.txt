A Psalm of David. To You, O LORD, I lift up my soul.
O my God, I trust in You; do not let me be ashamed, let not my enemies triumph over me.
Yea, let none who wait on You be ashamed; let them be ashamed who sin without cause.
Make me know Your ways, O LORD; teach me Your paths.
Lead me in Your truth, and teach me; for You are the God of my salvation; on You I wait all the day long.
Remember, O LORD, Your tender mercies and Your loving-kindnesses; for they are from eternity.
Do not remember the sins of my youth, or my rebellings; according to Your mercy remember me for Your goodness' sake, O LORD.
Good and upright is the LORD; therefore He will teach sinners in the way.
The meek He will guide in judgment; and the meek He will teach His way.
All the paths of the LORD are mercy and truth to those who keep His covenant and His testimonies.
For Your name's sake, O LORD, pardon my iniquity; for it is great.
What man is he who fears the LORD? He shall teach him in the way that he shall choose.
His soul shall dwell at ease; and his seed shall inherit the earth.
The secret of the LORD is with those who fear Him; and He will show them His covenant.
My eyes are ever toward the LORD; for He shall pluck my feet out of the net.
Turn to me, and have mercy on me, for I am wasted and afflicted.
The troubles of my heart are enlarged; bring me out of my distresses.
Look on my affliction and my pain, and forgive all my sins.
Look on my enemies; for they are many; and they hate me with cruel hatred.
Keep my soul, and deliver me; let me not be ashamed, for I put my trust in You.
Let purity and uprightness keep me; for I wait on You.
Redeem Israel, O God, out of all his troubles.

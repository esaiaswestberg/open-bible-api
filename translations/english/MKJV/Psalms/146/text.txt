Praise the LORD. Praise the LORD, O my soul.
While I live I will praise the LORD; I will sing praises to my God while I have any being.
Do not put your trust in princes, nor in the son of man in whom there is no salvation.
His breath goes forth; he returns to the earth; in that very day his thoughts perish.
Blessed is he who has the God of Jacob for his help, whose help is in the LORD his God,
who made the heavens and earth, the sea and all that is in it; who keeps truth forever;
who carries out judgment for the mistreated; who gives food to the hungry. The LORD lets the prisoners loose;
the Lord opens the eyes of the blind; the LORD raises those who are bowed down; the LORD loves the righteous;
the LORD preserves the strangers; He relieves the orphan and widow, but the way of the wicked He turns upside down.
The LORD shall reign forever, even your God, O Zion, to all generations. Praise the LORD!

To the Chief Musician on Mahalath. A contemplation. A Psalm of David. The fool has said in his heart, There is no God. They acted corruptly, and have worked out abominable wickedness; there is not one doing good.
God looked down from Heaven on the sons of mankind to see if any was discerning, who was seeking God.
Every one has turned away; they have altogether become filthy; not one is doing good, no, not even one.
Have the workers of iniquity no knowledge? They eat up my people as they eat bread; they have not called on God.
There they dreaded with dread, where no dread was; for God has scattered the bones of him who camps against you; you have put them to shame because God rejects them.
Who will give from Zion the salvation of Israel? When God brings back the captivity of His people, Jacob shall rejoice, and Israel shall be glad.

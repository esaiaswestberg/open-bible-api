A Song of degrees. In my trouble I cried to the LORD, and He heard me.
Deliver my soul, O LORD, from lying lips, from a deceitful tongue.
What shall be given to you? Or what shall be done to you, O false tongue?
Sharp arrows of the mighty, with coals of broom.
Woe is me, that I live in Mesech; I dwell in the tents of Kedar!
My soul has long dwelt with a hater of peace.
I am for peace; but when I speak, they are for war.

A Song of degrees. I will lift up my eyes to the hills. Where shall my help come from?
My help comes from the LORD, who made Heaven and earth.
He will not allow your foot to be moved; He who keeps you will not slumber.
Behold, He who keeps Israel shall neither slumber nor sleep.
The LORD is your keeper; the LORD is your shade on your right hand.
The sun shall not strike you by day, nor the moon by night.
The LORD shall keep you from all evil; He shall keep your soul.
The LORD shall keep your going out and your coming in from this time forth, and even forevermore.

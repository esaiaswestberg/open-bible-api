A Psalm of David, when he fled from his son Absalom. O Lord, how my foes have increased! Many are the ones who rise up against me.
Many are saying of my soul, There is no deliverance for him in God. Selah.
But You, O LORD, are a shield for me; my glory, the One who lifts up my head.
I cried to the LORD with my voice, and He heard me out of His holy hill. Selah.
I laid down and slept. I awoke, for the LORD kept me.
I am not afraid of ten thousands of people who have set against me all around.
Arise, O LORD; save me, O my God; for You have struck all my enemies on the cheekbone. You have broken the teeth of the ungodly.
Salvation belongs to the LORD. Your blessing is on Your people. Selah.

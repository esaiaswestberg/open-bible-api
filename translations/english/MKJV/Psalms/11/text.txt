To the Chief Musician. A Psalm of David. I put my trust in the LORD; how can you say to me, Flee like a bird to the mountains;
for lo, the wicked bend their bow; they make ready their arrow on the string, so that they may secretly shoot at the upright in heart.
If the foundations are destroyed, what can the righteous do?
The LORD is in His holy temple; the LORD's throne is in Heaven; His eyes behold, His eyelids examine the children of men.
The LORD tries the righteous; but His soul hates the wicked and the one who loves violence,
On the wicked He shall rain snares, fire and brimstone; and a horrible tempest shall be the portion of their cup.
For the righteous LORD loves righteousness; His face looks on the upright.

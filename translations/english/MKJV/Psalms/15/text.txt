A Psalm of David. LORD, who shall dwell in Your tabernacle? Who shall dwell on Your holy hill?
He who walks uprightly, and works righteousness, and speaks the truth in his heart;
he does not backbite with his tongue, nor do evil to his neighbor, nor take up a reproach against his neighbor;
in whose eyes the reprobate is despised, but he honors those who fear the LORD; he has sworn to his hurt, and does not change it;
he has not put out his money at interest, nor has he taken a bribe against the innocent. He who does these things shall not be moved forever.

The LORD reigns; let the earth rejoice; let the multitude of islands be glad.
Clouds and darkness are all around Him; righteousness and judgment are the foundation of His throne.
A fire goes before Him and burns up His enemies round about.
His lightnings lit up the world; the earth saw and trembled.
The hills melted like wax at the presence of the LORD, at the presence of the LORD of the whole earth.
The heavens declare His righteousness, and all the people see His glory.
All those who serve graven images are ashamed, those who boast themselves in idols; all gods bow down before Him.
Zion heard and was glad; and the daughters of Judah rejoiced because of Your judgments, O LORD.
For You, LORD, are high above all the earth; You are lifted on high far above all gods.
You who love the LORD, hate evil; He keeps the souls of His saints; He delivers them out of the hand of the wicked.
Light is sown for the righteous, and gladness for the upright in heart.
Rejoice in the LORD, righteous ones; and give thanks at the memory of His holiness.

Praise the LORD! I will praise the LORD with all my heart, in the council of the upright, and of the congregation.
The works of the LORD are great, sought out by all those who have pleasure in them.
His work is honorable and glorious; and His righteousness is standing forever.
He has made His wonderful works to be remembered; the LORD is gracious and full of pity.
He has given food to those who fear Him; He will always be mindful of His covenant.
He has shown His people the power of His works, to give to them the inheritance of the nations.
The works of His hands are truth and judgment; all His commands are true,
standing fast forever and ever; they are done in truth and uprightness.
He sent redemption to His people; He has commanded His covenant forever; holy and awesome is His name.
The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom; all practicing them have good understanding; His praise stands forever.

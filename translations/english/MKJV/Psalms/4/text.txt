To the Chief Musician, for stringed instruments. A Psalm of David. Hear me when I call, O God of my righteousness; You gave room to me in trouble; have mercy on me, and hear my prayer.
O sons of men, how long will you turn My glory into shame? Will you love vanity and seek after a lie? Selah.
But know that the LORD has set apart the godly for Himself. The LORD hears when I call to Him.
Tremble, and sin not; speak within your own heart on your bed and be still. Selah.
Offer the sacrifices of righteousness, and trust in the LORD.
There are many who say, Who will show us any good? LORD, lift up the light of Your face on us.
You have put gladness in my heart, more than in the time that their grain and their wine increased.
I will lie down, both in peace and in sleep. For You alone, LORD, make me dwell in safety.

To the Chief Musician, on eight. A Psalm of David. Help, LORD, for the godly man ceases; for the faithful fail from among the sons of men.
They speak vanity each one with his neighbor; with flattering lips and a double heart they speak.
The LORD shall cut off all flattering lips, the tongue that speaks proud things,
that has said, With our tongue we shall do much; our lips are our own; who is lord over us?
For the oppression of the poor, for the sighing of the needy, I will now arise, says the LORD. I will set in safety, he pants for it.
The words of the LORD are pure words, like silver tried in a furnace of earth, purified seven times.
You shall keep them, O LORD, You shall preserve them from this generation forever.
The wicked walk on every side, when vileness is praised by the sons of men.

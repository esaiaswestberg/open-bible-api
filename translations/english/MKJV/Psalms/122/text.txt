A Song of degrees; of David. I was glad when they said to me, Let us go into the house of the LORD.
Our feet shall stand within your gates, O Jerusalem.
Jerusalem is built like a city that is all joined together as one;
where the tribes go up, the tribes of the LORD, to the testimony of Israel, to give thanks to the name of the LORD.
For there were set the thrones of judgment, the thrones of the house of David.
Pray for the peace of Jerusalem; those who love you shall be blessed.
Peace be within your walls, blessings within your palaces.
For my brothers and companions' sakes, I will now say, Peace be within you.
Because of the house of the LORD our God I will seek your good.

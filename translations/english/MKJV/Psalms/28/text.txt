A Psalm of David. I will cry to You, O LORD; my Rock, do not be deaf to me, lest, if You be silent to me, I become like those who go down into the pit.
Hear the voice of my prayers, when I cry to You, when I lift up my hands toward Your Holy Place.
Draw me not away with the wicked, and with the workers of iniquity, who speak peace to their neighbors, yet evil is in their hearts.
Give them according to their deeds, and according to the wickedness of their practices, give them according to the work of their hands; give them what they deserve.
Because they do not pay attention to the works of the LORD and to the work of His hands, He shall destroy them and never build them up.
Blessed is the LORD, because He has heard the voice of my prayers.
The LORD is my strength and my shield; my heart trusted in Him, and I am helped; therefore my heart greatly rejoices; and with my song I will praise Him.
The LORD is a strength to them, and He is the saving strength of His anointed.
Save Your people, and bless Your inheritance; feed them also, and lift them up forever.

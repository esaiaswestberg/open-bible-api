A Song of degrees; of David. Behold, how good and how pleasant it is for brothers to dwell together in unity!
It is like the precious ointment on the head that ran down on the beard, Aaron's beard, that went down to the mouth of his garments;
like the dew of Hermon that came down on the mountains of Zion; for there the LORD commanded the blessing, life forevermore.

The LORD reigns; let the peoples tremble. He sits between the cherubs; let the earth quake.
The LORD is great in Zion; and He is high above all the peoples.
Let them praise Your great and fearful name; it is holy.
The king's strength also loved judgment; You established uprightness; You worked judgment and righteousness in Jacob.
Praise the LORD our God, and worship at His footstool; He is holy.
Moses and Aaron were among His priests, and Samuel among those who called on His name; they called on the LORD, and He answered them.
He spoke to them in the cloudy pillar; they kept His testimonies and the ordinance that He gave them.
You answered them, O LORD our God; You were a God who forgave them, though You take vengeance for their deeds.
Praise the LORD our God, and worship at His holy hill; for the LORD our God is holy.

Rejoice in the LORD, O righteous ones; praise is becoming for the upright.
Praise the LORD with lyre; sing to Him with a harp of ten strings.
Sing to Him a new song; play skillfully with shouts of joy.
For the word of the LORD is right; and all His works are in truth.
He loves righteousness and judgment; the earth is full of the mercy of the LORD.
By the word of the LORD were the heavens made; and all the host of them by the breath of His mouth.
He gathered the waters of the sea like a heap, setting the depths in storehouses.
Let all the earth fear the LORD; let all the people of the world stand in awe of Him.
For He spoke, and it was done; He commanded, and it stood.
The LORD brings the counsel of the nations to nothing; He breaks the plots of the people.
The counsel of the LORD stands forever, the thoughts of His heart to all generations.
Blessed is the nation whose God is the LORD; the people He has chosen for His inheritance.
The LORD looks down from Heaven; He beholds all the sons of mankind.
From His dwelling place He looks on all the people of the earth.
Together He forms their hearts; His understanding is to all their works.
The king is not saved by a great army; a mighty man is not delivered by much strength.
A horse is a vain thing for safety; neither shall he deliver by his great strength.
Behold, the eye of the LORD is to those who fear Him, on those who hope in His mercy;
to deliver their soul from death, and to keep them alive in famine.
Our soul waits for the LORD; He is our help and our shield.
For our heart shall rejoice in Him, because we trust in His holy name.
Let Your mercy, O LORD, be on us, according as we hope in You.

A Psalm of Asaph. God stands in the congregation of God; in the midst of the gods He judges.
How long will you judge unjustly and lift up the faces of the wicked? Selah.
Defend the poor and fatherless; do justice to the afflicted and needy.
Deliver the poor and needy; save them out of the hand of the wicked.
They neither know nor will understand; they walk on in darkness; all the foundations of the earth are shaken.
I have said, You are gods; and all of you sons of the Most High.
But you shall die like men, and fall like one of the princes.
Arise, O God, judge the earth; for You shall inherit in all nations.

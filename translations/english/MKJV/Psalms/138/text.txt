A Psalm of David. I will praise You with my whole heart; before the gods I will sing praise to You.
I will worship toward Your holy temple, and praise Your name for Your loving-kindness and for Your truth's sake; for You have magnified Your word above all Your name.
In the day when I cried You answered me and made me bold with strength in my soul.
All the kings of the earth shall praise You, O LORD, when they hear the words of Your mouth.
Yea, they shall sing in the ways of the LORD; for great is the glory of the LORD.
Though the LORD is high, yet He has respect to the lowly; but the proud He knows afar off.
If I walk in the midst of trouble, You will give me life; You shall stretch forth Your hand against the wrath of my enemies, and Your right hand shall save me.
The LORD will perfect His work in me; Your mercy, O LORD, endures forever; do not forsake the work of Your own hands.

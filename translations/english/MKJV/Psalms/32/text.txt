A Psalm of David. A Contemplation. Blessed is the man whose transgression is forgiven, whose sin is covered.
Blessed is the man to whom the LORD does not charge iniquity, and in whose spirit there is no guile.
When I kept silence, my bones became old through my roaring all the day long.
For by day and by night Your hand was heavy on me; my sap is turned into the droughts of summer. Selah.
I confessed my sin to You, and my iniquity I have not hidden. I said, I will confess my transgression to the LORD; and You forgave the iniquity of my sin. Selah.
For this let every godly one pray to You, in a time when You may be found; surely in the floods of great waters they shall not come near him.
You are my hiding place; You shall preserve me from trouble; You shall circle me with songs of deliverance. Selah.
I will instruct you and teach you in the way which you should go; I will counsel you, My eye shall be on you.
Be not like the horse, or like the mule, who have no understanding, whose mouth must be held in with bit and bridle, so that they do not come near you.
The wicked has many sorrows, but mercy embraces him who trusts in the LORD.
Be glad in the LORD, and rejoice, you righteous; and shout for joy, all you upright in heart.

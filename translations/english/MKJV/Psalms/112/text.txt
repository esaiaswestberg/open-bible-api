Praise the LORD! Blessed is the man who fears the LORD, who delights greatly in His commandments.
His seed shall be mighty on earth; the generation of the upright shall be blessed.
Wealth and riches shall be in his house, and his righteousness stands forever.
To the upright there arises light in the darkness; he is gracious and full of pity and righteousness.
A good man shows favor, and lends; he will guide his business with fairness.
Surely he shall not be moved forever; the righteous shall be remembered forever.
He shall not be afraid of bad news; his heart is fixed, trusting in the LORD.
His heart is sure; he shall not be afraid though he sees his oppressors.
He has scattered abroad; he has given to the poor; his righteousness endures forever; his horn shall be lifted up with honor.
The wicked shall see and be vexed; he shall gnash with his teeth and melt away; the desire of the wicked shall perish.

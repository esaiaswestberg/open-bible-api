And he arose from there, and comes into the coasts of Judaea by the farther side of Jordan: and the people resort to him again; and, as he was wont, he taught them again.   ¶
And the Pharisees came to him, and asked him, Is it lawful for a man to put away his wife? tempting him.
And he answered and said to them, What did Moses command you?
And they said, Moses suffered to write a bill of divorce, and to put her away.
And Jesus answered and said to them, For the hardness of your heart he wrote you this precept.
But from the beginning of the creation God made them male and female.
For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and join to his wife;
And they two shall be one flesh: so then they are no more two, but one flesh.
What therefore God has joined together, let not man put asunder.
And in the house his disciples asked him again of the same matter.
And he says to them, Whoever shall put away his wife, and marry another, commits adultery against her.
And if a woman shall put away her husband, and be married to another, she commits adultery.   ¶
And they brought young children to him, that he should touch them: and his disciples rebuked those that brought them.
But when Jesus saw it, he was much displeased, and said to them, Suffer the little children to come to me, and forbid them not: for of such is the kingdom of God.
Truly I say to you, Whoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child, he shall not enter therein.
And he took them up in his arms, put his hands on them, and blessed them.   ¶
And when he was gone forth into the way, there came one running, and kneeled to him, and asked him, Good Master, what shall I do that I may inherit eternal life?
And Jesus said to him, Why call you me good? there is none good but one, that is, God.
You know the commandments, Do not commit adultery, Do not kill, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Defraud not, Honor your father and mother.
And he answered and said to him, Master, all these have I observed from my youth.
Then Jesus beholding him loved him, and said to him, One thing you lack: go your way, sell whatever you have, and give to the poor, and you shall have treasure in heaven: and come, take up the cross, and follow me.
And he was sad at that saying, and went away grieved: for he had great possessions.   ¶
And Jesus looked round about, and says to his disciples, How hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God!
And the disciples were astonished at his words. But Jesus answers again, and says to them, Children, how hard is it for them that trust in riches to enter into the kingdom of God!
It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.
And they were astonished out of measure, saying among themselves, Who then can be saved?
And Jesus looking on them says, With men it is impossible, but not with God: for with God all things are possible.   ¶
Then Peter began to say to him, See, we have left all, and have followed you.
And Jesus answered and said, Truly I say to you, There is no man that has left house, or brothers, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for my sake, and the gospel’s,
But he shall receive an hundred times now in this time, houses, and brothers, and sisters, and mothers, and children, and lands, with persecutions; and in the world to come eternal life.
But many that are first shall be last; and the last first.   ¶
And they were in the way going up to Jerusalem; and Jesus went before them: and they were amazed; and as they followed, they were afraid. And he took again the twelve, and began to tell them what things should happen to him,
Saying, Behold, we go up to Jerusalem; and the Son of man shall be delivered to the chief priests, and to the scribes; and they shall condemn him to death, and shall deliver him to the Gentiles:
And they shall mock him, and shall whip him, and shall spit on him, and shall kill him: and the third day he shall rise again.   ¶
And James and John, the sons of Zebedee, come to him, saying, Master, we would that you should do for us whatever we shall desire.
And he said to them, What would you that I should do for you?
They said to him, Grant to us that we may sit, one on your right hand, and the other on your left hand, in your glory.
But Jesus said to them, You know not what you ask: can you drink of the cup that I drink of? and be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with?
And they said to him, We can. And Jesus said to them, You shall indeed drink of the cup that I drink of; and with the baptism that I am baptized with shall you be baptized:
But to sit on my right hand and on my left hand is not my to give; but it shall be given to them for whom it is prepared.
And when the ten heard it, they began to be much displeased with James and John.
But Jesus called them to him, and says to them, You know that they which are accounted to rule over the Gentiles exercise lordship over them; and their great ones exercise authority on them.
But so shall it not be among you: but whoever will be great among you, shall be your minister:
And whoever of you will be the most chief, shall be servant of all.
For even the Son of man came not to be ministered to, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many.   ¶
And they came to Jericho: and as he went out of Jericho with his disciples and a great number of people, blind Bartimaeus, the son of Timaeus, sat by the highway side begging.
And when he heard that it was Jesus of Nazareth, he began to cry out, and say, Jesus, you son of David, have mercy on me.
And many charged him that he should hold his peace: but he cried the more a great deal, You son of David, have mercy on me.
And Jesus stood still, and commanded him to be called. And they call the blind man, saying to him, Be of good comfort, rise; he calls you.
And he, casting away his garment, rose, and came to Jesus.
And Jesus answered and said to him, What will you that I should do to you? The blind man said to him, Lord, that I might receive my sight.
And Jesus said to him, Go your way; your faith has made you whole. And immediately he received his sight, and followed Jesus in the way.

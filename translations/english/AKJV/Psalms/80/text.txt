Give ear, O Shepherd of Israel, you that lead Joseph like a flock; you that dwell between the cherubim, shine forth.
Before Ephraim and Benjamin and Manasseh stir up your strength, and come and save us.
Turn us again, O God, and cause your face to shine; and we shall be saved.
O LORD God of hosts, how long will you be angry against the prayer of your people?
You feed them with the bread of tears; and give them tears to drink in great measure.
You make us a strife to our neighbors: and our enemies laugh among themselves.
Turn us again, O God of hosts, and cause your face to shine; and we shall be saved.
You have brought a vine out of Egypt: you have cast out the heathen, and planted it.
You prepared room before it, and did cause it to take deep root, and it filled the land.
The hills were covered with the shadow of it, and the boughs thereof were like the goodly cedars.
She sent out her boughs to the sea, and her branches to the river.
Why have you then broken down her hedges, so that all they which pass by the way do pluck her?
The boar out of the wood does waste it, and the wild beast of the field does devour it.
Return, we beseech you, O God of hosts: look down from heaven, and behold, and visit this vine;
And the vineyard which your right hand has planted, and the branch that you made strong for yourself.
It is burned with fire, it is cut down: they perish at the rebuke of your countenance.
Let your hand be on the man of your right hand, on the son of man whom you made strong for yourself.
So will not we go back from you: quicken us, and we will call on your name.
Turn us again, O LORD God of hosts, cause your face to shine; and we shall be saved.

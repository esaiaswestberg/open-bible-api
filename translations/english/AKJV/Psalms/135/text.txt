Praise you the LORD. Praise you the name of the LORD; praise him, O you servants of the LORD.
You that stand in the house of the LORD, in the courts of the house of our God.
Praise the LORD; for the LORD is good: sing praises to his name; for it is pleasant.
For the LORD has chosen Jacob to himself, and Israel for his peculiar treasure.
For I know that the LORD is great, and that our Lord is above all gods.
Whatever the LORD pleased, that did he in heaven, and in earth, in the seas, and all deep places.
He causes the vapors to ascend from the ends of the earth; he makes lightning for the rain; he brings the wind out of his treasuries.
Who smote the firstborn of Egypt, both of man and beast.
Who sent tokens and wonders into the middle of you, O Egypt, on Pharaoh, and on all his servants.
Who smote great nations, and slew mighty kings;
Sihon king of the Amorites, and Og king of Bashan, and all the kingdoms of Canaan:
And gave their land for an heritage, an heritage to Israel his people.
Your name, O LORD, endures for ever; and your memorial, O LORD, throughout all generations.
For the LORD will judge his people, and he will repent himself concerning his servants.
The idols of the heathen are silver and gold, the work of men’s hands.
They have mouths, but they speak not; eyes have they, but they see not;
They have ears, but they hear not; neither is there any breath in their mouths.
They that make them are like to them: so is every one that trusts in them.
Bless the LORD, O house of Israel: bless the LORD, O house of Aaron:
Bless the LORD, O house of Levi: you that fear the LORD, bless the LORD.
Blessed be the LORD out of Zion, which dwells at Jerusalem. Praise you the LORD.

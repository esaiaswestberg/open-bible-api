Praise you the LORD. Praise you the LORD from the heavens: praise him in the heights.
Praise you him, all his angels: praise you him, all his hosts.
Praise you him, sun and moon: praise him, all you stars of light.
Praise him, you heavens of heavens, and you waters that be above the heavens.
Let them praise the name of the LORD: for he commanded, and they were created.
He has also established them for ever and ever: he has made a decree which shall not pass.
Praise the LORD from the earth, you dragons, and all deeps:
Fire, and hail; snow, and vapors; stormy wind fulfilling his word:
Mountains, and all hills; fruitful trees, and all cedars:
Beasts, and all cattle; creeping things, and flying fowl:
Kings of the earth, and all people; princes, and all judges of the earth:
Both young men, and maidens; old men, and children:
Let them praise the name of the LORD: for his name alone is excellent; his glory is above the earth and heaven.
He also exalts the horn of his people, the praise of all his saints; even of the children of Israel, a people near to him. Praise you the LORD.

O God, you have cast us off, you have scattered us, you have been displeased; O turn yourself to us again.
You have made the earth to tremble; you have broken it: heal the breaches thereof; for it shakes.
You have showed your people hard things: you have made us to drink the wine of astonishment.
You have given a banner to them that fear you, that it may be displayed because of the truth. Selah.
That your beloved may be delivered; save with your right hand, and hear me.
God has spoken in his holiness; I will rejoice, I will divide Shechem, and mete out the valley of Succoth.
Gilead is mine, and Manasseh is mine; Ephraim also is the strength of my head; Judah is my lawgiver;
Moab is my wash pot; over Edom will I cast out my shoe: Philistia, triumph you because of me.
Who will bring me into the strong city? who will lead me into Edom?
Will not you, O God, which had cast us off? and you, O God, which did not go out with our armies?
Give us help from trouble: for vain is the help of man.
Through God we shall do valiantly: for he it is that shall tread down our enemies.

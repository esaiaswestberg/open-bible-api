Lord, remember David, and all his afflictions:
How he swore to the LORD, and vowed to the mighty God of Jacob;
Surely I will not come into the tabernacle of my house, nor go up into my bed;
I will not give sleep to my eyes, or slumber to my eyelids,
Until I find out a place for the LORD, an habitation for the mighty God of Jacob.
See, we heard of it at Ephratah: we found it in the fields of the wood.
We will go into his tabernacles: we will worship at his footstool.
Arise, O LORD, into your rest; you, and the ark of your strength.
Let your priests be clothed with righteousness; and let your saints shout for joy.
For your servant David’s sake turn not away the face of your anointed.
The LORD has sworn in truth to David; he will not turn from it; Of the fruit of your body will I set on your throne.
If your children will keep my covenant and my testimony that I shall teach them, their children shall also sit on your throne for ever more.
For the LORD has chosen Zion; he has desired it for his habitation.
This is my rest for ever: here will I dwell; for I have desired it.
I will abundantly bless her provision: I will satisfy her poor with bread.
I will also clothe her priests with salvation: and her saints shall shout aloud for joy.
There will I make the horn of David to bud: I have ordained a lamp for my anointed.
His enemies will I clothe with shame: but on himself shall his crown flourish.

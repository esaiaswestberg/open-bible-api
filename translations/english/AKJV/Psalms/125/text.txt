They that trust in the LORD shall be as mount Zion, which cannot be removed, but stays for ever.
As the mountains are round about Jerusalem, so the LORD is round about his people from now on even for ever.
For the rod of the wicked shall not rest on the lot of the righteous; lest the righteous put forth their hands to iniquity.
Do good, O LORD, to those that be good, and to them that are upright in their hearts.
As for such as turn aside to their crooked ways, the LORD shall lead them forth with the workers of iniquity: but peace shall be on Israel.

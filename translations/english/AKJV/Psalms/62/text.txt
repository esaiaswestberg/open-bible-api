Truly my soul waits on God: from him comes my salvation.
He only is my rock and my salvation; he is my defense; I shall not be greatly moved.

My soul, wait you only on God; for my expectation is from him.
He only is my rock and my salvation: he is my defense; I shall not be moved.
In God is my salvation and my glory: the rock of my strength, and my refuge, is in God.
Trust in him at all times; you people, pour out your heart before him: God is a refuge for us. Selah.

God has spoken once; twice have I heard this; that power belongs to God.
Also to you, O Lord, belongs mercy: for you render to every man according to his work.

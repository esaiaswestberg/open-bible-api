Do you indeed speak righteousness, O congregation? do you judge uprightly, O you sons of men?
Yes, in heart you work wickedness; you weigh the violence of your hands in the earth.
The wicked are estranged from the womb: they go astray as soon as they be born, speaking lies.
Their poison is like the poison of a serpent: they are like the deaf adder that stops her ear;
Which will not listen to the voice of charmers, charming never so wisely.
Break their teeth, O God, in their mouth: break out the great teeth of the young lions, O LORD.
Let them melt away as waters which run continually: when he bends his bow to shoot his arrows, let them be as cut in pieces.
As a snail which melts, let every one of them pass away: like the untimely birth of a woman, that they may not see the sun.
Before your pots can feel the thorns, he shall take them away as with a whirlwind, both living, and in his wrath.
The righteous shall rejoice when he sees the vengeance: he shall wash his feet in the blood of the wicked.
So that a man shall say, Truly there is a reward for the righteous: truly he is a God that judges in the earth.

The book of the generation of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham.
Abraham was the father of Isaac; and Isaac was the father of Jacob; and Jacob was the father of Judas and his brothers;
And Judas was the father of Phares and Zara of Thamar; and Phares was the father of Esrom; and Esrom was the father of Aram;
And Aram was the father of Aminadab; and Aminadab was the father of Naasson; and Naasson was the father of Salmon;
And Salmon was the father of Booz of Rachab; and Booz was the father of Obed of Ruth; and Obed was the father of Jesse;
And Jesse was the father of David the king; and David the king was the father of Solomon of her that had been the wife of Urias;
And Solomon was the father of Roboam; and Roboam was the father of Abia; and Abia was the father of Asa;
And Asa was the father of Josaphat; and Josaphat was the father of Joram; and Joram was the father of Ozias;
And Ozias was the father of Joatham; and Joatham was the father of Achaz; and Achaz was the father of Ezekias;
And Ezekias was the father of Manasses; and Manasses was the father of Amon; and Amon was the father of Josias;
And Josias was the father of Jechonias and his brothers, about the time they were carried away to Babylon:
And after they were brought to Babylon, Jechonias was the father of Salathiel; and Salathiel was the father of Zorobabel;
And Zorobabel was the father of Abiud; and Abiud was the father of Eliakim; and Eliakim was the father of Azor;
And Azor was the father of Sadoc; and Sadoc was the father of Achim; and Achim was the father of Eliud;
And Eliud was the father of Eleazar; and Eleazar was the father of Matthan; and Matthan was the father of Jacob;
And Jacob was the father of Joseph the husband of Mary, of whom was born Jesus, who is called Christ.
So all the generations from Abraham to David are fourteen generations; and from David until the carrying away into Babylon are fourteen generations; and from the carrying away into Babylon to Christ are fourteen generations.   ¶
Now the birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise: When as his mother Mary was espoused to Joseph, before they came together, she was found with child of the Holy Ghost.
Then Joseph her husband, being a just man, and not willing to make her a public example, was minded to put her away privately.
But while he thought on these things, behold, the angel of the LORD appeared to him in a dream, saying, Joseph, you son of David, fear not to take to you Mary your wife: for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost.
And she shall bring forth a son, and you shall call his name JESUS: for he shall save his people from their sins.
Now all this was done, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet, saying,
Behold, a virgin shall be with child, and shall bring forth a son, and they shall call his name Emmanuel, which being interpreted is, God with us.
Then Joseph being raised from sleep did as the angel of the Lord had bidden him, and took to him his wife:
And knew her not till she had brought forth her firstborn son: and he called his name JESUS.

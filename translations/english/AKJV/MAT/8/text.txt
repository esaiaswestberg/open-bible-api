When he was come down from the mountain, great multitudes followed him.
And, behold, there came a leper and worshipped him, saying, Lord, if you will, you can make me clean.
And Jesus put forth his hand, and touched him, saying, I will; be you clean. And immediately his leprosy was cleansed.
And Jesus says to him, See you tell no man; but go your way, show yourself to the priest, and offer the gift that Moses commanded, for a testimony to them.   ¶
And when Jesus was entered into Capernaum, there came to him a centurion, beseeching him,
And saying, Lord, my servant lies at home sick of the palsy, grievously tormented.
And Jesus says to him, I will come and heal him.
The centurion answered and said, Lord, I am not worthy that you should come under my roof: but speak the word only, and my servant shall be healed.
For I am a man under authority, having soldiers under me: and I say to this man, Go, and he goes; and to another, Come, and he comes; and to my servant, Do this, and he does it.
When Jesus heard it, he marveled, and said to them that followed, Truly I say to you, I have not found so great faith, no, not in Israel.
And I say to you, That many shall come from the east and west, and shall sit down with Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, in the kingdom of heaven.
But the children of the kingdom shall be cast out into outer darkness: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
And Jesus said to the centurion, Go your way; and as you have believed, so be it done to you. And his servant was healed in the selfsame hour.   ¶
And when Jesus was come into Peter’s house, he saw his wife’s mother laid, and sick of a fever.
And he touched her hand, and the fever left her: and she arose, and ministered to them.   ¶
When the even was come, they brought to him many that were possessed with devils: and he cast out the spirits with his word, and healed all that were sick:
That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Isaiah the prophet, saying, Himself took our infirmities, and bore our sicknesses.   ¶
Now when Jesus saw great multitudes about him, he gave commandment to depart to the other side.
And a certain scribe came, and said to him, Master, I will follow you wherever you go.
And Jesus says to him, The foxes have holes, and the birds of the air have nests; but the Son of man has not where to lay his head.
And another of his disciples said to him, Lord, suffer me first to go and bury my father.
But Jesus said to him, Follow me; and let the dead bury their dead.   ¶
And when he was entered into a ship, his disciples followed him.
And, behold, there arose a great tempest in the sea, so that the ship was covered with the waves: but he was asleep.
And his disciples came to him, and awoke him, saying, Lord, save us: we perish.
And he says to them, Why are you fearful, O you of little faith? Then he arose, and rebuked the winds and the sea; and there was a great calm.
But the men marveled, saying, What manner of man is this, that even the winds and the sea obey him!   ¶
And when he was come to the other side into the country of the Gergesenes, there met him two possessed with devils, coming out of the tombs, exceeding fierce, so that no man might pass by that way.
And, behold, they cried out, saying, What have we to do with you, Jesus, you Son of God? are you come here to torment us before the time?
And there was a good way off from them an herd of many swine feeding.
So the devils sought him, saying, If you cast us out, suffer us to go away into the herd of swine.
And he said to them, Go. And when they were come out, they went into the herd of swine: and, behold, the whole herd of swine ran violently down a steep place into the sea, and perished in the waters.
And they that kept them fled, and went their ways into the city, and told every thing, and what was befallen to the possessed of the devils.
And, behold, the whole city came out to meet Jesus: and when they saw him, they sought him that he would depart out of their coasts.

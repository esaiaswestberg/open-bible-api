O that you were as my brother, that sucked the breasts of my mother! when I should find you without, I would kiss you; yes, I should not be despised.
I would lead you, and bring you into my mother’s house, who would instruct me: I would cause you to drink of spiced wine of the juice of my pomegranate.
His left hand should be under my head, and his right hand should embrace me.
I charge you, O daughters of Jerusalem, that you stir not up, nor awake my love, until he please.
Who is this that comes up from the wilderness, leaning on her beloved? I raised you up under the apple tree: there your mother brought you forth: there she brought you forth that bore you.   ¶
Set me as a seal on your heart, as a seal on your arm: for love is strong as death; jealousy is cruel as the grave: the coals thereof are coals of fire, which has a most vehement flame.
Many waters cannot quench love, neither can the floods drown it: if a man would give all the substance of his house for love, it would utterly be scorned.   ¶
We have a little sister, and she has no breasts: what shall we do for our sister in the day when she shall be spoken for?
If she be a wall, we will build on her a palace of silver: and if she be a door, we will enclose her with boards of cedar.
I am a wall, and my breasts like towers: then was I in his eyes as one that found favor.
Solomon had a vineyard at Baalhamon; he let out the vineyard to keepers; every one for the fruit thereof was to bring a thousand pieces of silver.
My vineyard, which is mine, is before me: you, O Solomon, must have a thousand, and those that keep the fruit thereof two hundred.
You that dwell in the gardens, the companions listen to your voice: cause me to hear it.   ¶
Make haste, my beloved, and be you like to a roe or to a young hart on the mountains of spices.

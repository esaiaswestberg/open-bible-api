O God, you are my God; early will I seek you: my soul thirsts for you, my flesh longs for you in a dry and thirsty land, where no water is;
To see your power and your glory, so as I have seen you in the sanctuary.
Because your loving kindness is better than life, my lips shall praise you.
Thus will I bless you while I live: I will lift up my hands in your name.
My soul shall be satisfied as with marrow and fatness; and my mouth shall praise you with joyful lips:
When I remember you on my bed, and meditate on you in the night watches.
Because you have been my help, therefore in the shadow of your wings will I rejoice.
My soul follows hard after you: your right hand upholds me.
But those that seek my soul, to destroy it, shall go into the lower parts of the earth.
They shall fall by the sword: they shall be a portion for foxes.
But the king shall rejoice in God; every one that swears by him shall glory: but the mouth of them that speak lies shall be stopped.

O god, my heart is fixed; I will sing and give praise, even with my glory.
Awake, psaltery and harp: I myself will awake early.
I will praise you, O LORD, among the people: and I will sing praises to you among the nations.
For your mercy is great above the heavens: and your truth reaches to the clouds.
Be you exalted, O God, above the heavens: and your glory above all the earth;
That your beloved may be delivered: save with your right hand, and answer me.
God has spoken in his holiness; I will rejoice, I will divide Shechem, and mete out the valley of Succoth.
Gilead is mine; Manasseh is mine; Ephraim also is the strength of my head; Judah is my lawgiver;
Moab is my wash pot; over Edom will I cast out my shoe; over Philistia will I triumph.
Who will bring me into the strong city? who will lead me into Edom?
Will not you, O God, who have cast us off? and will not you, O God, go forth with our hosts?
Give us help from trouble: for vain is the help of man.
Through God we shall do valiantly: for he it is that shall tread down our enemies.

I love the LORD, because he has heard my voice and my supplications.
Because he has inclined his ear to me, therefore will I call on him as long as I live.
The sorrows of death compassed me, and the pains of hell got hold on me: I found trouble and sorrow.
Then called I on the name of the LORD; O LORD, I beseech you, deliver my soul.
Gracious is the LORD, and righteous; yes, our God is merciful.
The LORD preserves the simple: I was brought low, and he helped me.
Return to your rest, O my soul; for the LORD has dealt bountifully with you.
For you have delivered my soul from death, my eyes from tears, and my feet from falling.
I will walk before the LORD in the land of the living.
I believed, therefore have I spoken: I was greatly afflicted:
I said in my haste, All men are liars.
What shall I render to the LORD for all his benefits toward me?
I will take the cup of salvation, and call on the name of the LORD.
I will pay my vows to the LORD now in the presence of all his people.
Precious in the sight of the LORD is the death of his saints.
O LORD, truly I am your servant; I am your servant, and the son of your handmaid: you have loosed my bonds.
I will offer to you the sacrifice of thanksgiving, and will call on the name of the LORD.
I will pay my vows to the LORD now in the presence of all his people.
In the courts of the LORD’s house, in the middle of you, O Jerusalem. Praise you the LORD.

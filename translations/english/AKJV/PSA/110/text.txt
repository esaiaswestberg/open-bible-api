The LORD said to my Lord, Sit you at my right hand, until I make your enemies your footstool.
The LORD shall send the rod of your strength out of Zion: rule you in the middle of your enemies.
Your people shall be willing in the day of your power, in the beauties of holiness from the womb of the morning: you have the dew of your youth.
The LORD has sworn, and will not repent, You are a priest for ever after the order of Melchizedek.
The Lord at your right hand shall strike through kings in the day of his wrath.
He shall judge among the heathen, he shall fill the places with the dead bodies; he shall wound the heads over many countries.
He shall drink of the brook in the way: therefore shall he lift up the head.

Judge me, O LORD; for I have walked in my integrity: I have trusted also in the LORD; therefore I shall not slide.
Examine me, O LORD, and prove me; try my reins and my heart.
For your loving kindness is before my eyes: and I have walked in your truth.
I have not sat with vain persons, neither will I go in with dissemblers.
I have hated the congregation of evil doers; and will not sit with the wicked.
I will wash my hands in innocence: so will I compass your altar, O LORD:
That I may publish with the voice of thanksgiving, and tell of all your wondrous works.
LORD, I have loved the habitation of your house, and the place where your honor dwells.
Gather not my soul with sinners, nor my life with bloody men:
In whose hands is mischief, and their right hand is full of bribes.
But as for me, I will walk in my integrity: redeem me, and be merciful to me.
My foot stands in an even place: in the congregations will I bless the LORD.

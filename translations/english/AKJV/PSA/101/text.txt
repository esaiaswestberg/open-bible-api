I will sing of mercy and judgment: to you, O LORD, will I sing.
I will behave myself wisely in a perfect way. O when will you come to me? I will walk within my house with a perfect heart.
I will set no wicked thing before my eyes: I hate the work of them that turn aside; it shall not stick to me.
A fraudulent heart shall depart from me: I will not know a wicked person.
Whoever privately slanders his neighbor, him will I cut off: him that has an high look and a proud heart will not I suffer.
My eyes shall be on the faithful of the land, that they may dwell with me: he that walks in a perfect way, he shall serve me.
He that works deceit shall not dwell within my house: he that tells lies shall not tarry in my sight.
I will early destroy all the wicked of the land; that I may cut off all wicked doers from the city of the LORD.

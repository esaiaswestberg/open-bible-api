The king shall joy in your strength, O LORD; and in your salvation how greatly shall he rejoice!
You have given him his heart’s desire, and have not withheld the request of his lips. Selah.
For you prevent him with the blessings of goodness: you set a crown of pure gold on his head.
He asked life of you, and you gave it him, even length of days for ever and ever.
His glory is great in your salvation: honor and majesty have you laid on him.
For you have made him most blessed for ever: you have made him exceeding glad with your countenance.
For the king trusts in the LORD, and through the mercy of the most High he shall not be moved.
Your hand shall find out all your enemies: your right hand shall find out those that hate you.
You shall make them as a fiery oven in the time of your anger: the LORD shall swallow them up in his wrath, and the fire shall devour them.
Their fruit shall you destroy from the earth, and their seed from among the children of men.
For they intended evil against you: they imagined a mischievous device, which they are not able to perform.
Therefore shall you make them turn their back, when you shall make ready your arrows on your strings against the face of them.
Be you exalted, LORD, in your own strength: so will we sing and praise your power.

God be merciful to us, and bless us; and cause his face to shine on us; Selah.
That your way may be known on earth, your saving health among all nations.
Let the people praise you, O God; let all the people praise you.
O let the nations be glad and sing for joy: for you shall judge the people righteously, and govern the nations on earth. Selah.
Let the people praise you, O God; let all the people praise you.
Then shall the earth yield her increase; and God, even our own God, shall bless us.
God shall bless us; and all the ends of the earth shall fear him.

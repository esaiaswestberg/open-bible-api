Hear my prayer, O LORD, give ear to my supplications: in your faithfulness answer me, and in your righteousness.
And enter not into judgment with your servant: for in your sight shall no man living be justified.
For the enemy has persecuted my soul; he has smitten my life down to the ground; he has made me to dwell in darkness, as those that have been long dead.
Therefore is my spirit overwhelmed within me; my heart within me is desolate.
I remember the days of old; I meditate on all your works; I muse on the work of your hands.
I stretch forth my hands to you: my soul thirsts after you, as a thirsty land. Selah.
Hear me speedily, O LORD: my spirit fails: hide not your face from me, lest I be like to them that go down into the pit.
Cause me to hear your loving kindness in the morning; for in you do I trust: cause me to know the way wherein I should walk; for I lift up my soul to you.
Deliver me, O LORD, from my enemies: I flee to you to hide me.
Teach me to do your will; for you are my God: your spirit is good; lead me into the land of uprightness.
Quicken me, O LORD, for your name’s sake: for your righteousness’ sake bring my soul out of trouble.
And of your mercy cut off my enemies, and destroy all them that afflict my soul: for I am your servant.

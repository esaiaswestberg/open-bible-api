How long will you forget me, O LORD? for ever? how long will you hide your face from me?
How long shall I take counsel in my soul, having sorrow in my heart daily? how long shall my enemy be exalted over me?
Consider and hear me, O LORD my God: lighten my eyes, lest I sleep the sleep of death;
Lest my enemy say, I have prevailed against him; and those that trouble me rejoice when I am moved.
But I have trusted in your mercy; my heart shall rejoice in your salvation.
I will sing to the LORD, because he has dealt bountifully with me.

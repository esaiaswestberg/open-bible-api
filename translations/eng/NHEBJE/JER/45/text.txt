The message that Jeremiah the prophet spoke to Baruch the son of Neriah, when he wrote these words in a book at the mouth of Jeremiah, in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, saying,
"Thus says Jehovah, the God of Israel, to you, Baruch:
'You said, "Woe is me now! For Jehovah has added sorrow to my pain; I am weary with my groaning, and I find no rest."'"
"You shall tell him, 'Thus says Jehovah: "Behold, that which I have built will I break down, and that which I have planted I will pluck up; and this in the whole land.
Do you seek great things for yourself? Do not seek them; for, behold, I will bring disaster on all flesh, says Jehovah; but your life will I give to you for a reward in all places where you go."'"

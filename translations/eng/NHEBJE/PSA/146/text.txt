Praise Yah! Praise Jehovah, my soul.
While I live, I will praise Jehovah. I will sing praises to my God as long as I exist.
Do not put your trust in princes, each a son of man in whom there is no help.
His spirit departs, and he returns to the earth. In that very day, his thoughts perish.
Happy is he who has the God of Jacob for his help, whose hope is in Jehovah, his God:
who made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that is in them; who keeps truth forever;
who executes justice for the oppressed; who gives food to the hungry. Jehovah frees the prisoners.
Jehovah opens the eyes of the blind. Jehovah raises up those who are bowed down. Jehovah loves the righteous.
Jehovah preserves the foreigners. He upholds the fatherless and widow, but the way of the wicked he turns upside down.
Jehovah will reign forever; your God, O Zion, to all generations. Praise Yah!

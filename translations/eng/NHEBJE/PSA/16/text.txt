Preserve me, God, for in you do I take refuge.
My soul, you have said to Jehovah, "You are my Lord. Apart from you I have no good thing."
As for the holy ones who are in the land, they are the excellent ones in whom is all my delight.
Their sorrows shall be multiplied who give gifts to another god. Their drink offerings of blood I will not offer, nor take their names on my lips.
Jehovah assigned my portion and my cup. You made my lot secure.
The lines have fallen to me in pleasant places. Yes, I have a good inheritance.
I will bless Jehovah, who has given me counsel. Yes, my heart instructs me in the night seasons.
I have set Jehovah always before me. Because he is at my right hand, I shall not be moved.
Therefore my heart is glad, and my glory rejoices. My body shall also dwell in safety.
For you will not leave my soul in Sheol, neither will you allow your holy one to see corruption.
You will show me the path of life. In your presence is fullness of joy. In your right hand there are pleasures forevermore.

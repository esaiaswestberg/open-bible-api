You should, however, speak of such subjects as properly have a place in sound Christian teaching.
Teach that the older men should be temperate, serious, and discreet; strong in faith, love, and endurance.
So, too, that the older women should be reverent in their demeanour, and that they should avoid scandal, and beware of becoming slaves to drink;
that they should teach what is right, so as to train the younger women to love their husbands and children,
and to be discreet, pure-minded, domesticated, good women, respecting the authority of their husbands, in order that God’s message may not be maligned.
And so again with the younger men — impress on them the need of discretion.
Above all, set an example of doing good. Show sincerity in your teaching, and a serious spirit;
let the instruction that you give be sound and above reproach, so that the enemy may be ashamed when he fails to find anything bad to say about us.
Tell slaves to respect their owner's authority in all circumstances, and to try their best to please them.
Teach them not to contradict or to pilfer, but to show such praiseworthy fidelity in everything, as to recommend the teaching about God our Saviour by all that they do.
For the loving kindness of God has been revealed, bringing salvation for all;
leading us to renounce irreligious ways and worldly ambitions, and to live discreet, upright, and religious lives here in this present world,
while we are awaiting our blessed hope — the appearing in glory of our great God and Saviour, Christ Jesus.
For he gave himself on our behalf, to deliver us from all wickedness, and to purify for himself a people who should be peculiarly his own and eager to do good.
Speak of all this, and encourage and rebuke with all authority. Do not let anyone despise you.

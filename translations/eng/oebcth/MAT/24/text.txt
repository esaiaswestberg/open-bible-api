Leaving the Temple Courts, Jesus was walking away, when his disciples came up to draw his attention to the Temple buildings.
“Do you see all these things?” was his answer. “I tell you, not a single stone will be left here on another, which will not be thrown down,”
so, while Jesus was sitting on the Mount of Olives, his disciples came up to him privately and said: “Tell us when this will be, and what will be the sign of your coming, and of the close of the age.”
Jesus replied to them: “See that no one leads you astray;

At that time, if anyone should say to you ‘Look! Here is the Christ!’ or ‘Here he is!’, do not believe it;

Therefore, if people say to you ‘He is in the wilderness!’, do not go out there; or ‘He is in an inner room!’, do not believe it;

I tell you that their master will put them in charge of the whole of his property.

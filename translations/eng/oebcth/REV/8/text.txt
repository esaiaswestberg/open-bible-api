As soon as the Lamb had broken the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven for, it might be, half an hour.
Then I saw the seven angels who stand before God, and seven trumpets were given to them.
Next, another angel came and stood at the altar with a golden censer in his hand; and a great quantity of incense was given to him, to mingle with the prayers of all Christ’s people on the golden altar before the throne.
The smoke of the incense ascended, with the prayers of Christ’s people, from the hand of the angel before God.
Then the angel took the censer, and filled it with fire from the altar, and threw it down on the earth; and there followed ‘peals of thunder, cries, flashes of lightning,’ and an earthquake.
Then the seven angels holding the seven trumpets prepared to blow their blasts.
The first blew; and there came hail and fire mixed with blood, and it fell on the earth. A third part of the earth was burnt up, and a third of the trees, and every blade of grass.
Then the second angel blew; and what appeared to be a great mountain, burning, was hurled into the sea. A third of the sea became blood,
and a third part of all created things that are in the sea — that is, of all living things — died, and a third of the ships was destroyed.
Then the third angel blew; and there fell from the heavens a great star, burning like a torch. It fell on a third of the rivers and on the springs.
(The star is called ‘Wormwood.’) A third of the water became bitter as wormwood, and so bitter was the water that many died from drinking it.
Then the fourth angel blew; and a third of the sun and a third of the moon and a third of the stars were blasted, so that a third of them was eclipsed, and for a third part of the day there was no light, and at night it was the same.
And, in my vision, I heard an eagle flying in mid-heaven and crying in a loud voice — ‘Woe, woe, woe for all who live on the earth, at the other trumpet-blasts of the three angels who have yet to blow.’

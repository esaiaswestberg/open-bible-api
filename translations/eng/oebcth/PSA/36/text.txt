Sin whispers within heart of the wicked, who have no dread of God before their eyes.
It flatters them in their eyes that their sin will not be found out.
First, their speech becomes wicked and false, they give up acting wisely and well.
Then they plot deliberate wrong, take their stand on the wicked way, without the least shrinking from evil.
Your love, O Lord, touches the heavens, your faithfulness reaches the clouds.
Your justice is like the great mountains, your judgments are like the broad sea. Lord, you save people and animals.
How precious your love, O God! All may seek shelter in the shadow of your wings.
They feast on the fat of your house, they drink of your brook of delights.
For with you is the fountain of life, in the light that is yours we see light.
O continue your grace to the faithful, your love to the upright in heart.
Let no arrogant foot tread upon me, no wicked hand drive me to exile.
There the workers of wrong lie prostrate, thrust down to rise up no more.

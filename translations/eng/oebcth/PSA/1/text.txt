Happy are those who do not follow the counsel of the wicked, not halting in ways frequented by sinners, nor taking a seat in a gathering of scoffers.
But the law of the Lord is their joy, they study it day and night.
They are like trees planted by runlets of water, yielding fruit in due season, leaves never fading. In all that they do, they prosper.
Not so fare the wicked, not so; like chaff are they, blown by the wind.
So the wicked will not stand firm in the judgment, nor sinners appear, when the righteous are gathered.
For the way of the righteous is dear to the Lord, but the way of the wicked will end in ruin.

Be gracious, O God, be gracious to me, for in you I take shelter. In your sheltering wings I take refuge, till ruin be over past.
I cry to the Most High God, to the God who accomplishes for me.
He will send me his succour from heaven, he will thrust away those who would trample me. (Selah)
In the midst of lions I lie, who devour human prey. Their teeth are spears and arrows, and their tongue is a sharpened sword.
Be exalted, God, o’er the heavens, and your glory o’er all the earth.
They set a net for my feet, but in it was their own foot caught. Before me they dug a pit, but they fell into it themselves. (Selah)
My heart is steadfast, O God, my heart is steadfast. I would sing, I would make music;
awake, my soul. Awake, harp and lyre; I would wake the dawn.
I would praise you among the peoples, O Lord, and make music among the nations to you;
for great to heaven is your love, and your faithfulness to the clouds.
Be exalted, God, o’er the heavens, and your glory o’er all the earth.

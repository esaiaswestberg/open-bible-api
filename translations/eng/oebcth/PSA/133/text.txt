Behold! How good and how pleasant is the dwelling of brothers together!
Like precious oil on the head that ran down on the beard, the beard of Aaron, running over the collar of his robe:
like the dew upon Hermon which falls on the mountains of Zion. For there has the Lord ordained blessing --- life that is endless.

The heavens declare God’s glory, the sky tells what his hands have done.
Day tells it to day, night reveals it to night,
without speaking, without words; without the sound of voices.
But through all the world their voice carries their words to the ends of the earth.    He has set in them a tent for the sun;
like a bridegroom coming forth from his chamber it joyfully runs its course like a hero.
From one end of the heavens it rises, and round it runs to the other, and nothing hides from its heat.
The law of the Lord is perfect, renewing life. The decrees of the Lord are trusty, making simple ones wise.
The behests of the Lord are right, rejoicing the heart. The command of the Lord is pure, giving light to the eyes.
The fear of the Lord is clean, it endures forever. The Lord’s judgments are true and right altogether.
More precious are they than gold --- than fine gold in plenty, and sweeter they are than honey, that drops from the comb.
By them is your servant warned; who keeps them has rich reward.
Who can know their flaws? Absolve me from those who I know not.
Keep your servant from wilful sins --- from falling under their sway: then blameless and clear will I be from great offense.
May the words of my mouth and the thoughts of my heart be pleasing to you, Lord, my rock and redeemer.

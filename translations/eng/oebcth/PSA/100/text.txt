Shout, all the earth, to the Lord. Serve the Lord with gladness, approach him with ringing cries. Be sure that the Lord alone is God. It is he who has made us, and his we are his people, the sheep of his pasture.    Enter his gates with thanksgiving, his courts with praise. Give thanks to him, bless his name. For the Lord is good, his love is forever, and to all ages endures his faithfulness.

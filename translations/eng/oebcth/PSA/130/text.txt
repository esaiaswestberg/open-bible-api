Out of the depths I call to you, Lord.
Lord, hear my voice: give heed with your ears to my loud plea.
If you should mark sin, Lord, O Lord, who could stand?
But with you is forgiveness, that you may be feared.
I wait for the Lord, I wait for his word,
I look for the Lord more than watchman for morning, than watchman for morning.
Israel, hope in the Lord: with the Lord there is love with him plenteous redemption.
And he redeems Israel from all his iniquities.

O my soul, bless the Lord; and all that is in me, his holy name.
O my soul, bless the Lord; and forget not one of his benefits.
He pardons all your sins, he heals all your diseases.
He ransoms your life from the pit, he crowns you with kindness and pity.
He gives you your heart’s desire, renewing your youth like the eagle’s.
The Lord executes justice - and right for all who are wronged.
He revealed his ways to Moses, his acts to the children of Israel.
Full of pity and grace is the Lord, patient, and rich in kindness:
he will not always chide, nor cherish his anger forever.
Not after our sins has he dealt with us, nor requited us after our wickedness.
For high as the heavens o’er the earth is his love over those who fear him.
Far as is east from the west has he put our transgressions from us.
As a father pities his children, so the Lord pities those who fear him;
for well he knows our frame, he remembers that we are dust.
A person's days are as grass; blossoms like a flower of the meadow.
At the breath of the wind it is gone, and the place thereof knows it no more.
But the love of the Lord is eternal, and his kindness to children’s children,
to those who keep his covenant and mindfully do his behests.
The Lord has set his throne in the heavens; the whole world is under his sway.
Bless the Lord, you angels of his, mighty heroes performing his word.
Bless the Lord, all you his hosts, you servants who do his will.
Bless the Lord, all you his works, far as his sway extends. O my soul, bless the Lord.

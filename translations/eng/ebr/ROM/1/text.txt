Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ, a called apostle, separated unto the glad-message of God—
Which he promised beforehand, through his prophets, in holy scriptures—
Concerning his Son,—who came to be of the seed of David, according to flesh,
Who was distinguished as the Son of God—by power, according to a Holy Spirit, through means of a resurrection of the dead,—Jesus Christ our Lord;
Through whom we have received favour and apostleship, for obedience of faith among all the nations, in behalf of his name,
Among whom are, ye also, called of Jesus Christ:
Unto all that are in Rome, beloved of God, called saints, favour unto you, and peace, from God our Father and Lord Jesus Christ.
First, indeed, I give thanks unto my God, through Jesus Christ, concerning you all, because your faith is being announced throughout the whole world.
For God is, my witness,—unto whom I am rendering divine service in my spirit, in the glad message of his Son,—how incessantly, I am making mention of you
At all times in my prayers,—making supplication—if, by some means, even now, at any time, I may have a way opened, in the will of God, to come unto you;
For I am longing to see you, that I may impart some spiritual gift unto you, to the end ye may be established,—
That is to say—there may be a mutual encouragement among you, each by the other’s faith, both yours and mine.
I do not wish however that ye should be ignorant, brethren, that, many times, have I purposed to come unto you, but have been hindered, until the present,—in order that, some fruit, I might have among you also, even as among the other nations,
Both to Greeks and to Barbarians, both to wise and to unwise, a debtor, I am:
Thus, the eagerness on my part—unto you also who are in Rome, to announce the joyful message.
For I am not ashamed of the joyful message; for it is God’s power unto salvation, to every one that believeth, both to Jew [first] and to Greek;
For, a righteousness of God, is therein revealed,—by faith unto faith: even as it is written—But, he that is righteous, by faith, shall live.
For there is being revealed an anger of God from heaven—against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men who, the truth, in unrighteousness, do hold down;—
Inasmuch as, what may be known of God, is manifest among them, for, God, unto them, hath made it manifest,—
For, the unseen things of him, from a world’s creation, by the things made, being perceived, are clearly seen, even his eternal power and divinity,—to the end they should be without excuse;
Inasmuch as, having come to know God, not, as God, did they glorify him, or give him thanks, but were made fruitless in their reasonings, and darkened was their undiscerning heart,
Professing to be wise, they were made foolish,
And, exchanged the glory of the incorruptible God, for the likeness of an image of a corruptible man, and of birds and fourfooted beasts and reptiles:
Wherefore God gave them up in the covetings of their hearts unto impurity, so as to be dishonouring their bodies among them,—
Who, indeed, exchanged away the truth of God for the falsehood, and rendered worship and service unto the creature rather than unto the Creator,—who is blessed unto the ages. Amen!
For this cause, God gave them up unto dishonourable passions; for, even their females, exchanged away the natural use into that which is against nature,—
In like manner also, even the males, leaving the natural use of the female, flamed out in their eager desire one for another, males with males, the indecency, effecting,—and, the necessary recompence of their error, within themselves, duly receiving;—
And, even as they did not approve to be holding, God, in acknowledgment, God gave them up unto a disapproved mind to be doing the things that are not becoming,
Filled with all unrighteousness, wickedness, greed, baseness, full of envy, murder, strife, deceit, evil disposition,
Whisperers, detractors, haters of God, insolent, arrogant, vain boasters, inventors of vices, unto parents unyielding,
Without discernment, regardless of covenants, without natural affection, unmerciful:—
Who, indeed, having acknowledged the righteous sentence of God,—that, they who such things as these do practise, are worthy of death, not only, the same things, are doing, but are even delighting together with them who are practising [them].

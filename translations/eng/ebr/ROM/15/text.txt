We are bound, however, we, who are strong, the weakness of them who are not strong to be bearing, and not, unto ourselves, to give pleasure.
Let, each one of us, unto his neighbour give pleasure—for what is good unto upbuilding;
For, even the Christ, not unto himself gave pleasure, but, even as it is written—The reproaches of them that we reproaching thee, fell upon me:
Whatsoever things, in fact, were written aforetime, [all] for our own instruction were written,—in order that, through endurance and through the encouragement of the Scriptures, we might have their hope.
Now may, the God of the endurance and of the encouragement, give you, the same thing, to be regarding amongst one another, according to Christ Jesus;
In order that, with one accord, with one mouth, ye maybe glorifying the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.
Wherefore receive ye one another, even as, Christ also, hath received us unto the glory of God:—
For I affirm Christ to have become a minister of circumcision in behalf of the truth of God,—to confirm the promises of the fathers,
And that, the nations, for mercy should glorify God:—even as it is written—For this cause, will I openly confess unto thee among nations, and, unto thy name, will strike the strings;
And again he saith—Be glad ye nations with his people;
And again,—Be giving praise all ye nations unto the Lord, and let all the peoples repeat his praise;
And, again, Isaiah, saith—There shall be the root of Jesse, and he that ariseth to rule nations,—upon, him, shall nations hope.
Now, the God of the hope, fill you with all joy and peace in believing, so that ye may surpass in the hope, in the power of Holy Spirit.
But I am persuaded my brethren,—even, I myself, concerning you: that, ye yourselves, also are full of goodness, filled with all knowledge, able also, unto one another, to be ministering admonition:
Howbeit, the more boldly, have I written unto you,—in some measure, as bringing it back to your minds,—by reason of the favour given unto me from God,—
That I should be a public minister of Christ Jesus unto the nations, doing priestly service with the glad-message of God, in order that the offering up of the nations might prove to be acceptable, being hallowed in Holy Spirit:
I have, therefore, [my] boasting in Christ Jesus in the things pertaining to God,—
For I wilt not dare to speak anything save of the things which Christ hath wrought out for himself through me for the obedience of nations,—by word and deed,
By the power of signs and wonders, by the power of [Holy Spirit]; so that I, from Jerusalem and in a circuit as far as Illyricum, have fulfilled the glad-message of the Christ,—
Although, thus,—as ambitious to be announcing the glad-message—not where Christ had been named, lest, upon another’s foundation, I should be building;
But, even as it is written—They shall see unto whom had been announced no tidings concerning him, and, they who had not heard, shall understand.
Wherefore, also, I have been hindered these many times from coming unto you;
But, now, no longer having place in these regions, and having had, a longing, to come unto you a good many years,—
As soon as I am journey to Spain,—I am hoping, in fact, when journeying through to get sight of you, and by you to be set forward thither,—if, with your company, I have first in some measure been satisfied.
But, now, I am journeying unto Jerusalem, ministering unto the saints;
For Macedonia and Achaia have been well-pleased to make a certain fellowship for the destitute of the saints who are in Jerusalem,—
They have been well-pleased, indeed,—and, their debtors, they are; for, if, with their spiritual things the nations have come into fellowship, they are bound also with their own carnal things to minister publicly unto them.
This, then, having completed, and sealed unto them this fruit, I will come back by you unto Spain:—
And know that, when I come unto you, in the fullness of the blessing of Christ, I shall come.
I beseech you, moreover, [brethren], through our Lord Jesus Christ, and through the love of the Spirit, to strive together with me in your prayers on my behalf unto God,—
In order that I may be delivered from them who do not yield in Judaea, and, my ministry which is unto Jerusalem, may prove to be acceptable unto the saints;
In order that, with joy coming unto you through God’s will, I may together with you find rest.
Now, the God of peace, be with you all. Amen.

Vindicate me, O God, and plead my cause, Against a nation, without lovingkindness, From the man of deceit and perversity, wilt thou deliver me?
For, thou, art my defending God—Wherefore hast thou rejected me? Wherefore in gloom should I wander, because of the oppression of an enemy?
Send forth thy light and thy faithfulness, Let, them, lead me, Let them bring me into thy holy mountain, and into thy habitations:
That I may go in unto the altar of God, Unto GOD, mine exultant joy,—That I may praise thee with the lyre, O God—mine own God!
Why shouldst thou be cast down, O my soul? And why shouldst thou moan over me, Wait thou for God, for yet shall I praise him, As the triumph of my presence, and my God.

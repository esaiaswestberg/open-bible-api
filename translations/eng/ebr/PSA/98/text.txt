Sing to Yahweh, a song that is new, For, wonderful things, hath he done, His own right hand and his holy arm, have brought him salvation.
Yahweh, hath made known, his salvation, Before the eyes of the nations, hath he revealed his righteousness;
He hath remembered his lovingkindness and his faithfulness towards the house of Israel,—All the ends of the earth, have seen, the salvation of our God.
Shout aloud to Yahweh, all the earth, Break forth and make a joyful noise and sweep the strings;
Sweep the strings to Yahweh, With the lyre, With the lyre, and the voice of melody;
With trumpets and the sound of a horn, Shout aloud, before the king—Yahweh.
Let the sea, roar, and the fulness thereof, The world, and they who dwell therein;
Let, the floods, clap their hands, Together, let, the mountains, make a joyful noise,
Before Yahweh, for he is coming—to judge the earth,—He will judge the world, in righteousness, And the peoples, with equity.

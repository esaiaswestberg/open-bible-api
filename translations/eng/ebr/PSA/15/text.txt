O Yahweh! Who shall be a guest in thy tent? Who shall abide in thy holy mountain?
He that walketh without blame, and doeth what is right, and speaketh truth with his heart;
Hath not carried slander on his tongue, hath not done his friend a wrong, nor, a reproach, taken up against his neighbour;
Despised in his sight, is the reprobate, but, them who revere Yahweh, he doth honour, he hath sworn to his neighbour, and will not change;
His silver, hath he not put out on interest, nor, a bribe against the innocent, hath he taken. He that doeth these things, shall not be shaken unto times age-abiding.

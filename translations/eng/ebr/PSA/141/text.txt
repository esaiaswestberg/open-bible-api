O Yahweh, I have cried unto thee, Make thou haste to me, Give ear unto my voice, when I cry to thee.
Let my prayer be set in order like incense before thee,—the lifting up of my hands, as the evening gift.
Set thou, O Yahweh, a watch at my mouth, Keep thou guard over the door of my lips.
Let not my heart incline to a matter of wrong, that I should busy myself with practices in lawlessness, with men working iniquity, and let me not eat of their dainties.
Let a righteous man smite me—a lovingkindness, that he should correct me, an oil for the head [which] let not my head refuse! For, yet, even my prayer, shall be in their calamities.
Their judges, have been hurled down by a crag, Now have men heard my sayings, for they have become sweet.
As when one plougheth and furroweth the earth, Scattered about, are our bones at the mouth of hades!
Surely, unto thee, O Yahweh, My Lord, are mine eyes, In thee, have I sought refuge, Do not pour out my life.
Keep me out of the clutches of the trap they have set for me, and the snares of the workers of iniquity.
They who are lawless, shall fall into the nooses thereof, while, I, at the same time, pass on.

How long, O Yahweh, wilt thou wholly forget me? How long wilt thou hide thy face from me?
How long shall I lay up cares within my soul, sorrow in my heart, day by day? How long shall mine enemy lift himself up over me?
Have regard! answer me O Yahweh my God,—Light up mine eyes, lest I sleep on into death:
Lest mine enemy say, I have prevailed over him! and, mine adversaries, exult, that I totter.
But, I, in thy lovingkindness, have put my trust, My heart shall exult in thy salvation:
I will sing to Yahweh, for he hath dealt beautifully with me.

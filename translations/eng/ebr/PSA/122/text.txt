I was glad, when they were saying unto me, Unto the house of Yahweh, let us go!
Standing are our feet, within thy gates, O Jerusalem!
Jerusalem! that hath been builded, A true city, all joined together as one:
Whither have come up the tribes, The tribes of Yah, A testimony to Israel, To give thanks unto the Name of Yahweh:
For there are set—Thrones for justice, Thrones for the house David.
Ask ye for the peace of Jerusalem, They shall prosper, who love thee!
Peace be within thy walls, prosperity within thy palaces:
For the sake of my brethren and friends, Oh, might I speak [saying], Peace be within thee!
For the sake of the house of Yahweh our God, will I seek blessing for thee.

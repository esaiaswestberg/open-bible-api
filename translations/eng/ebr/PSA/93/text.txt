Yahweh, hath become king, With majesty, is he clothed,—Clothed is Yahweh, With strength, hath he girded himself, Surely he hath fixed the world, It shall not be shaken.
Established hath been thy throne from of old, From age-past times, thou art.
The floods have lifted up, O Yahweh, The floods have lifted up—their voice, The floods have lifted up—their dashing waves.
With the sounds of many waters, Majestic are the breakers of the sea, Majestic on high, is Yahweh.
Thy testimonies, are strongly confirmed, To thy house, befitting is holiness, O Yahweh—to length of days.

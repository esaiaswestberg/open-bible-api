Praise ye Yah! Praise, O ye servants of Yahweh, Praise the Name of Yahweh;
Be the Name of Yahweh blessed, henceforth, even to times age-abiding.
From the rising of the sun unto the going in thereof, Worthy to be praised, is the Name of Yahweh:
High above all nations, is Yahweh, Above the heavens, his glory.
Who is like Yahweh our God? that goeth on high to dwell,
That cometh down low to look, through the heavens and through the earth;
That raiseth, out of the dust, the poor, From the dunghill, uplifteth the needy;
To give a seat with nobles, with the nobles of his people!
Causing the barren woman to dwell in a household, A mother of sons in her joy! Praise ye Yah.

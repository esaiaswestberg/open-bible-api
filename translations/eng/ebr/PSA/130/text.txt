Out of the depths, have I cried unto thee, O Yahweh.
O My Lord! hearken thou unto my voice,—Let thine ears be attentive to the voice of my supplications,
If, iniquities, thou shouldest mark, O Yah, O My Lord, who could stand?
But, with thee, is forgiveness, that thou mayest be revered.
I have waited for Yahweh, My soul hath waited for his word;
I have hoped, O my soul, for My Lord, more than they who watch for the morning, who watch for the morning.
Wait, O Israel, for Yahweh,—for, with Yahweh, is lovingkindness, and there aboundeth with him—redemption.
He, therefore, will redeem Israel from all his iniquities.

Yahweh, hath become king, Let the peoples, tremble, He is enthroned on the cherubim, Let the earth, shake.
Yahweh, in Zion, is great, And, high, is he over all the peoples.
Let them thank his Name—great and reverend, Holy, is he!
Yea, with the strength of a king—justice, he loveth,—Thou, hast established equity, Justice and righteousness in Jacob, thou, hast wrought.
Exalt Yahweh our God, And bow down at his footstool, Holy, is he!
Moses and Aaron, [were] among his priests, And, Samuel, [was] among them who were calling upon his Name, Who were calling upon Yahweh, and, he, used to answer them:
In the pillar of cloud, used he to speak unto them, They kept his testimonies, and the statute he gave them.
O Yahweh our God! thou, answeredst them,—A pardoning GOD, thou becamest to them, Yet one bringing vengeance on their deeds.
Exalt Yahweh our God, And bow down towards his holy mountain, For, holy, is Yahweh our God.

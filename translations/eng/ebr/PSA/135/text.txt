Praise ye Yah, Praise ye the Name of Yahweh, Praise, O ye servants of Yahweh;
Who stand In the house of Yahweh, In the courts of the house of our God.
Praise ye Yah, For good is Yahweh, Sing praises to his Name, For it is full of delight;
For, Jacob, hath Yah chosen for himself, Israel, for his own treasure.
For, I, know that great is Yahweh, yea, our Lord, is beyond all gods.
Whatsoever Yahweh hath pleased, he hath done,—in the heavens and on the earth, in the seas, and all resounding deeps:
Causing vapours to ascend from the end of the earth,—Lightnings for the rain, hath he made, bringing forth wind out of his treasuries.
Who smote the firstborn of Egypt, both of man, and of beast;
Sent signs and wonders into thy midst, O Egypt, upon Pharaoh, and upon all his servants.
Who smote great nations, and slew mighty kings:
Sihon, king of the Amorites, and Og, king of Bashan, and all the kingdoms of Canaan;
And gave their land as an inheritance, an inheritance to Israel his people.
O Yahweh! thy Name, is age-abiding,—O Yahweh! thy memorial, is to generation after generation.
For Yahweh will vindicate his people,—and, on his servants, have compassion.
The idols of the nations, are silver and gold, the work of the hands of men:
A mouth, have they, but they speak not, Eyes, have they, but they see not;
Ears, have they, but they hear not, Nose,—there is no breath in their mouth.
Like unto them, shall be they who make them, every one who trusteth in them.
O house of Israel! bless Yahweh, O house of Aaron! bless Yahweh;
O house of Levi! bless Yahweh, Ye that revere Yahweh! bless Yahweh.
Blessed be Yahweh out of Zion, Who inhabiteth Jerusalem, Praise ye Yah!

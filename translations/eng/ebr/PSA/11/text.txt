In Yahweh, have I sought refuge. How can ye say to my soul, Flee to a mountain like a little bird;
For lo! the lawless, bend the bow They have fixed their arrow upon the string, To shoot in the darkness at the upright in heart:
When the pillars are overthrown, What could, a righteous man, do?
Yahweh, is in his holy temple As for Yahweh, in the heavens, is his throne, His eyes, behold—His eyelashes test the sons of men.
Yahweh, putteth, the righteous, to the test,—But the lawless one and the lover of violence, his soul doth hate.
He will rain upon the lawless live-coals, Fire and brimstone and a burning wind, are the portion of their cup.
For righteous is Yahweh Righteousness, he loveth, the upright, shall behold his face.

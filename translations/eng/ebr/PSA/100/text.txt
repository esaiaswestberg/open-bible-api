Make a joyful noise to Yahweh, all the earth:
Serve Yahweh with rejoicing, Enter before him, with shouts of triumph.
Know that, Yahweh, he, is God,—He, made us, and not, we ourselves, His people, and the flock of his pasture.
Enter ye his gates, with thanksgiving, his courts, with praise, Give ye thanks to him, bless ye his Name;
For good is Yahweh, Age-abiding is his lovingkindness, And, unto generation after generation, his faithfulness.

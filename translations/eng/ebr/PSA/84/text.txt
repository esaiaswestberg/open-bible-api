How lovely are thy habitations, O Yahweh of hosts!
My soul, longeth—yea even languisheth—for the courts of Yahweh,—My heart and my flesh, shout aloud for a Living GOD.
Even the sparrow, hath found a home, And, the swallow, a nest for herself, where she hath laid her young, Thine altars, O Yahweh of hosts, My king and my God!
How happy are they who abide in thy house,—Still are they praising thee. [Selah.]
How happy the men whose strength is in thee, Festive processions are in their heart.
Passing through the balsam-vale, A place of fountains, they make it, Yea, with blessings, is it covered by the early rain.
They go from strength to strength, Each one appeareth before God in Zion.
O Yahweh, God of hosts, hear thou my prayer,—Give hear, thou God of Jacob. [Selah.]
Our Shield, behold thou, O God, And look upon the face of thine Anointed One.
For better is a day in thy courts, than a thousand, I choose rather to stand at the threshold in the house of my God, Than to dwell in the tents of lawlessness.
For, a sun and shield, is Yahweh God,—Grace and glory, will Yahweh give, He will not withhold what is good, from them who walk without blame.
O Yahweh of hosts! How happy the man who trusteth in thee!

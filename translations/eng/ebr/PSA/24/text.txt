To Yahweh, belongeth, The earth and the fulness thereof, The world, and they who dwell therein;
For, he, upon the seas, hath founded it, and upon the currents, doth make it firm.
Who shall ascend the mountain of Yahweh? And who shall stand in his holy place?
The clean of hands, and pure of heart,—who hath not uplifted, to falsehood, his soul, nor sworn deceitfully,
Shall bear away a blessing from Yahweh, and righteousness, from his delivering God.
This, is the generation of them who inquire of him, who seek thy face, O God of Jacob. [Selah.]
Lift up, O ye gates, your heads, and lift yourselves up, ye age-abiding doors, That the king of glory may come in.
Who is the king of glory? Yahweh, strong and mighty, Yahweh, mighty in war.
Lift up, O ye gates, your heads, yea lift [them] up, ye age-abiding doors, That the king of glory may come in.
Who then is the king of glory? Yahweh of hosts, He, is the king of glory. [Selah.]

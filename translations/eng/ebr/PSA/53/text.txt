The impious hath said in his heart, There is no God! They have acted corruptly, They have wrought abominable perversity, There is none that doeth good:—
God, out of the heavens, looked down upon the sons of men,—To see whether there was one that showed wisdom, Enquiring after God.
They all, have turned back, together have they become tainted,—There is none that doeth good, Not so much as, one!
Are the workers of iniquity, without knowledge? Devouring my people, [as] they devour food? Upon God, have they not called.
There have they been in great dread where no dread was, Because, God, hath scattered the bones of thy besieger,—Thou hast put [him] to shame, Because, God, had, rejected, them.
Oh that, out of Zion, were granted the salvations of Israel! When God bringeth back the captives of his people, Jacob, shall exult, Israel, shall be glad.

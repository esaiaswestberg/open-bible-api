Thine, are silence [and] praise, O God, in Zion,—And, to thee, shall be paid the vow.
Thou hearer of prayer! Unto thee, shall all flesh come.
Iniquitous things, have been too strong for me, As for our transgressions, wilt, thou, by propitiation remove them.
How happy the man thou shalt choose and bring near! He shall abide in thy courts,—We shall be satisfied with, The blessing of thy house, The holiness of thy temple.
By things reverend in righteousness, wilt thou answer us, O God of our salvation, The confidence of all the ends of the earth, And of the sea far away;
Who setteth fast the mountains by his strength, Being girded with might;
Who stilleth, The noise of the seas, The noise of their rolling waves, and The tumult of races of men?
Yea the dwellers in the uttermost parts have feared at thy tokens, The goings forth of morning and evening, thou causest to shout for joy.
Thou hast visited the earth, and made it abound, Abundantly, dost thou enrich it—The channel of God, is full of waters, Thou preparest their corn, Yea, thus, dost thou prepare it:
The ridges thereof, drenching, Settling the furrows thereof, With myriad drops, dost thou soften it, The sprouting thereof, doth thou bless.
Thou hast set a crown upon thy year of bounty, And, thy tracks, drop fatness;
Fruitful are the pastures of the wilderness, And, with exultation, the hills do gird themselves.
Clothed are the pastures with flocks, The valleys also, cover themselves with corn, They shout for joy, yea they sing.

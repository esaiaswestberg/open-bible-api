God is, known in Judah, In Israel, great is his Name;
Now hath come into Salem, his pavilion, And his dwelling-place into Zion.
There, hath he broken in pieces the arrows of the bow, shield and sword, and battle. [Selah.]
Enveloped in light, thou, art more majestic than the mountains of prey.
The valiant of heart have become a spoil, They have slumbered their sleep, And none of the men of might have found their hands.
At thy rebuke, O God of Jacob, Stunned are the horsemen.
As for thee, to be feared thou art! Who then shall stand before thee, because of the power of thine anger?
Out of the heavens, didst thou cause judgment to be heard, Earth, feared and was still:
When God rose up to judgment, To save all the oppressed of the earth. [Selah.]
For the multitude of mankind shall give thanks unto thee, The remainder of the multitude, shall keep holy festival unto thee.
Vow and pay, unto Yahweh your God,—Let, all who are round about him, bear along a gift unto him who is to be revered.
He cutteth off the spirit of nobles, he is of reverend majesty to the kings of the earth.

If it had not been, Yahweh, who was on our side, oh might Israel say:
If it had not been, Yahweh, who was on our side, when men rose up against us,
Then, alive, had they swallowed us up, in the glow of their anger against us;
Then, the waters, had whelmed us, the torrent, gone over our soul;
Then, had gone over our soul the waters so proud!
Blessed, be Yahweh, who gave us not as prey to their teeth.
Our soul, as a bird, hath escaped from the snare of the fowlers, The snare, is broken, and, we, are escaped:
Our help, is in the Name of Yahweh, who made heaven and earth.

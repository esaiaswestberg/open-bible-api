Unto thee, O Yahweh, my soul, would I lift:
O my God, in thee, have I put my trust, Let me not be put to shame, Let not my foe exult over me:
Yea let, none who wait for thee, be put to shame, Let them be put to shame who act covertly without cause!
Thy ways, O Yahweh, let me know, Thy paths, teach thou me:
Guide me into thy truth and teach me, for, thou, art my delivering God, For thee, have I waited all the day:
Remember thy compassions, O Yahweh, and thy lovingkindnesses, For, from age-past times, have they been.
The sins of my youth, and my transgressions, do not thou call to mind,—According to thine own lovingkindness, remember thou me, for the sake of thine own goodness, O Yahweh.
Good and upright, is Yahweh, For this cause, will he direct sinners into the way.
May he guide patient wronged-ones to be righted, and teach such oppressed-ones his way.
All the paths of Yahweh, are lovingkindness and faithfulness, to such as keep his covenant, and his testimonies.
For the sake of thy Name, O Yahweh, Therefore wilt thou pardon mine iniquity, for great it is.
Who then is the man that revereth Yahweh? Let him direct him into the way he should choose.
His soul, with prosperity, shall tarry, and, his seed, shall possess the land.
Intimacy with Yahweh, have they who revere him, His covenant also, he letteth them know.
Mine eyes, are continually unto Yahweh,—for, he, bringeth, out of the net, my feet.
Turn thou unto me, and show me favour, for, alone and oppressed, I am.
The distresses of my heart, hath he relieved,—and, out of my straits, brought me forth.
Behold my humiliation and my pain, and take away all my sins.
Behold my foes, for they abound,—and, with the hatred of violence, do they hate me.
Oh keep my soul, and rescue me, Let me not be put to shame, for I have sought refuge in thee.
Let, blamelessness and uprightness, watch over me, because I have waited for thee.
Redeem Israel, O God,—out of all his distresses.

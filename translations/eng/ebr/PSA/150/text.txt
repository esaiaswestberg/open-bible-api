Praise ye Yah, Praise ye GOD in his sanctuary, Praise him, in his strong expanse:
Praise him, for his mighty deeds, Praise him, according to his exceeding greatness:
Praise him, with the blast of a horn, Praise him, with the harp and lyre:
Praise him, with timbrel and dance,—Praise him, with stringed instrument and flute,
Praise him, with cymbals of clear tone,—Praise him, with cymbals of loud clang:
Let, every breathing thing, praise Yah, Praise ye Yah!

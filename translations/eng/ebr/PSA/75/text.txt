We have given thanks unto thee, O God, we have given thanks, And, in calling upon thy Name, men have recounted thy wonders.
Surely I will take a set time,—I, with equity, will judge:
Earth was melting away with all its inhabitants, I, have fixed the pillars thereof. [Selah.]
I have said to the boasters, Do not boast, And to the lawless, Do not lift up a horn;
Do not lift up on high your horn, Nor speak of the Rock, with arrogance;
For neither from east nor west, Nor from the wilderness of the mountains [cometh exaltation] ;
For, God himself, is about to judge, One, he will cast down, Another, he will lift up;
For, a cup, is in the hand of Yahweh, Whose wine is foaming, It is full of spiced wine, Which he hath caused to flow from one to another,—Surely, the dregs thereof, they shall drain out—they shall drink, Even all the lawless ones of the earth.
But, I, will exult unto times age-abiding, I will sing praises unto the God of Jacob;
But, all the horns of the lawless, will I hew off,—Exalted shall be the horns of the Righteous One.

Thou hast accepted, O Yahweh, thy land, Thou hast brought back the captives of Jacob;
Thou hast taken away, the iniquity of thy people, Thou hast covered, all their sin. [Selah.]
Thou hast withdrawn all thine indignation, Thou hast ceased from the glow of thine anger.
Restore us, O God of our salvation, And take away thy vexation towards us.
To times age-abiding, wilt thou be angry with us? Wilt thou prolong thine anger, from generation to generation?
Wilt not, thou thyself, again give us life, That, thy people, may rejoice in thee.
Show us, O Yahweh, thy lovingkindness, And, thy salvation, wilt thou grant us.
I will hear, what GOD—Yahweh—will speak,—For he will bespeak prosperity to his people, And to his men of lovingkindness, And to them who return with their heart unto him.
Surely, near unto them who revere him, is his salvation, That the Glory, may settle down, in our land.
Lovingkindness and faithfulness, have met together, Righteousness and prosperity, have kissed each other;
Faithfulness, out of the earth, doth spring forth, And, righteousness, out of the heavens, hath looked down.
Yahweh himself too, will give us the blessing, And, our land, shall yield her increase.
Righteousness, before him, shall march long,—That he may make, into a way, the steps of its feet.

Great is Yahweh, and worthy to be mightily praised, In the city of our God, His holy mountain.
Beautiful in elevation, the joy of all the land, Is Mount Zion, in the recesses of the north,—The city of a great king.
God, in her palaces, is to be known as a high tower.
For lo! Kings—Met as appointed, Passed by together;
They themselves, saw, So, were they amazed, Dismayed—they hurried way!
Trembling, seized them, there, Pangs. like hers who is in travail.
With an east wind, wilt thou shatter the ships of Tarshish.
Just as we have heard, So, have we seen, In the city of Yahweh of hosts, In the city of our God, God himself, will establish her, unto times age-abiding. [Selah.]
We have thought, O God, upon thy lovingkindness, In the midst of thy temple:
According to thy Name, O God, So, be thy praise, unto the ends of the earth, With righteousness, is, thy right hand, filled.
Let Mount Zion rejoice, Let the daughters of Judah exult, Because of thy judgments.
Go round Zion, and compass her about, Reckon up her towers;
Apply your mind to her rampart, Pass between her palaces, That ye may recount them to an after generation;
For, this God, is our God, to times age-abiding and beyond, He himself, will conduct us till death.

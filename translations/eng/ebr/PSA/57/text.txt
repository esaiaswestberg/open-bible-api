Show me favour, O God, Show me favour, For, in thee, hath my soul sought refuge,—And, in the shadow of thy wings, will I seek refuge, Until the storm of ruin pass by.
I will cry unto God Most High, Unto GOD, who accomplisheth on my behalf:
He will send out of heaven, that he may save me, He who is panting for me, hath reproached. [Selah.] God will send out his lovingkindness and his faithfulness.
My soul, is in the midst of lions, I lie down amidst flames, As for the sons of men, Their teeth, are spear and arrows, And, their tongue, is a sharp sword.
Be exalted Above the Heavens, O God, Above all the earth, thy glory!
A net, did they fix for my steps, My soul was bowed down,—They digged before me a pit, They fell into the midst thereof! [Selah.]
Fixed is my heart, O God, Fixed is my heart, I will sing, and touch the strings.
Awake, mine honour, Awake, harp and lyre, I will awaken the dawn;
I will thank thee, among the peoples, O My Lord, I will praise thee in song, among the races of men.
For, great, unto the heavens, is thy lovingkindness, And, unto the skies, thy faithfulness.
Be exalted Above the heavens, O God, Above all the earth, thy glory!

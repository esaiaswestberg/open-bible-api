When Israel came forth out of Egypt, The house of Jacob from among a people of strange tongue,
Judah became his sanctuary, Israel his realm:
The sea, beheld, and fled, The Jordan, turned back;
The mountains, started like rams, The hills like the young of the flock?
What aileth thee, O sea, that thou fleest? O Jordan, that thou turnest back?
Ye mountains, that ye start like rams? Ye hills, like the young of the flock?
Before the Lord, be in anguish, O earth, Before the GOD of Jacob:
Who turneth The Rock into a pool of water, The Flint into springs of water.

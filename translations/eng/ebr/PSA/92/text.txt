It is good to give thanks to Yahweh, And to sing praises unto thy Name, O Most High;
To declare, in the morning, thy lovingkindness, And thy faithfulness at night;
Upon an instrument of ten strings, and upon a harp, With resounding music on the lyre.
For thou hast made me glad, O Yahweh, in thy doing, In the works of thy hands, will I shout for joy.
How great have grown thy works, Yahweh, [How] very deep are laid thy plans!
A man that is brutish, cannot know, And, a dullard, cannot discern this:—
When the lawless do thrive like grass, And all the workers of iniquity have blossomed, It is that they may be destroyed for ever.
But, thou, shalt be on high age-abidingly, O Yahweh.
For lo! thine enemies, Yahweh, For lo! thine enemies, shall perish, They shall be scattered—all the workers of iniquity;
But thou wilt exalt, as [those of] the buffalo, my horn, I have been anointed, with fresh oil.
So hath mine eye descried them who were lying in wait for me,—Of my wicked assailants, mine ears, shall hear.
The righteous, like the palm-tree, shall thrive, Like the cedar in Lebanon, shall he grow;
They who are planted in the house of Yahweh, In the courts of our God, shall flourish;
Still shall they bear fruit in old age, Vigorous and fresh, shall they be:
To declare that upright is Yahweh, My Rock, and no perversity in him.

O God! by thine own Name, save me, And, by thine own strength, wilt thou vindicate me?
O God! Hear my prayer, Give ear to the sayings of my mouth;
For, aliens, have risen up against me, And, men of violence, have sought my life, They have not set God before them. [Selah.]
Lo! God, is bringing me help, My Lord, is with the upholders of my life;
Let him turn back the mischief upon mine adversaries, In thy faithfulness, destroy them!
With a freewill-offering, will I sacrifice unto thee, I will praise thy Name, O Yahweh, for it is good;
For, out of all distress, hath he rescued me,—And, upon my foes, hath, mine own eye, looked.

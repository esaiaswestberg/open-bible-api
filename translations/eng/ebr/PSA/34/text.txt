Let me bless Yahweh at all times, Continually be his praise in my mouth.
In Yahweh, boasteth my soul, The patient oppressed-ones shall hear and be glad.
Ascribe ye greatness unto Yahweh with me, and let us exalt his Name together.
I enquired of Yahweh, and he hath answered me, And, out of all my terrors, hath he rescued me.
They looked unto him and were radiant, And, as for their faces, let them not be abashed.
This, oppressed one cried, and, Yahweh, heard—and, out of all his distresses, saved him.
The messenger of Yahweh encampeth around them who revere him, Thus hath he delivered them.
Oh taste and see, that good is Yahweh,—How happy the man who seeketh refuge in him!
Revere Yahweh, ye his holy ones, For there is no want to them who revere him.
Young lions, have come short, and suffered hunger, but, they who seek Yahweh, shall not lack any good thing.
Come, ye children! hearken unto me, The reverence of Yahweh, will I teach you.
Who is the man that desireth life, Loving days, that he may see good?
Keep thy tongue from wickedness, And thy lips from speaking deceit:
Depart from wickedness and do good, Aim at well-being, and pursue it.
The eyes of Yahweh, are towards the righteous, And, his ears, towards their cry for help:
the face of Yahweh, is against such as do wickedness, To cut off, from the earth, their memory.
They made outcry, and Yahweh heard, And, out of all their straits, hath he rescued them.
Near is Yahweh, to the broken in heart, And, the crushed in spirit, will he save.
Many are the misfortunes of the righteous, But, out of them all, doth Yahweh rescue him.
Keeping all his bones, Not, one from among them, is broken.
Misfortune shall be the death of the lawless one, And, the haters of the righteous man, shall be held guilty.
Yahweh ransometh the soul of his servants, And none shall be held guilty, who seek refuge in him.

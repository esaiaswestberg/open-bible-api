And it came to pass, on the day when Moses made an end of rearing up the habitation and anointing it, and hallowing it, and all the furniture thereof, and the altar, and all the utensils thereof,—both of anointing them, and hallowing them,
that the princes of Israel, the heads of their ancestral houses, made an offering,—they being princes of the tribes, they being the men who stood over them who were numbered:
yea then brought they in as their offering, before Yahweh—six covered waggons, and twelve oxen, a waggon for every two of the princes and an ox for each one,—yea they brought them near before the habitation.
Then spake Yahweh unto Moses, saying:
Take [them] of them, so shall they be for doing the laborious work of the tent of meeting,—and thou shalt give them unto the Levites, to every man according to the need of his laborious work.
So Moses took the waggons, and the oxen,—and gave them unto the Levites:
two of the waggons and four of the oxen, gave he unto the sons of Gershon,—according to the need of their laborious work;
and four of the waggons, and eight of the oxen, gave he unto the sons of Merari,—according to the need of their laborious work, in the hand of Ithamar son of Aaron the priest;
but, unto the sons of Kohath, gave he none,—because as to the laborious work of the sanctuary which pertained unto them, upon their shoulders, were they to carry it.
So then the princes offered for the dedication of the altar, on the day it was anointed,—yea the princes offered their oblation before the altar,
And Yahweh said unto Moses: Each prince on his appointed day, thus shall they offer their oblation, for the dedication of the altar.

And I saw another, a mighty messenger, descending out of heaven,—arrayed with a cloud, and, the rainbow, was upon his head, and, his face, was as the sun, and, his feet, were as pillars of fire,
and [he was] holding in his hand a little scroll, opened; and he set his right foot upon the sea, and his left upon the land,
and cried out with a loud voice, just as a lion, roareth. And, when he cried out, the seven thunders uttered their own voices.
And, when the seven thunders had spoken, I was about to write, and I heard a voice out of heaven, saying—Seal up the things which the seven thunders have uttered, and do not write, them.
And, the messenger, whom I saw standing upon the sea and upon the land, lifted up his right hand unto heaven,
and sware, by him that liveth unto the ages of ages, who created heaven, and the things that are therein, and the earth, and the things that are therein, [and the sea, and the things that are therein,] Delay, no longer, shall there be;
but, in the days of the sounding of the seventh messenger, as soon as he is about to blow his trumpet, then shall have been completed the sacred secret of God as he told the good-news unto his own servants the prophets.
And, the voice which I had heard out of heaven, [I] again [heard] talking with me; and saying—Go take the opened scroll, that is in the hand of the messenger who is standing upon the sea and upon the land.
And I went away unto the messenger, asking him to give me the little scroll; and he saith unto me—Take it, and eat it up; and it shall embitter thy belly, but, in thy mouth, shall be sweet as honey.
And I took the little scroll out of the hand of the messenger, and did eat it up; and it was, in my mouth, as honey, sweet, and, when I had eaten it, embittered was my belly.
And they say unto me—It behoveth thee again to prophesy against peoples and nations and tongues, and many kings.

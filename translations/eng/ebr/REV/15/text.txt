And I saw another sign in heaven, great and marvellous,—seven messengers having seven plagues, the last, because, in them, was ended the wrath of God.
And I saw as a glassy sea mingled with fire, and them who escape victorious from the beast, and from his image, and from the number of his name, standing upon the glassy sea, having harps of God;
and they sing the song of Moses the servant of God and the song of the Lamb, saying—Great and marvelous, are thy works, Lord, God, the Almighty! Righteous and true, are thy ways, O King of the ages!
Who shall in anywise not be put in fear, O Lord, and glorify thy name,—because, alone, full of lovingkindness; because, all the nations, will have come, and will do homage before thee, because, thy righteous deeds, were made manifest?
And, after these things, I saw, and the sanctuary of The Tent of Witness in heaven, was opened;
And the seven messengers who had the seven plagues, came forth, out of the sanctuary clothed with a [precious] stone, pure, bright, and girt about the breasts with girdles of gold.
And, one of the four living creatures, gave, unto the seven messengers, seven golden bowls, full of the wrath of God who liveth unto the ages of ages.
And the sanctuary was filled with smoke by reason of the glory of God, and by reason of his power; and, no one, was able to enter into the sanctuary, until the seven plagues of the seven messengers should be ended.

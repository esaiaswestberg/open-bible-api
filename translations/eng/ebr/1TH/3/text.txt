Wherefore, no longer concealing our anxiety, we were well-pleased to be left in Athens, alone,
And sent Timothy—our brother, and God’s minister in the glad-message of the Christ—that he might confirm and console you over your faith,
That, no one, might be shrinking back in these tribulations. For ye, yourselves, know, that, hereunto, are we appointed;
For, even when we were with you, we told you beforehand—we are destined to suffer tribulation! even as it also came to pass, and ye know.
For this cause, I also, no longer concealing my anxiety, sent, that I might get to know your faith, lest by any means he that tempteth, should have tempted you, and, in vain, should have been our toil.
But, when, just now, Timothy came unto us, from you, and brought us good tidings of your faith and love,—and that ye have good remembrance of us, continually, longing to see, us,—even as, we also, to see you,
For this cause, were we consoled, brethren, over you, in all our necessity and tribulation, through your faith;
Because, now, we live,—if only, ye, stand fast in the Lord.
For what thanksgiving can we render back, unto God, concerning you, on occasion of all the joy wherewith we rejoice, for your sakes, before our God?—
Night and day, making very abundant entreaties, that we may see your face, and fit in the things which are lacking in your faith?
Now may, our God and Father himself and our Lord Jesus, make straight our way unto you:
And, you, may the Lord cause to abound and excel in your love one toward another, and toward all,—even as, we, do toward you:
To the end he may confirms your hearts, faultless in holiness, before our God and Father, in the Presence of our Lord Jesus with all his saints.

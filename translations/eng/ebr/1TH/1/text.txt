Paul and Silvanus and Timothy—unto the assembly of Thessalonians in God our Father and Lord Jesus Christ,—favour unto you, and peace!
We are giving thanks unto God continually, concerning you all, making, mention, in our prayers,
Unceasingly, remembering—your work of faith and labour of love and endurance of hope, of our Lord Jesus Christ, before our God and Father:
Knowing, brethren beloved by God, your election,—
How that, our glad-message, came not unto you, in word only, but also in power, and in Holy Spirit, and in much assurance,—even as ye know what manner of men we became unto you, for your sake;
And, ye, became, imitators of us, and of the Lord, giving welcome unto the word, in much tribulation, with joy of Holy Spirit;
So that ye became an ensample unto all who were coming to the faith, in Macedonia and in Achaia:
From you, in fact, hath sounded forth the word of the Lord—not only in Macedonia and in Achaia, but, in every place, your faith which is toward God, hath gone forth, so that, no need, have we to be saying anything;
For, they themselves, concerning us, do tell—what manner of entrance we had unto you, and how ye turned unto God from the idols—to be serving a living and true God,
And awaiting his Son out of the heavens—whom he raised from among the dead,—Jesus: Who is to rescue us out of the anger that is coming.

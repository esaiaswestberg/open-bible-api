Putting away, therefore, all vice and all deceit and hypocrisy and envyings and all detractions,
As new-born babes, for the pure milk that is for the mind, eagerly crave, that, thereby, ye may grow unto salvation:—
If ye have tasted for yourselves that, gracious, is the Lord,—
Unto whom coming near, as unto a living stone—by men, indeed, rejected, but, with God, chosen, held in honour,
Yourselves also, as living stones, are being built up a spiritual house, for a holy priesthood, to offer spiritual sacrifices, well-pleasing unto God through Jesus Christ;
Inasmuch as it is contained in scripture—Lo! I lay in Zion an outmost corner stone, chosen, held in honour, and, he that resteth faith thereupon, shall not be put to shame.
Unto you, then, is the honour—[unto you] who believe; but, unto such as disbelieve, The stone which the builders rejected,—The same, hath become head of the corner,
And a stone to strike against, and a rock to stumble over: Who stumble because, unto the word, they do not yield,—unto which also they have been appointed;
But, ye, are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people for a peculiar treasure, that, the excellences, ye may tell forth, of him who, out of darkness, hath called you into his marvellous light:—
Who, at one time, were a No-people, but, now, are a people of God,—who had not been enjoying mercy, but, now, have received mercy.
Beloved! I exhort you, as sojourners and pilgrims, to abstain from fleshly covetings, such as take the field against the soul;
Having, your behaviour among the nations, honourable,—in order that, wherein they speak against you as evil-doers, they may, owing to the honourable works they are permitted to behold, glorify God in the day of visitation.
Submit yourselves unto every human creation, for the Lord’s sake,—whether unto a king, as one that protecteth,
Or unto governors, as, through him, sent—for vengeance on evil-doers, but praise to such as do good;
Because, so, is the will of God,—by doing good, to be putting to silence, the ignorance of heedless men:
As free, yet, not as a cloak of vice, holding your freedom, but, as God’s servants.
Unto all men, give honour, unto the brotherhood, shew love, unto God, give reverence, the king, hold in honour.
Ye domestics, submitting yourselves, in all reverence, unto your masters,—not only unto the good and considerate, but also unto the perverse;
For, this, is thankworthy,—If, for the sake of conscience towards God, one beareth griefs, suffering wrongfully,—
For what sort of honour is it—if, committing sin, and being buffeted, ye endure it? But, if, doing good, and suffering, ye endure it, this, is thankworthy with God.
For, hereunto, have ye been called; because, Christ also, suffered in your behalf, unto you, leaving behind a pattern, that ye might follow in his steps:
Who did not, a sin, commit, neither was deceit found in his mouth,—
Who, being reviled, was not reviling again, suffering, he was not threatening, but was making surrender unto him that judgeth righteously,—
Who, our sins, himself, bare up, in his body, unto the tree, in order that we, from our sins getting away, in righteousness, might live,—by whose stripes, ye have been healed;
For ye were as sheep going astray, but have now turned back unto the shepherd and overseer of your souls.

But we request you, brethren,—in behalf of the Presence of our Lord Jesus Christ, and our gathering together unto him,
That ye be not quickly tossed from your mind, nor be put in alarm—either by spirit, or by discourse, or by letter as by us, as that the day of the Lord, hath set in:
That no one may cheat, you, in any one respect. Because [that day will not set in] —except the revolt come first, and there he revealed the man of lawlessness, the son of destruction,
The one who opposeth and exalteth himself on high against every one called God, or an object of worship; so that he, within the sanctuary of God, shall take his seat, showeth himself forth, that he is, God:—
Remember ye not, that, while I was yet with you, these very things, I was telling you?
And, what now restraineth, ye know, to the end he may be revealed in his own fitting time;
For, the secret, of lawlessness, already, is inwardly working itself,—only, until, he that restraineth at present, shall be gone, out of the midst:
And, then, shall be revealed the lawless one,—whom, the Lord [Jesus], will slay with the Spirit of his mouth, and paralyse with the forthshining of his Presence:—
Whose, presence, [shall be] according to an inworking of Satan, with all manner of mighty work and signs and wonders of falsehood,
And with all manner of deceit of unrighteousness, in them who are destroying themselves, because, the love of the truth, they did not welcome, that they might be saved;—
And, for this cause, God sendeth them an inworking of error, to the end they should believe in the falsehood,—
In order that should be judged who would not believe in the truth, but were well-pleased with the unrighteousness.
But, we, are bound to give thanks unto God continually concerning you, brethren beloved by the Lord, for that God chose you, from the beginning, unto salvation, in sanctification of spirit and belief of truth,—
Unto which he called you, through means of our glad-message, unto an acquiring of the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ.
Hence, then, brethren, stand firm, and hold fast the instructions which ye were taught—whether through discourse, or through our letter.
But may, our Lord Jesus Christ himself, and our God and Father,—Who hath loved you, and given you age-abiding consolation and good hope by favour,
Console your hearts, and confirm you in every good work and word!

[Even] the first, indeed, therefore, used to have righteous appointments of divine service, even the holy ritual well arranged.
For a tent was prepared, the first, in which were both the lampstand and the table and the setting forth of the loaves,—the which is called the Holy place;
But, after the second veil, a tent, that which is called Most Holy:
Having a golden altar of incense, and the ark of the covenant covered around on every side with gold, in which was a golden jar holding the manna, and the rod of Aaron that sprouted, and the tables of the covenant;
But, over-above it, Cherubim of glory overshadowing the propitiatory:—concerning which things, it is not now [needful] to be speaking, particularly.
Now, these things having been thus prepared, into the first tent, indeed, continually do the priests enter, the divine services completing;
But, into the second, once for all in the year, only the high-priest, not without blood, which he offered for himself and the ignorances of the people:
The Holy Spirit making this evident—that, not yet, hath been manifested, the way through the Holy place, so long as the first tent hath a standing.
The which is a similitude for the present season, according to which both gifts and sacrifices are offered, which cannot, as to the conscience, perfect him that rendereth the divine service:—
Only as to eatings, and drinkings, and diversified immersions,—righteous-appointments of the flesh, which, until a season of rectifying, are in force.
But, when Christ approached, as high-priest of the coming good things, through the greater and more perfect tent, not made by hand, that is, not of this creation,—
Nor yet through blood of goats and calves, but through his own blood he entered once for all into the Holy place, age-abiding redemption discovering.
For if the blood of goats and bulls, and the ashes of a heifer sprinkling the profaned, halloweth unto the purity of the flesh,
How much rather shall the blood of the Christ, who through an age-abiding spirit offered himself unspotted unto God, purify our conscience from dead works, to the rendering of divine-service, unto a Living God?
And, for this cause, of a new covenant, is he mediator,—to the end that, death coming to pass for the redemption of the transgressions against the first covenant, the called might receive the promise of the age-abiding inheritance;
For, where a covenant is, it is necessary for, the death, to be brought in, of him that hath covenanted;
For, a covenant over dead persons, is firm,—since it is not then of force when he is living that hath covenanted.
Whence, not even the first, apart from blood, hath been consecrated;
For, when every commandment according to the law had been spoken by Moses unto all the people, taking the blood of the calves and the goats, with water and scarlet wool and hyssop, both, the scroll itself, and all the people, he sprinkled;
Saying—This, is the blood of the covenant which, God, hath sent in command unto you:
Yea, the tent also, and all the utensils of the public ministry, with blood, in like manner, he sprinkled:
And, nearly, all things, with blood, are purified, according to the law, and, apart from blood-shedding, cometh no remission.
It was indeed therefore necessary for the glimpses of the things in the heavens with these to be purified; but, the heavenly things themselves, with better sacrifices than these.
For, not into a Holy place made by hand, entered Christ,—counterpart of the real [Holy place] ; but, into the heaven itself, now, to be plainly manifested before the face of God in our behalf;—
Nor yet that, ofttimes, he should be offering himself,—just as the high-priest entereth into the Holy place, year by year, with alien blood;—
Else had it been needful for him, ofttimes, to suffer, from the foundation of the world; but, now, once for all, upon a conjunction of the ages, for a setting aside of sin through means of his sacrifice, hath he been made manifest;
And, inasmuch as it is in store for men—once for all to die, but after this, judgment,
Thus, the Christ also, once for all having been offered, for the bearing of the sins, of many, a second time, apart from sin, will appear, to them who for him are ardently waiting—unto salvation.

Now, these, are the kings of the land, whom the sons of Israel had smitten, and of whose land they had taken possession, over the Jordan, towards the rising of the sun,—from the ravine of Arnon, as far as Mount Hermon, and all the waste plain, on the east:
Sihon, king of the Amorites, who dwelt in Heshbon,—ruling from Aroer, which is on the edge of the ravine of Arnon, and the middle of the ravine, and half Gilead, even as far as the ravine Jabbok, the boundary of the sons of Ammon;
and the waste plain as far as the sea of Chinneroth, on the east, even as far as the sea of the waste plain, the salt sea, on the east, the way to Bethjeshimoth,—and, on the south, under the slopes of Pisgah;
and the boundary of Og, king of Bashan, of the remnant of the giants,—him who dwelt in Ashtaroth and in Edrei;
ruling also in Mount Hermon, and in Salecah, and in all Bashan, as far as the boundary of the Geshurites, and the Maacathites,—and half Gilead, the boundary of Sihon king of Heshbon:—
Moses the servant of Yahweh, and the sons of Israel, had smitten them,—and Moses the servant of Yahweh, had given it, as a possession, unto the Reubenites, and unto the Gadites, and unto the half tribe of Manasseh.
And, these, are the kings of the land, whom Joshua and the sons of Israel smote over the Jordan, towards the west, from Baal-gad in the valley of the Lebanon, even as far as the Mount Halak that goeth up towards Seir,—and Joshua gave it unto the tribes of Israel, as a possession, according to their portions;
in the hill country and in the lowland, and in the waste plain, and in the slopes, and in the desert, and in the south,—the Hittite, the Amorite, and the Canaanite, the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite:—

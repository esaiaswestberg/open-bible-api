Then came out the lot, for the sons of Joseph, from the Jordan by Jericho, at the waters of Jericho, eastward,—the desert, going up from Jericho, through the hill country to Bethel;
and it goeth out from Bethel towards Luz,—and passeth over unto the boundary of the Archites at Ataroth;
and descendeth westward, unto the boundary of the Japhletites, as far as the boundary of Bethhoron the nether, and as far as Gezer,—and the extensions thereof are to the sea.
So the sons of Joseph, Manasseh and Ephraim, received their inheritance.
And the boundary of the sons of Ephraim, by their families, was,—yea the boundary of their inheritance on the east, was Ataroth-addar, as far as Beth-horon the upper;
and the boundary goeth out westward at Michmethath, on the north, then the boundary bendeth round easward, to Taanath-shiloh,—and passeth by it on the east to Janoah;
and goeth down from Janoah to Ataroth and to Naarah,—and toucheth upon Jericho, and goeth out at the Jordan.
From Tappuah, runneth the boundary along westward, to the ravine of Kanah, and the extensions thereof are to the sea,—this, is the inheritance of the tribe of the sons of Ephraim, by their families;
together with the cities which were separated for the sons of Ephraim, in the midst of the inheritance of the sons of Manasseh,—all the cities, with their villages.
But they did not dispossess the Canaanites who were dwelling in Gazer,—so the Canaanites have dwelt in the midst of Ephraim unto this day, and have become tributary servants.

The story of Nehemiah, son of Hacaliah,—and it came to pass, in the month Chislev, in the twentieth year, when, I, was in Shusan the fortress,
that Hanani one of my brethren came, he and certain men out of Judah,—so I asked them concerning the Jews who had escaped, who were left of the captivity, and concerning Jerusalem.
And they said unto me, The remnant who are left of the captivity, there in the province, are in great misfortune and reproach, the wall of Jerusalem, is broken down, and, the gates thereof, are burned with fire.
And it came to pass, when I heard these words, that I sat down and wept, and I mourned certain days,—and continued fasting and praying, before the God of the heavens;
and said, I beseech thee, O Yahweh God of the heavens, the great and fearful GOD,—keeping the covenant and lovingkindness for them who love him and keep his commandments:
Let, I pray thee, thine ears be attentive and thine eyes open—to hearken unto the prayer of thy servant—which, I, am praying before thee now, day and night, for the sons of Israel, thy servants,—and making confession concerning the sins of the sons of Israel, which we have committed against thee, both I and the house of my father, have sinned.
We have dealt, very corruptly, against thee,—and have not kept the commandments, nor the statutes nor the regulations, which thou didst command Moses thy servant.
Remember, I pray thee, the word, which thou didst command Moses thy servant, saying,—If, ye, are unfaithful, I, will scatter you among the peoples:
When ye return unto me and keep my commandments and do them, though it should be that ye have been driven out unto the uttermost part of the heavens, from thence, will I gather them, and bring them into the place that I have chosen to make a habitation for my Name there.
They, therefore, are thy servants, and thy people,—whom thou hast redeemed by thy great power, and by thy firm hand.
I beseech thee O My Lord, let—I pray thee—thine ear be attentive unto the prayer of thy servant, and unto the prayer of thy servants who delight to revere thy Name, and oh prosper, I pray thee, thy servant to-day, and grant him compassion before this man. Now, I, was cup-bearer unto the king.

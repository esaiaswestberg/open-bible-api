And, the rest of the people—the priests, the Levites, the doorkeepers, the singers, the Nethinim, and all who had separated themselves from the peoples of the lands unto the law of God, their wives, their sons and their daughters,—every one having knowledge and understanding,
were holding fast unto their distinguished brethren, and were entering into a curse and into an oath, to walk in the law of God, which was given through Moses the servant of God,—and to observe and do, all the commandments of Yahweh our Lord, and his regulations, and his statutes;
and that we would not give our daughters unto the peoples of the land,—and, their daughters, would we not take for our sons;
and, if the peoples of the land should be bringing in wares, or any corn on the sabbath day, to sell, we would not buy of them on the sabbath, or on a holy day,—and that we would remit the seventh year, and the loan of every hand.
And we laid on ourselves charges, appointing for ourselves the third of a shekel, yearly,—for the service of the house of our God:
for the bread to set in array, and the continual meal-offering, and for the continual ascending-sacrifice, of the sabbaths, of the new moons, for the appointed feasts, and for things hallowed, and for victims bearing sin, to put a propitiatory-covering over Israel,—and for all the work of the house of our God.
Also, lots, did we cast, concerning the offering of wood among the priests, the Levites, and the people, to bring it unto the house of our God, by our ancestral houses, at times arranged, year by year,—to burn upon the altar of Yahweh our God, as it is written in the law.
And that we would bring in the firstfruits of our ground, and the firstfruit of all fruit of all trees, year by year,—unto the house of Yahweh;
also that, the firstborn of our sons, and of our cattle, as it is written in the law,—and the firstlings of our herds and of our flocks, we would bring in unto the house of our God, unto the priests who should be in attendance in the house of our God;
and, the first part of our meal and our heave-offerings and the fruit of all trees, new wine and oil, would we bring in unto the priests, into the chambers of the house of our God, and the tithe of our ground unto the Levites,—the Levites themselves, taking the tithes in all our cities of agriculture.
And the priest the son of Aaron should be with the Levites, when the Levites should take the tithes,—and the Levites, should bring up the tithe of the tithe, unto the house of our God, into the chambers pertaining unto the treasure-house.
For, into the chambers, should the sons of Israel and the sons of Levi bring in the heave-offering of the corn, the new wine and the oil, since, there, are the utensils of the sanctuary, and the priests who are in attendance, and the doorkeepers, and the singers,—so would we not neglect the house of our God.

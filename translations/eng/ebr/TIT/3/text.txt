Be putting them in mind, unto rulerships, unto authorities, to be in submission, to be yielding to rule, for every good work, to be, prepared,
To be defaming, no one, to be, averse to strife, considerate, shewing, all, meekness unto all men.
For, even we, used, at one time, to be—thoughtless, unyielding, deceived, in servitude unto manifold covetings and pleasures, in malice and envy, leading on, detestable, hating one another.
But, when, the graciousness and affection for man of our Saviour God, shone forth,
Not by works which we had done in righteousness, but, according to his mercy, he saved us—through means of the bathing of a new birth, and the moulding anew of Holy Spirit.—
Which he poured on us richly, through Jesus Christ our Saviour,
In order that, having been declared righteous by his favour, we should be made inheritors, according to hope, of life age-abiding.
Faithful, the saying! And, concerning these things, I am minded that thou be strongly affirming, in order that they who have believed God may be careful to be forward, in noble works. These things, are honourable, and profitable unto men;
But, foolish questionings, and genealogies, and strife, and contentions about matters of law, avoid, for they are unprofitable and vain.
From a party-man, after a first and second admonition, excuse thyself;
Knowing that such a one is perverted, and sinneth, being self-condemned.
As soon as I shall send Artemus unto thee, or Tychicus, give diligence to come to me unto Nicopolis; for, there, have I determined to winter.
Zenas the lawyer, and Apollos, do thou diligently set forward on their way, in order that, nothing, unto them, may be wanting.
Moreover, let our own learn to be forward, in honourable works, for the necessary uses, that they may not be unfruitful.
All they who are with me salute thee. Salute thou them who regard us with faithful affection. Favour, be with you all.

But do, thou, speak the things which become the healthful instruction:—
That, aged men, be, sober, grave, sober-minded, healthy in their faith, love, endurance;
Aged women, in the same way, in deportment, as becometh sacred persons, not given to intrigue, nor yet, to much wine, enslaved, teachers of virtue,—
That they may constrain the young women to be, lovers of their husbands, lovers of their children,
soberminded, chaste, workers at home, good, submitting themselves to their own husbands,—that, the word of God, be not defamed;
The younger men, in the same way, exhort thou to be sober-minded:
In all things, shewing, thyself, an ensample of noble works,—in thine instruction, uncorruptness, gravity,
healthful discourse that cannot be condemned, in order that, he that is of the contrary part, may relent, having nothing to say concerning us that is disparaging:
Servants, unto their own masters, to be submitting themselves in all things, to be, well-pleasing, not gainsaying,
not taking anything away, shewing, all good faith,—that, the instruction which is of our Saviour God, they may adorn in all things.
For the favour of God, bringing salvation for all men, hath shone forth,
Putting us under discipline—in order that,—denying ourselves of ungodliness and worldly covetings, in a soberminded and righteous and godly manner, we should live, in the present age,
Prepared to welcome the happy hope and forthshining of the glory of the great God and our Saviour Christ Jesus,—
Who gave himself up in our behalf, that he might redeem us from all manner of lawlessness, and purify for himself a people as his own treasure—zealous of noble works.
As to these things, be speaking and exhorting and reproving, with all manner of precept: let, no one, disregard thee!

When there shall arise in thy midst—a prophet, or a dreamer of dreams,—and he shall give unto thee a sign or a wonder;
and the sign or the wonder shall come in, whereof he spake unto thee, saying,—Let us go after other gods, which ye know not and let us serve them
thou shalt not hearken unto the words of that prophet, or unto that dreamer of dreams,—for Yahweh your God, is putting you to the proof, to know whether ye do love Yahweh your God, with all your heart and with all your soul.
After Yahweh your God, shall ye walk And him, shall ye revere,—And his commandments, shall ye observe. And unto his voice, shall ye hearken, And him, shall ye serve And unto him, shall ye cleave.
And that prophet or that dreamer of dreams, shall be put to death because he hath spoken revolt against Yahweh your God,—who brought you forth out of the land of Egypt and redeemed thee out of the house of servants, to seduce thee out of the way wherein Yahweh thy God hath commanded thee to walk,—so shalt thou consume the wicked thing out of thy midst.
When thy brother—son of thine own mother or thine own son or thine own daughter, or the wife of thy bosom, or thy friend who is as thine own soul, shall entice thee secretly, saying,—Let us go and serve other gods, whom thou hast not known, thou, nor thy fathers;
of the gods of the peoples who are round about you, who are near unto thee, or who are far off from thee,—from one end of the earth even unto the other end of the earth,
thou shalt not consent unto him, neither shalt thou hearken unto him,—neither shall thine eye look with pity upon him, neither shalt thou spare—neither shalt thou conceal him;
but thou shalt slay, him, thine own hand, shall be on him first, to put him to death,—and the hand of all the people afterwards.
And thou shalt stone him with stones that he die,—for he hath sought to seduce thee from Yahweh thy God, who brought thee forth out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of servants.
And, all Israel, shall hear and fear,—and shall not again do according to this wickedness in thy midst.
When thou shalt hear—in one of thy cities which Yahweh thy God is giving unto thee to dwell there—saying:
There have gone forth men sons of the Abandoned One, out of thy midst, and have seduced the inhabitants of their city, saying,—Let us go, and serve other gods which ye have not known;
and thou shalt enquire, and search out, and ask diligently,—and lo! true—certain, is the thing, this abomination, hath been done, in thy midst,
then shalt thou smite, the inhabitants of that city with the edge of the sword, devoting it to destruction, and all that is therein and the cattle thereof: with the edge of the sword,—
and all the spoil thereof, shalt thou gather together into the midst of the broadway thereof, and shalt consume with fire the city and all the spoil thereof, every whit, unto Yahweh thy God,—and it shall be a heap unto times age-abiding, it shall be built no more.
So shall there not cleave to thy hand aught of the devoted thing,—that Yahweh may turn away, from the glow of his anger and grant thee compassion and have compassion upon thee and multiply thee, as he sware unto thy fathers;
so long as thou shalt hearken unto the voice of Yahweh thy God, to keep all his commandments, which I am commanding thee to-day,—to do what is right in the eyes of Yahweh thy God.

So then Moses went up, from the waste plains of Moab into Mount Nebo, the head of Pisgah, which is over against Jericho,—and Yahweh showed him all the land—even Gilead as far as Dan;
and all Naphtali, and the land of Ephraim and Manasseh,—and all the land of Judah, as far as the hinder sea;
and the South,—and the circuit of the valley of Jericho, the city of palm trees as far as Zoar.
And Yahweh said unto him—This, is the land which I sware to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, saying, Unto thy seed, will I give it. I have let thee see with thine own eyes, But thither, shalt thou not pass over.
So Moses, the servant of Yahweh, died there, in the land of Moab, at the bidding of Yahweh;
and he buried him, in a valley in the land of Moab, over against Beth-peor,—but no man hath known his burying-place, until this day.
Now, Moses, was a hundred and twenty years old, when he died,—his eye had not dimmed, nor had his freshness fled.
And the sons of Israel bewailed Moses in the waste plains of Moab thirty days,—then were completed the wailing-days of the mourning for Moses.
But, Joshua, son of Nun, was full of the spirit of wisdom, for Moses had laid his hands upon him,—so the sons of Israel hearkened unto him, and did, as Yahweh commanded Moses.
And there arose not a prophet any more in Israel, like unto Moses,—whom Yahweh acknowledged, face to face;
by all the signs and the wonders which Yahweh sent him to do in the land of Egypt,—unto Pharaoh and unto all his servants and unto all his land;
and by all the firm hand, and by all the great terror which Moses wrought in the sight of all Israel.

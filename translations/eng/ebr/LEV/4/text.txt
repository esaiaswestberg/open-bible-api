And Yahweh spake, unto Moses, saying:
Speak thou unto the sons of Israel, saying—When any person, shall sin by mistake, departing from any of the commandments of Yahweh, as to things which should not be done, and shall do any one of them,—
If, the anointed priest, shall sin, so as to bring guilt upon the people, then shall he bring near for his sin which he hath committed a choice young bullock without defect, unto Yahweh as a sin-bearer.
And he shall bring in the bullock unto the entrance of the tent of meeting, before Yahweh,—and shall lean his hand upon the head of the bullock, and shall slay the bullock before Yahweh.
And the anointed priest shall take of the blood of the bullock,—and bring it into the tent of meeting;
and the priest shall dip his finger in the blood,—and sprinkle of the blood seven times, before Yahweh, in front of the veil of the sanctuary.
Then shall the priest put of the blood upon the horns of the altar of fragrant incense before Yahweh, which is in the tent of meeting,—and, all the [remainder of the] blood of the bullock, shall he pour out at the base of the altar of ascending-sacrifice, which is at the entrance of the tent of meeting,
And all the fat of the sin-bearing bullock, shall he heave up therefrom,—the fat that covereth over the inwards, and all the fat that is upon the inwards;
and the two kidneys, and the fat that is upon them which is upon the loins,—and as for the caul upon the liver, upon the kidneys, shall he remove it:
just as it is heaved up from the ox of the peace-offering,—and the priest shall make of them a perfume on the altar of ascending-sacrifice,
But, as for the skin of the bullock and all its flesh with its head and with its legs,—and its inwards, and its dung,
he shall take forth the entire bullock—unto the outside of the camp, unto a clean place unto the outpoured heap of fat-ashes, and shall burn it up on wood in the fire,—upon the outpoured heap of fat-ashes, shall it be burned up.
And, if the whole assembly of Israel, shall make a mistake, and a matter be hidden from the eyes of the convocation,—and so they do something, whereby they depart from any of the commandments of Yahweh as to things which should not be done, and become guilty;
and the sin shall become known, which they have committed therein, then shall the convocation bring near a choice young bullock as a sin-bearer, yea they shall bring it in. before the tent of meeting;
and the elders of the assembly shall lean their hands upon the head of the bullock before Yahweh,—and shall slay the bullock, before Yahweh;
and the anointed priest shall bring in of the blood of the bullock,—into the tent of meeting;
and the priest shall dip his finger in the blood,—and shall sprinkle of the blood seven times before Yahweh, upon the face of the veil;
and, some of the blood, shall he put upon the horns of the altar which is before Yahweh, which is in the tent of meeting; and, all the [remainder of the] blood, shall he pour out at the base of the altar of ascending-sacrifice, which is at the entrance of the tent of meeting;
and, as for all the fat thereof, he shall heave up therefrom,—and make a perfume at the altar.
And he shall do to the bullock, as he did to the [first] sin-bearing bullock, so shall he do with this,—and the priest shall put a propitiatory-covering over them, and it shall be forgiven them.
And he shall take forth the bullock unto the outside of the camp, and burn it up, just as he burned up the first bullock,—the sin-bearer of the convocation, it is.
When a prince, shall sin,—and shall do something, departing from any of the commandments of Yahweh his God as to things which should not be done, by mistake and shall become aware of his guilt;
or his sin wherein he hath sinned be made known unto him, then shall he bring in. as his oblation a he-goat a male without defect;
and shall lean his hand upon the head of the goat, and shall slay it in the place where they slay the ascending-sacrifice before Yahweh,—a sin-bearer, it is.
And the priest shall take of the blood of the sin-bearer with his finger, and put upon the horns of the altar of ascending-sacrifice; and, the [remainder of the] blood thereof, shall he pour out at the base of the altar of ascending-sacrifice;
and with all the fat thereof, shall he make a perfume at the altar, as with the fat of the peace-offering,—so shall the priest put a propitiatory-covering over him because of his sin, and it shall be forgiven him.
And, if, any person, shall sin, by mistake from among the people of the land,—by his doing anything departing from any of the commandments of Yahweh, as to things which should not be done, and shall become aware of his guilt;
or his sin which he hath committed shall be made known unto, him, then shall he bring in, as his oblation, a kid of the goats a female, without defect, for his sin which he hath committed;
and shall lean his hand upon the head of the sin-bearer,—and shall slay the sin-bearer in the place of the ascending-sacrifice.
Then shall the priest take of the blood thereof with his finger, and put upon the horns of the altar of ascending-sacrifice,—and all the [remaining] blood thereof, shall he pour out, at the base of the altar;
and all the fat thereof, shall he remove as the fat from off the peace-offering was removed, and the priest shall make a perfume at the altar, for a satisfying odour unto Yahweh,—so shall the priest put a propitiatory-covering over him, and it shall be forgiven him.
And, if a lamb, he bring in. as his oblation for a sin-bearer, a female without defect, shall he bring in;
and shall lean his hand upon the head of the sin-bearer,—and shall slay it as a sin-bearer, in the place where they slay the ascending-sacrifice.
Then shall the priest take of the blood of the sin-bearer with his finger, and put upon the horns of the altar of ascending-sacrifice,—and all the [remaining] blood thereof, shall he pour out, at the base of the altar;
and all the fat thereof, shall he remove as the fat of the lamb is removed, from the peace-offering, and the priest shall make a perfume therewith at the altar, upon the altar-flames of Yahweh,—so shall the priest put a propitiatory-covering over him on account of his sin which he hath committed, and it shall be forgiven him.

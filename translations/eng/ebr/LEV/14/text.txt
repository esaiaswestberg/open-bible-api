And Yahweh spake unto Moses, saying—
This, shall be the law of the leper, in the day when he is declared clean,—he shall be brought in unto the priest;
then shall the priest go forth unto the outside of the camp,—and the priest shall take a view, and lo! if the plague of leprosy hath been healed out of the leper,;
then shall the priest give command,—and there shall be taken—for him that is to be cleansed—two living clean birds,—and cedar wood, and crimson am hyssop;
and the priest shall give command, and one bird shall be slain,—within an earthen vessel over living water:
as for the living bird, he shall take, it, and the cedar wood and the crimson, and the hyssop,—and shall dip them and the living bird, in the blood of the bird that hath been slain over the living water;
and shall sprinkle upon him that is to be cleansed from the leprosy, seven times,—and shall pronounce him clean, and shall let go the living bird over the face of the field.
And he that is to be declared clean shall wash his clothes and shave off all his hair, and bathe in water, and be clean, and, afterwards, shall he come into the camp,—and dwell outside his tent, seven days;
and it shall be on the seventh day, that he shall shave off all the hair of his head, and his beard, and his eyebrows, even all his hair, shall he shave off,—and shall wash his clothes and bathe his flesh in water so shall he be clean.
And, on the eighth day, he shall take two he-lambs, without defect, and one ewe-lamb, the choice of its year without defect,—and three-tenths of fine meal for a meal-offering, overflowed with oil, and one log of oil.
And the priest that is cleansing him shall cause the man that is to be cleansed, and those things to stand before Yahweh, at the opening of the tent of meeting.
And the priest shall take one he-lamb, and bring him near as a guilt-bearer and the log of oil,—and shall wave them as a wave-offering, before Yahweh;
and shall slay the lamb in the place where the sin-bearer and the ascending-sacrifice are slain, in the holy place,—for like the sin-bearer, the guilt-bearer, is the priest’s, most holy, it is.
Then shall the priest take of the blood of the guilt-bearer, and the priest shall put it upon the tip of the right ear of him that is to be cleansed,—and upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the great toe of his right foot;
and the priest shall take of the log of oil,—and shall pour it upon the palm of the priest’s left hand,
and the priest shall dip his right finger [and take] of the oil that is on the palm of his left hand,—and shall sprinkle of the oil with his finger seven times before Yahweh:
and of the remainder of the oil which is on the palm of his hand, shall the priest put upon the tip of the right ear of him that is to be cleansed, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the great toe of his right foot,—upon the blood of the guilt-bearer;
and that which remaineth of the oil that is on the palm of the priest’s hand, he shall put upon the head of him that is to be cleansed,—so shall the priest put a propitiatory-covering over him, before Yahweh.
Then shall the priest offer the sin-bearer, and shall put a propitiatory-covering over him that is to be cleansed because of his uncleanness,—and, afterwards, shall he slay the ascending-sacrifice.
And the priest shall cause the ascending-sacrifice, and the meal-offering to ascend at the altar,—so shall the priest put a propitiatory-covering over him, and he shall be clean.
But if he be poor and his hand hath not enough, then shall he take one he-lamb as a guilt-bearer to be waved to put a propitiatory-covering over him,—and one-tenth of fine meal, overflowed with oil for a meal-offering, and a log of oil,
and two turtle-doves or two young pigeons, for which his hand hath enough,—so shall one be a sin-bearer, and the other an ascending-sacrifice.
And he shall bring them in on the eighth day, for his cleansing, unto the priest,—unto the entrance of the tent of meeting, before Yahweh.
Then shall the priest take the guilt-bearing lamb and the log of oil,—and the priest shall wave them as a wave-offering, before Yahweh.
Then shall the guilt-bearing lamb be slain, and the priest shall take of the blood of the guilt-bearer, and put upon the tip of the right ear of him that is to be cleansed,—and upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the great toe of his right foot;
also of the oil, shall the priest pour out,—on the palm of his own left hand;
and the priest shall sprinkle with his right finger, of the oil that is on the palm of his left hand,—seven times, before Yahweh;
then shall the priest put, of the oil that is on the palm of his hand, upon the tip of the right ear of him that is to be cleansed, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the great toe of his right foot,—upon the place of the blood of the guilt-offering;
and that which remaineth of the oil which is on the palm of the priest’s hand, shall he put upon the head of him that is to be cleansed,—to put a propitiatory-covering over him before Yahweh.
Then shall he offer one of the turtle-doves, or of the young pigeons,—of that for which his hand hath enough;
even that for which his hand hath enough,—the one as a sin-bearer and the other as an ascending-sacrifice, upon the meal-offering,—so shall the priest put a propitiatory-covering over him that is to be cleansed before Yahweh.
This is the law for him in whom hath been the plague of leprosy, whose hand hath not enough for that which pertaineth to his cleansing.
And Yahweh spake unto Moses and unto Aaron saying:
When ye enter into the land of Canaan which I am about to give you for a possession,—and I put a plague-mark of leprosy in a house, of the land of your possession,
then shall he that owneth the house come in, and tell the priest, saying,—A kind of plague-mark, appeareth to me in the house;
and the priest shall give command, and they shall empty the house, ere yet the priest cometh in to view the mark, so that he do not pronounce unclean all that is in the house,—and, after this, shall the priest come in to view the house:
then shall he view the mark and lo! if the mark is in the walls of the house, with sunken places greenish yellow or reddish,—and they appear to be lower than the [surface of the] wall,
then shall the priest come forth out of the house, unto the entrance of the house,—and shall shut up the house seven days;
and the priest shall return on the seventh day,—and take a view, and lo! if the mark hath spread in the walls of the house,
then shall the priest give command, and they shall pull out the stones, wherein is the mark,—and cast them forth outside the city, into an unclean place;
and, the house itself, shall he cause to be scraped on the inside round about,—and they shall pour out the mortar which they have scraped off, outside the city, into an unclean place;
and shall take other stones, and put in the place of the stones,—and, other mortar, shall he take and plaster the house.
But if the mark again breaketh out in the house, after the taking out of the stones,—and after the scraping of the house and after the plastering,;
then shall the priest come in, and take a view, and lo! if the mark hath spread in the house, a fretting leprosy, it is in the house unclean, it is,
and he shall pull down the house,—the stones thereof, and the timber thereof and all the mortar of the house,—and shall carry them forth outside the city, into an unclean place.
And as for him that entereth into the house, all the days it is shut up, he shall be unclean until the evening;
And, he that lieth in the house, shall wash his clothes, and he that eateth in the house shall wash his clothes.
But, though the priest do come, into the house, and take a view, yet lo! if the plague-mark hath not spread in the house after the house was plastered, then shall the priest pronounce the house clean, for, healed, is the plague.
Then shall he take to cleanse, the house, two birds,—and cedar wood, and crimson, and hyssop;
and shall kill one bird,—within an earthen vessel over living water;
and take the cedar wood and the hyssop, and the crimson and the living bird, and dip them in the blood of the slain bird, and in the living water,—and sprinkle the house seven times;
and so cleanse the house, with the blood of the bird and with the living water,—and with the living bird, and with the cedar wood and with the hyssop, and with the crimson;
and shall let go the living bird unto the outside of the city, unto the face of the field,—so shall he put a propitiatory-covering over the house and it shall be clean.
This, is the law,—for every plague-mark of leprosy and for scall;
and for garment leprosy, and for house [leprosy] ;
and for rising, and for scab and for a bright spot;
to give instruction, on the day of declaring unclean, and on the day of declaring clean,—This is the law of leprosy.

And the sons of Reuben the firstborn of Israel, for, he, was the firstborn, but because he defiled the couch of his father, his birthright was given to the sons of Joseph son of Israel,—and he is not to be enrolled in the place of firstborn,
for, Judah, prevailed over his brethren, so that, even the prince, is from him,—although, the birthright, pertaineth to Joseph;
the sons of Reuben the firstborn of Israel, Hanoch and Pallu, Hezron and Carmi.
The sons of Joel, Shemaiah his son, Gog his son, Shimei his son;
Micah his son, Reaiah his son, Baal his son;
Beerah his son, whom Tilgath-pilneser king of Assyria carried away captive,—he, was a leader to the Reubenites;
and his brethren, by his families, in the genealogical registering, by their generations,—the chief Jeiel, and Zechariah;
and Bela, the son of Azaz, the son of Shema, the son of Joel,—he, dwelt in Aroer, even as far as Nebo, and Baal-meon;
and, eastward, dwelt he as far as the entering in of the desert, from the river Euphrates,—because, their cattle, were multiplied in the land of Gilead;
and, in the days of Saul, they made war with the Hagrites, who fell by their hand,—so they dwelt in their tents, over all the face of the land east of Gilead.
And, the sons of Gad, over against them, dwelt, in the land of Bashan, as far as Salecah:
Joel the chief, and Shapham, the second,—and Janai and Shaphat, in Bashan;
and their brethren of their ancestral house, Michael and Meshullam and Sheba and Jorai and Jacan and Zia and Eber, seven.
These, were the sons of Abihail, son of Huri, son of Jaroah, son of Gilead, son of Michael, son of Jehishai, son of Jahdo, son of Buz,
Ahi son of Abdiel, son of Guni, chief of their ancestral house;
and they dwelt in Gilead—in Bashan, and in her villages,—and in all the pasture-lands of Sharon, up to their outgoings.
All of them, were genealogically registered in the days of Jotham king of Judah,—and in the days of Jeroboam king of Israel.
the sons of Reuben and Gad, and half tribe of Manasseh, of the sons of valour, men bearing shield and sword and bending the bow, and instructed in war, were forty-four thousand and seven hundred and sixty, ready to go forth in the host.
So they made war with the Hagrites,—and Jetur and Naphish, and Nodab;
and were helped against them, and the Hagrites and all that were with them were delivered into their hand,—for, unto God, made they outcry, in the war, and he suffered himself to be entreated by them, because they put their trust in him;
and they captured their cattle—their camels, fifty thousand, and, flocks, two hundred and fifty thousand, and, asses, two thousand,—and, persons of men, a hundred thousand;
for, many slain, fell, for, of God, was the war,—and they dwelt in their stead, until the captivity.
And, the sons of the half tribe of Manasseh, dwelt in the land,—from Bashan, as far as to Baal-hermon and Senir and Mount Hermon, they, were multiplied.
And, these, were the heads of their ancestral house,—Epher and Ishi and Eliel and Azriel and Jeremiah and Hodaviah and Jahdiel, men who were heroes of valour, men of renown, chiefs to their ancestral house.
But they dealt unfaithfully with the God of their fathers,—and went unchastely after the gods of the peoples of the land, whom God destroyed from before them;
so the God of Israel stirred up the spirit of Pul king of Assyria, and the spirit of Tilgath-pilneser king of Assyria, and he took them away captive, even the Reubenites and the Gadites and the half tribe of Manasseh,—and brought them in unto Halah, and Habor, and Hara, and to the river of Gozan, unto this day.

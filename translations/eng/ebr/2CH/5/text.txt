Thus was perfected, all the work, which Solomon made, for the house of Yahweh,—and Solomon brought in the hallowed things of David his father, the silver, and the gold, and all the utensils, placed he, in the treasuries of the house of God.
Then, Solomon called together the elders of Israel, and all the chiefs of the tribes, the ancestral leaders of the sons of Israel, unto Jerusalem,—to bring up the ark of the covenant of Yahweh out of the city of David, the same, is Zion.
And all the men of Israel came together unto the king, in the festival,—the same, was the seventh month.
And all the elders of Israel came in,—and the Levites bare the ark;
and they brought up the ark, and the tent of meeting, and all the holy utensils, that were in the tent,—the priests the Levites did bring them up.
And, King Solomon, and all the assembly of Israel who assembled themselves unto him, before the ark, were sacrificing sheep and oxen, which could not be told nor could they be counted, for multitude.
And the priests brought in the ark of the covenant of Yahweh into the place thereof, into the shrine of the house, into the holy of holies,—into [the place] beneath the wings of the cherubim;—
for the cherubim were spreading forth two wings, over the place of the ark,—so that the cherubim formed a covering over the ark and over the staves thereof, from above.
And they drew out the staves, and the heads of the staves could be seen out of the ark, in front of the shrine, although they could not be seen on the outside,—and it came to pass that they have remained there—unto this day.
There was, nothing in the ark, save only the two tables, which Moses placed [therein] in Horeb,—when Yahweh made a covenant with the sons of Israel, when they came forth out of Egypt.
And it came to pass, when the priests, came forth, out of the holy place,—for, all the priests who were present, had hallowed themselves, they had no need to observe the courses;
and, the Levites who were the singers, even all of them pertaining to Asaph, to Heman, to Jeduthun, and to their sons and to their brethren, arrayed in white linen, with cymbals and with harps and lyres, stood eastward of the altar,—and, with them, priests to the number of a hundred-and-twenty, blowing with trumpets,
then came it to pass, when the trumpeters and the singers were, as one, to make one sound to be heard in offering praise and giving thanks unto Yahweh—yea when they did lift on high the voice, with the trumpets and with the cymbals and with the instruments of song, yea in offering praise unto Yahweh—For he is good, For, age-abiding, is his lovingkindness, that, the house, was filled with the cloud of the glory of Yahweh;
and the priests could not stand to minister, by reason of the cloud,-for, the glory of Yahweh, filled, the house of God.

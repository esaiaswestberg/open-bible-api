Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus, through God’s will, unto the saints who are [in Ephesus] and faithful in Christ Jesus,—
Favour unto you, and peace, from God our Father, and Lord Jesus Christ.
Blessed, be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who hath blessed us with every spiritual blessing, in the heavenlies, in Christ,
According as he made choice of us, in him, before the founding of a world, that we might be holy and blameless in his presence; in love,
marking us out beforehand unto sonship, through Jesus Christ, for himself, according to the good pleasure of his will,
Unto the praise of the glory of his favour wherewith he favoured us in the Beloved One,—
In whom we have the redemption through his blood, the remission of our offences, according to the riches of his favour,
which he made to superabound towards us; in all wisdom and prudence,
making known to us the sacred secret of his will, according to his good pleasure which he purposed in him,—
For an administration of the fulness of the seasons, to reunite for himself (under one head) the all things in the Christ, the things upon the heavens, and the things upon the earth, in him:
In whom also we were taken as an inheritance, according to the purpose of him who energiseth all things according to the counsel of his will,
That we should be for the praise of his glory—we who had hoped beforehand in the Christ,—
In whom, ye also—hearing the word of the truth, the glad-message of your salvation,—in whom also believing,—were sealed with the Spirit of the promise, the Holy [Spirit],
Which is an earnest of our inheritance, unto the redemption of the acquisition;—unto his glorious praise.
For this cause, I also,—having heard of the faith on your part in the Lord Jesus, and that towards all the saints,
Cease not giving thanks in your behalf, making mention in my prayers,
That, the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, would give you a Spirit of wisdom and understanding in gaining a personal knowledge of him,—
The eyes of your heart having been enlightened, that ye may know—what is the hope of his calling, what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints,
And what the surpassing greatness of his power unto us who believe,—according to the energy of the grasp of his might
which he energised in the Christ, when he raised him from among the dead, and seated him at his right hand in the heavenlies,
Over-above all principality, authority, and power, and lordship, and every name that is named, not only in this age, but also in the coming one,
And did put, all things, in subjection beneath his feet. And gave him to be head over all things unto the assembly,
Which, indeed, is his body, the fulness of him who, the all things in all, is for himself filling up.

[Unto] you also—being dead by your offences and sins,
In which at one time ye walked, according to the age of the world, according to the prince of the authority of the air, of the spirit that now energiseth in the sons of disobedience,
Among whom also, we all, had our behaviour, at one time, in the covetings of our flesh, doing the things desired by the flesh and the mind, and were children, by nature, of anger—even as the rest,—
But, God, being rich in mercy, by reason of the great love wherewith he loved us,
Although we were dead by our offences, gave us life together with the Christ,—by favour, ye have been saved,—
And raised us up together, and seated us together in the heavenlies, in Christ:
That he might point out, in the oncoming ages, the surpassing riches of his favour in graciousness upon us, in Christ Jesus;
For, by his favour, have ye been saved, through means of faith, and this [hath come to pass] —not from you, of God, the free-gift!
Not from works, lest anyone should boast.
His, in fact we are—his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus upon a footing of good works, which God prepared beforehand, that, therein, we might walk.
Wherefore, keep in remembrance—that, at one time, ye, the nations in flesh, who are called Uncircumcision by the so-called Circumcision in flesh, made by hand,
That ye were, in that season, separate from Christ, alienated from the citizenship of Israel, and strangers from the covenants of promise, having no hope, and godless in the world;
But, just now, in Christ Jesus, ye, who at one time were afar off, were made nigh in the blood of the Christ;
He, in fact, is our peace—who made both one, and, the enclosing middle-wall, took down,
The enmity, in his flesh—the law of commandments in decrees—bringing to nought,—that, the two, he might create in himself, into one man of new mould, making peace.
And might fully reconcile them both, in one body, through means of the cross,—slaying the enmity thereby;—
And, coming, he announced the glad-message—of peace, unto you, the far off, and peace, unto them that were nigh;
Because, through him, we have our introduction—we both—in one Spirit, unto the Father.
Hence, then—no longer, are ye strangers and sojourners, but ye are fellow-citizens of the saints, and members of the household of God,—
Having been built up on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, there being, for chief corner stone, Jesus Christ himself,—
In whom, an entire building, in process of being fitly joined together, is growing into a holy shrine in [the] Lord;
In whom, ye also, are being builded together, into a habitation of God in Spirit.

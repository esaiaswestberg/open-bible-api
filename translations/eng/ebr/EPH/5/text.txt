Become ye, therefore, imitators of God, as children beloved,
And walk in love—even as, the Christ also, loved you, and delivered himself up in your behalf, an offering and sacrifice unto God, for a fragrance of sweet smell.
But, fornication, and all impurity, or covetousness, let it not be named among you—even as becometh saints;
And shamelessness and foolish talking, or jesting,—which things are beneath you,—but, rather, giving of thanks;
For, this, ye know, if ye take note—that no fornicator, or impure or greedy person, who is an idolater, hath any inheritance in the kingdom of the Christ and God.
Let no one be deceiving you with empty words; for, because of these things, is coming the anger of God upon the sons of obstinacy:
Do not, then, become co-partners with them;
For ye were, at one time, darkness, but, now, are ye light in the Lord,—as children of light, be walking,
For, the fruit of the light, is in all goodness, and righteousness, and truth,—
Putting to the test what is well-pleasing unto the Lord;
And be not joining in fellowship in the unfruitful works of darkness, but, rather, be even administering reproof;
For, of the secret things which are brought to pass by them, it is, shameful, even to speak!
All things, however, when reproved by the light, become manifest, for, all that of itself maketh manifest, is, light;
Wherefore it saith—Up! thou sleeper, and arise from among the dead, and the Christ will shine upon thee.
Be taking heed, therefore, exactly how ye are walking,—not as unwise, but as wise,—
Buying out for yourselves the opportunity, because, the days, are evil;
For this cause, do not become foolish, but have discernment as to what is the will of the Lord;
And be not getting drunk with wine, in which is dissoluteness, but be getting filled in Spirit;—
Speaking to yourselves, with psalms and hymns and spiritual songs; singing, and striking the strings, with your heart unto the Lord;
Giving thanks, always, for all things, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, unto your God and Father;
Submitting yourselves one to another in reverence of Christ,—
Ye wives, unto your own husbands, as unto the Lord,
Because, a husband, is the head of his wife, as, the Christ also, is the head of the assembly, he, being the saviour of the body,—
Nevertheless, as, the assembly, submitteth herself unto the Christ, so, the wives, unto their husbands, in everything:
Ye husbands, be loving your wives, even as, the Christ also, loved the assembly, and delivered, himself, up in her behalf,
That, her, he might sanctify, having purified [her] with the bath of water, in declaration,
That, he, might present, unto himself, the assembly, all glorious, not having spot or wrinkle or any of such things, but that she should be holy and blameless;
So, ought the husbands [also] to be loving their own wives, as their own bodies,—he that loveth his own wife, loveth himself,
No one, in fact, ever yet hated, his own flesh, but nourisheth and cherisheth it,—even as, the Christ, the assembly,
Because, members, are we of his body;—
For this cause, will a man leave his father and his mother, and will cleave unto his wife, and, they two, shall become, one flesh.
This sacred secret, is, great,—I, however, am speaking as to Christ and [as to] the assembly;—
Nevertheless, ye also, do ye, individually, each man be so loving, his own wife, as himself, and, the wife, [see] that she reverence her husband.

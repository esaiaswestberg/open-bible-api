And it was vexing unto Jonah, with a great vexation,—and it angered him.
So he prayed unto Yahweh, and said—Ah now! Yahweh! Was not, this, my word, while I was yet upon mine own soil? For this cause, did I hasten to flee unto Tarshish,—because I knew that, thou, art a GOD of favour and compassion, slow to anger, and abundant in lovingkindness, and art grieved over calamity.
Now, therefore, O Yahweh, take, I pray thee, my life from me,—for it were better for me, to die, than, to live.
Then said Yahweh, Art thou rightly angry?
But Jonah, went forth, out of the city, and abode on the east side of the city; and made for himself there, a hut, and sat under it, in the shade, until he should see what would become of the city.
Now Yahweh God appointed a gourd, and caused it to come up over Jonah, that it might be a shade over his head, to deliver him from his vexation,—and Jonah rejoiced over the gourd, with great rejoicing.
But God appointed a worm, at the uprisings of the dawn, the next day,—and it smote the gourd, that it withered.
And it came to pass, at the breaking forth of the sun, that God appointed a sultry east wind, and the sun smote upon the head of Jonah, that he became faint,—and asked his life, that he might die, and said, It were better for me, to die, than, to live.
Then said God unto Jonah, Art thou rightly angry over the gourd? And he said, I am rightly angry, unto death.
Then said Yahweh, Thou, wouldest have spared the gourd, for which thou hadst not toiled, neither hadst thou made it grow,—which, as the off-spring of a night, came up, and, as the offspring of a night, perished;
And was not, I, to spare Nineveh, the great city,—wherein are more than twelve times ten thousand human beings, who cannot discern between their right hand and their left, besides much cattle?

Bel, hath crouched, Nebo, is cowering, Their images, are delivered up to beast and to cattle,—The things ye carried about, are become a load, A burden, to the weary!
They have cowered they have crouched at once, And they cannot rescue the burden,—But their own soul, into captivity, hath departed.
Hearken unto me O house of Jacob, Even all the remnant of the house of Israel,—Who have been borne from birth, Who have been carried from nativity:
Even unto old age, I, am, the same, And unto grey hairs, I, will bear the burden,—I have made and, I, will carry, Yea, I, will bear the burden and will deliver,
To whom can ye liken me or make me equal? Or compare me, and we be like?
They who pour gold out of a purse, And who weigh silver in a balance,—Who hire a goldsmith that he may make it into a GOD, They adore, yea they bow down;
They carry him about on the shoulder They bear the burden of him—and set him in his place that he may stand,—Out of his place, will he not move,—Though one even make outcry unto him, he will not answer, Out of one’s trouble, he will not save him.
Remember ye this and shew yourselves men,—Bring it back, ye transgressors, to your minds;
Remember ye the things named in advance from age-past times,—For, I, am, The Mighty One, and there is none else, The Adorable and there is none like me!
Declaring from the beginning, the latter end, And from olden time, that which had never been done,—Saying My purpose shall stand, and All my pleasure, will I perform;
Calling, From the East, a Bird of Prey, From a far country, the Man I intended,—Yea I have spoken I will also bring it to pass, I have planned, I will also do it.
Hearken unto me, Ye valiant of heart,—Who are far away from righteousness:
I have brought near my righteousness. It shall not be far away, And my deliverance, shall not linger,—But I will give In Zion, deliverance, To Israel, my glory.

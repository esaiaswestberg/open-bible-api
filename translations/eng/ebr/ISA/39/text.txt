At that time, Merodach-baladan son of Baladan, king of Babylon, sent letters and a present unto Hezekiah,—for he had heard that Hezekiah had been sick, and had recovered.
And Hezekiah, rejoiced over them, and showed them his house of precious things—the silver and the gold and the spices and the precious ointment and all his armoury—and all that was found among his treasures,—there was nothing, which Hezekiah, did not show them—in his house or in all his dominion.
Then came Isaiah the prophet, unto King Hezekiah,—and said unto him—What said these men? and whence came they unto thee? And Hezekiah said, From a land far away, came they unto me, from Babylon!
And he said, What have they seen in thy house? Then said Hezekiah,—All that is in my house, have they seen, there is nothing which I shewed them not among my treasures.
Then said Isaiah unto Hezekiah,—Hear thou the word of Yahweh of hosts:
Lo! days are coming, when all that is in thy house, and that which thy fathers have treasured up until this day, shall be carried away unto Babylon,—nothing, shall be left, Saith Yahweh.
And of thy sons who shall issue from thee whom thou shalt beget, shall they take away,—and they shall become eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon.
And Hezekiah said unto Isaiah, Good is the word of Yahweh, which thou hast spoken. And he said, Surely, there shall be peace and stability in my days.

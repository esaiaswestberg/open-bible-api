For Zion’s sake, will I not hold my peace, And for Jerusalem’s sake, will I not rest,—Until her righteousness, go forth as brightness, And her salvation, as a torch that is lighted.
So shall nations see thy righteousness, And all kings, thy glory; And thou shalt be called by a new name, which, the mouth of Yahweh, will name.
Then shalt thou become—A crown of adorning, in the hand of Yahweh, and A royal diadem in the hand of thy God.
Thou shalt he termed no longer—Forsaken Nor shall thy land be termed any longer A desolation, But, thou, shalt be called Hephzibah [="My delight is in her"], And, thy land, Beulah [="married"],—For Yahweh hath found delight in thee, And thy land, shall be married.
For a young man marrieth, a virgin, Thy sons marry thee! And the bridegroom rejoiceth over the bride—Thy God, rejoiceth over thee.
Upon thy walls O Jerusalem, have I appointed watchmen, All the day and all the night through, let them not hold their peace,—O ye that put Yahweh in mind, Do not take rest to yourselves,
Neither give rest, unto him, Until he establish and until he set forth Jerusalem as a praise in the earth!
Sworn hath Yahweh—By his own right hand, and By his own strong arm,—Surely I will give thy corn no more, as food to thine enemies, Nor shall the sons of the foreigner drink thy new wine, for which thou hast toiled;
But they who have garnered it, shall eat it, and praise Yahweh,—And they who have gathered in its clusters, shall drink it in my holy courts.
Pass ye through pass ye through the gates, Prepare ye the way of the people,—Cast ye up, cast ye up the highway, Clear it of stones, Lift ye high a standard unto the peoples.
Lo! Yahweh, hath sent a message unto the end of the earth: Say ye to the daughter of Zion, Lo! thy Salvation, is coming,—Lo! his reward, is with him, And, his recompense, before him:
So shall men call them—The holy people The redeemed of Yahweh,—And, thou, shalt be called—Sought out, A city not forsaken,

And seven women will take hold of one man in that day, saying, Our own bread, will we eat, And our own apparel, will we wear,—Only let us be called by thy name, to take away our reproach.
In that day, Shall the Bud of Yahweh, become beautiful and glorious,—And the Fruit of the Land splendid and majestic, To the escaped of Israel.
And it shall come to pass—He that is left in Zion! And he that remaineth in Jerusalem, Shall be called, holy,—Everyone written unto life in Jerusalem.
When My Lord shall have bathed away the filth of the daughters of Zion, And the blood-guiltiness of Jerusalem, he shall wash away out of her midst,—By the spirit of judgment, and By the spirit of thorough cleansing,
Then will Yahweh, create—Over all the home of Mount Zion and Over her assembly, A cloud by day and a smoke, And the shining of a fire-flame, by night,—For over all the glory, shall be a canopy;
And a pavilion, shall there be For a shade by day, from the heat,—and For a refuge and for a shelter, from storm and from rain.

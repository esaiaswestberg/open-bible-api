The spirit of My Lord Yahweh, is upon me,—Because Yahweh Hath anointed me to tell good tidings to the oppressed, Hath sent me to bind up the broken-hearted, To proclaim To captives, liberty, To them who are bound, the opening of the prison;
To proclaim—The year of acceptance of Yahweh, and The day of avenging of our God: To comfort all who are mourning;
To appoint unto the mourners of Zion—To give unto them A chaplet instead of ashes, The oil of joy instead of mourning, The mantle of praise instead of the spirit of dejection,—So shall they be called The oaks of righteousness, The plantation of Yahweh: That he may get himself glory
Then shall they build the wastes of a bygone age, The desolations of former times, shall they raise up,—And they shall build anew—The cities laid waste, The desolations of generation after generation.
Then shall strangers stay and feed your flocks,—And, the sons of the foreigner, shall be your plowmen and your vinedressers.
But, ye, the priests of Yahweh, shall be called, The attendants of our God, shall ye be named,—The riches of the nations, shall ye eat, And in their glory, shall ye boast yourselves.
Instead of your shame,—double! and Instead of disgrace, they shall shout in triumph over their portion,—Therefore in their own land, shall they possess double, Joy age-abiding, shall be theirs.
For, I, Yahweh, am a lover of justice, Hating plunder, for an ascending-sacrifice, Therefore will I give their reward with faithfulness, And an age-abiding covenant, will I solemnise for them.
Then shall be known among the nations, their seed, And, their offspring, in the midst of the peoples,—All who see them, shall acknowledge them, That, they, are the seed that Yahweh hath blessed.
I will, greatly rejoice, in Yahweh, My soul shall exult in my God, For he hath clothed me with the garments of salvation, With a robe of righteousness, hath he enwrapt me,—As a bridegroom, adorneth himself with, a chaplet, And as a bride, bedecketh herself with, her jewels.
For as the earth, bringeth forth her bud, And as, a garden, causeth her seeds, to shoot forth, So, My Lord, Yahweh, will cause to shoot forth Righteousness and praise before all the nations.

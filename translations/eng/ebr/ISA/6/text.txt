In the year that King Uzziah died, I saw My Lord, sitting upon a throne high and lifted up, and, his skirts, did fill the temple,
Seraphim, were standing above him; six wings severally, had each one,—With twain, he covered his face And with twain, he covered his feet And with twain, he did fly.
And they continued crying out one to another, and said, Holy—holy—holy, is Yahweh of hosts,—the fulness of the whole earth, is his glory.
And the foundations of the porch, were moved at the voice of him that cried,—and the house, was filled with smoke.
Then said I—Woe to me!—for I am undone, Because a man of unclean lips, am, I, And in the midst of a people of unclean lips, do I dwell,—For the King. Yahweh of hosts, have mine eyes seen!
Then flew unto me one of the seraphim, And in his hand, a live coal,—With tongs, had he taken it from off the altar.
Then touched he my mouth, and said—Lo! this hath touched thy lips,—Thus shall be taken away, thine iniquity, And, thy sin, by propitiation be covered.
Then heard I the voice of My Lord, saying, Whom shall I send? And who will go for us? And I said—Here am I—send me.
Then said he—Go and say unto this people,—Hear on but do not discern, See on but do not perceive:
Stupefy thou the heart of this people, And their ears, make thou heavy, And their eyes, overspread,—Lest they see with their eyes And with their ears, should hear, And their heart should discern and come back. And they be healed.
Then said I—How long, My Lord? And he said—Until the time that Cities be wasted through having no inhabitant And houses—through having no men, And, the ground, be laid waste unto desolation;
And Yahweh have far removed men,—And great! be the abandonment in the midst of the land.
Yet still shall there be in it a tenth, Though it again be consumed,—Like an oak and like a terebinth Which when felled, have a stock in them, A holy seed, shall be the stock thereof.

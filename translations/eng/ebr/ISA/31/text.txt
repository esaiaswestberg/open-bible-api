Alas! for them who are going down to Egypt for help, On horses, would rely,—And have trusted—In chariots—because they are many, and In horsemen, because they are very bold, But have not looked unto the Holy One of Israel, And onto Yahweh, have not sought.
But, he also, is wise, and hath brought in calamity, And his own words, hath he not set aside,—Therefore will he rise up, Against the house of evil-doers, and Against the help of the workers of iniquity.
Now, the Egyptians, are, men, and not, GOD, And, their horses, flesh, and not, spirit; When, Yahweh, shall stretch out his hand, Then, he that is giving help, shall stumble And, he that is receiving help, shall fall, And, together, shall, all of them, vanish!
For Thus, hath Yahweh said unto me—Like as a lion or a young lion growleth over his prey. Who—though there be called out against him a multitude of shepherds—Will not at their voice, be dismayed, Nor, at their noise, be daunted, So, will Yahweh of hosts come down, to make war over Mount Zion, and over the hill thereof.
As little mother-birds hovering, so, will Yahweh of hosts throw a covering over Jerusalem,—Covering, so will he rescue, Passing over, so will he deliver!
Return ye unto him against whom the sons of Israel have deeply revolted,
For in that day, will every man reject his idols of silver, and his idols of gold,—Which your hands had made for you as a sin!
Then shall the Assyrian fall, by the sword, not of a great man, And the sword, not of a mean man, shall devour him,—Howbeit he shall take his flight from the face of a sword, And his young men, shall come under tribute;
And his own Cliff, through terror, shall he pass by, And his princes shall be dismayed at an ensign,—Declareth Yahweh. Who hath a flame in Zion, And hath a furnace in Jerusalem.

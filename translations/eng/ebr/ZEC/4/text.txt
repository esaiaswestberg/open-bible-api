And once more the messenger who was speaking with me, roused me up, just as a man might be roused up out of his sleep.
Then said he unto me, What canst thou see? And I said—I have looked, and lo! a Lampstand—all of gold, with the Bowl thereof upon the top thereof, and its Seven Lamps upon it, Seven Pipes each, to the lamps which are upon the top thereof;
and, Two Olive-trees, by it,—one upon the right hand of the bowl, and one upon the left hand thereof.
Then responded I, and said unto the messenger who was speaking with me, saying,—What are these, my lord?
Then answered the messenger who was speaking with me, and said unto me, Knowest thou not what these, are? And I said, No my lord.
Then responded he, and spake unto me, saying, This, is the word of Yahweh, unto Zerubbabel, saying,—Not by wealth, nor by strength, but by my spirit, saith Yahweh of hosts.
Who, art, thou, O great mountain? Before Zerubbabel, [brought down] to a plain! So shall he bring forth the headstone, with thundering shouts Beautiful! Beautiful! thereunto.
Then came the word of Yahweh unto me, saying:
The hands of Zerubbabel, have founded this house, and, his hands, shall finish it,—So shalt thou know that, Yahweh of hosts, hath sent me unto you.
For who hath despised the day of small things? Yet shall they rejoice, when they see the plummet-stone in the hand of Zerubbabel,—these seven! The eyes of Yahweh, they are—running to and fro throughout all the earth.
Then responded I, and said unto him,—What are these two olive-trees, upon the right of the lampstand, and upon the left thereof?
And I responded a second time, and said unto him,—What are the two branches of the olive- trees which join the two golden tubes, which empty out of them the golden oil?
And he spake unto me, saying, Knowest thou not what these are? And I said, No, my lord.
Then said he, These, are the two Anointed Ones,—who stand near the Lord of all the earth.

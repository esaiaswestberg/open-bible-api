I exhort, therefore, first of all, that there be made—supplications, prayers, intercessions, thankgivings, in behalf of all men,
In behalf of kings, and all them who are, in eminent station; in order that, an undisturbed, and quiet life, we may lead, in all godliness and gravity:
This, is comely and acceptable before our Saviour God,
Who willeth, all men, to be saved, and, unto a personal knowledge of truth, to come;
For there is, one, God, one, mediator also, between God and men,—a man—Christ Jesus:
Who gave himself a ransom in behalf of all,—the testimony, in its own fit times:
Unto which, I, have been appointed proclaimer and apostle—Truth I speak, I utter no falsehood—a teacher of nations, in faith and truth.
I am minded, therefore, that—the men in every place be offering prayer, uplifting hands of lovingkindness, apart from anger and disputings;
In the same way, that, the women, in seemly attire, with modesty and sober-mindedness, be adorning themselves,—not with plaitings and ornamentation of gold, or with pearls, or with costly apparel,—
But, which becometh women promising godliness, through means of good works.
Let, a woman, in quietness, be learning in all submission;
But, teaching—unto a woman, I do not permit, nor yet to have authority over a man,—but to be in quietness;
For, Adam, first was formed, then Eve,
And, Adam, was not deceived, whereas, the woman, having been wholly deceived, hath come to be, in transgression;
She shall be saved, however, through means of the child-bearing,—if they abide in faith, and love, and holiness, with sobermindedness. Faithful, the saying.

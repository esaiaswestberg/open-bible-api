For this cause I Paul, the prisoner of Yahushua the Messiah for you Gentiles,
If ye have heard of the dispensation of the favour of יהוה which is given me to you-ward:
How that by revelation he made known unto me the mystery; (as I wrote afore in few words,
Whereby, when ye read, ye may understand my knowledge in the mystery of the Messiah)
Which in other ages was not made known unto the sons of men, as it is now revealed unto his holy apostles and prophets by the Spirit;
That the Gentiles should be fellowheirs, and of the same body, and partakers of his promise in the Messiah by the gospel:
Whereof I was made a minister, according to the gift of the favour of יהוה given unto me by the effectual working of his power.
Unto me, who am less than the least of all saints, is this favour given, that I should preach among the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of the Messiah;
And to make all men see what is the fellowship of the mystery, which from the beginning of the world hath been hid in יהוה, who created all things by Yahushua the Messiah:
To the intent that now unto the principalities and powers in heavenly places might be known by the assembly the manifold wisdom of יהוה,
According to the eternal purpose which he purposed in the Messiah Yahushua our Master:
In whom we have boldness and access with confidence by the faith of him.
Wherefore I desire that ye faint not at my tribulations for you, which is your glory.
For this cause I bow my knees unto the Father of our Master Yahushua the Messiah,
Of whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named,
That he would grant you, according to the riches of his glory, to be strengthened with might by his Spirit in the inner man;
That the Messiah may dwell in your hearts by faith; that ye, being rooted and grounded in love,
May be able to comprehend with all saints what is the breadth, and length, and depth, and height;
And to know the love of the Messiah, which passeth knowledge, that ye might be filled with all the fulness of יהוה.
Now unto him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power that worketh in us,
Unto him be glory in the assembly by the Messiah Yahushua throughout all ages, world without end. amein.

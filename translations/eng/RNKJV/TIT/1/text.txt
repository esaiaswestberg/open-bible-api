Paul, a servant of יהוה, and an apostle of Yahushua the Messiah, according to the faith of יהוה's elect, and the acknowledging of the truth which is after reverence;
In hope of eternal life, which Elohim, who does not lie, promised before the world began;
But hath in due times manifested his word through preaching, which is committed unto me according to the commandment of Elohim our Saviour;
To Titus, mine own son after the common faith: Favour, mercy, and peace, from יהוה the Father and the Master Yahushua the Messiah our Saviour.
For this cause left I thee in Crete, that thou shouldest set in order the things that are wanting, and ordain elders in every city, as I had appointed thee:
If any be blameless, the husband of one wife, having faithful children not accused of riot or unruly.
For a bishop must be blameless, as the steward of יהוה; not selfwilled, not soon angry, not given to wine, no striker, not given to filthy lucre;
But a lover of hospitality, a lover of good men, sober, just, set-apart, temperate;
Holding fast the faithful word as he hath been taught, that he may be able by sound doctrine both to exhort and to convince the gainsayers.
For there are many unruly and vain talkers and deceivers, specially they of the circumcision:
Whose mouths must be stopped, who subvert whole houses, teaching things which they ought not, for filthy lucre's sake.
One of themselves, even a prophet of their own, said, The Cretians are alway liars, evil beasts, slow bellies.
This witness is true. Wherefore rebuke them sharply, that they may be sound in the faith;
Not giving heed to Jewish fables, and commandments of men, that turn from the truth.
Unto the pure all things are pure: but unto them that are defiled and unbelieving is nothing pure; but even their mind and conscience is defiled.
They profess that they know יהוה; but in works they deny him, being abominable, and disobedient, and unto every good work reprobate.

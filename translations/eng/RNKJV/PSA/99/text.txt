יהוה reigneth; let the people tremble: he sitteth between the cherubims; let the earth be moved.
יהוה is great in Zion; and he is high above all the people.
Let them praise thy great and terrible name; for it is holy.
The king's strength also loveth judgment; thou dost establish equity, thou executest judgment and righteousness in Jacob.
Exalt ye יהוה our Elohim, and worship at his footstool; for he is holy.
Moses and Aaron among his priests, and Samuel among them that call upon his name; they called upon יהוה, and he answered them.
He spake unto them in the cloudy pillar: they kept his testimonies, and the ordinance that he gave them.
Thou answeredst them, O יהוה our Elohim: thou wast an El that forgavest them, though thou tookest vengeance of their inventions.
Exalt יהוה our Elohim, and worship at his holy hill; for יהוה our Elohim is holy.

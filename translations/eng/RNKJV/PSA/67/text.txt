Elohim be merciful unto us, and bless us; and cause his face to shine upon us; Selah.
That thy way may be known upon earth, thy saving health among all nations.
Let the people praise thee, O Elohim; let all the people praise thee.
O let the nations be glad and sing for joy: for thou shalt judge the people righteously, and govern the nations upon earth. Selah.
Let the people praise thee, O Elohim; let all the people praise thee.
Then shall the earth yield her increase; and Elohim, even our own Elohim, shall bless us.
Elohim shall bless us; and all the ends of the earth shall fear him.

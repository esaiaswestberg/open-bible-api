I love יהוה, because he hath heard my voice and my supplications.
Because he hath inclined his ear unto me, therefore will I call upon him as long as I live.
The sorrows of death compassed me, and the pains of hell got hold upon me: I found trouble and sorrow.
Then called I upon the name of יהוה; O יהוה, I beseech thee, deliver my soul.
Gracious is יהוה, and righteous; yea, our Elohim is merciful.
יהוה preserveth the simple: I was brought low, and he helped me.
Return unto thy rest, O my soul; for יהוה hath dealt bountifully with thee.
For thou hast delivered my soul from death, mine eyes from tears, and my feet from falling.
I will walk before יהוה in the land of the living.
I believed, therefore have I spoken: I was greatly afflicted:
I said in my haste, All men are liars.
What shall I render unto יהוה for all his benefits toward me?
I will take the cup of salvation, and call upon the name of יהוה.
I will pay my vows unto יהוה now in the presence of all his people.
Precious in the sight of יהוה is the death of his saints.
O יהוה, truly I am thy servant; I am thy servant, and the son of thine handmaid: thou hast loosed my bonds.
I will offer to thee the sacrifice of thanksgiving, and will call upon the name of יהוה.
I will pay my vows unto יהוה now in the presence of all his people,
In the courts of יהוה's house, in the midst of thee, O Jerusalem. Praise ye יהוה.

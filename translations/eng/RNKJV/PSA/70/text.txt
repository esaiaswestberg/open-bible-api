Make haste, O Elohim, to deliver me; make haste to help me, O יהוה.
Let them be ashamed and confounded that seek after my soul: let them be turned backward, and put to confusion, that desire my hurt.
Let them be turned back for a reward of their shame that say, Aha, aha.
Let all those that seek thee rejoice and be glad in thee: and let such as love thy salvation say continually, Let Elohim be magnified.
But I am poor and needy: make haste unto me, O Elohim: thou art my help and my deliverer; O יהוה, make no tarrying.

Put a horn to your mouth. He comes like an eagle against the house of Jehovah, because they have broken My covenant and have sinned against My law.
Israel shall cry to Me, My God, we know You.
Israel has thrown off good; the enemy shall pursue him.
They have set up kings, but not by Me. They have made rulers, but I did not know. They made idols for themselves with their silver and their gold, so that they may be cut off.
O Samaria, your calf has cast you off. My anger is kindled against them. Until when will they not attain purity?
For it also came from Israel: The craftsman made it, but it is not God. For the calf of Samaria shall be splinters.
For they sow the wind, and they reap the whirlwind. He has no stalk; the bud shall make no flour. If it does make it , strangers will swallow it up.
Israel is swallowed up. They are now among the nations as a vessel in which is no pleasure.
For they have gone up to Assyria, a wild ass alone by himself. Ephraim has hired lovers.
Yes, though they have hired among the nations, now I will gather them. And they began to be few, from the burden of the king of rulers.
Because Ephraim has made many altars to sin, they are altars to him to sin.
I will write the great things of My law for him. They were counted as a strange thing.
They sacrifice flesh for the sacrifices of My offerings, and they eat. Jehovah did not accept them. Now He will remember their iniquity and punish their sins. They shall return to Egypt.
For Israel has forgotten his Maker, and builds temples. And Judah has multiplied fortified cities. But I will send a fire on his cities, and it shall burn up her palaces.

Paul and Silvanus and Timothy to the church of Thessalonians in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ: Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
We give thanks to God always concerning you all, making mention of you on our prayers,
remembering without ceasing your work of faith and labor of love, and the patience of hope of our Lord Jesus Christ before our God and Father,
knowing brothers, beloved by God, your election.
For our gospel did not come to you in word only, but also in power, and in the Holy Spirit, and in much assurance, even as you know what kind we were among you for your sake.
And you became imitators of us and of the Lord, welcoming the Word in much affliction with joy of the Holy Spirit.
So that you became examples to all those believing in Macedonia and Achaia.
For the Word of the Lord sounded out from you not only in Macedonia and Achaia, but also in every place your faith toward God has gone out, so that there is no need for us to have to say anything.
For they themselves announce concerning us what kind of entrance we have to you, and how you had turned to God from the idols, to serve the true and living God,
and to await His Son from Heaven, whom He raised from the dead, Jesus, the One delivering us from the wrath to come.

And He said to me, Son of man, stand on your feet, and I will speak to you.
And the Spirit entered into me as He spoke to me, and He made me stand on my feet, and I heard Him speaking to me.
And He said to me, Son of man, I am sending you to the sons of Israel, to the nations, the rebelling ones who have rebelled against Me. They and their fathers have transgressed against Me to this day.
And the sons are stiff of face and hard of heart. I am sending you to them. And you shall say to them, So says the Lord Jehovah.
And they, whether they will hear or whether they will forbear (for they are a rebellious house), yea, they shall know that a prophet has been among them.
And you, son of man, do not be afraid of them and of their words. Do not be afraid, though briers and thorns are with you, and though you are living among scorpions. Do not be afraid of their words, and do not be frightened by their faces, though they are a house of rebellion.
And you shall speak My words to them, whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear, for they are rebellious.
But you, son of man, hear what I am saying to you. Do not be like that rebellious house of rebellion. Open your mouth and eat what I am giving to you.
And I looked, and behold, a hand was extended to me. And behold, a roll of a book was in it.
And He spread it before me, and it was written on the face and the back. And written on it were weepings, and mourning, and woe.

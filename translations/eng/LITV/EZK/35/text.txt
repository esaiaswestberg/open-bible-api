And the word of Jehovah was to me, saying,
Son of man, set your face against Mount Seir, and prophesy against it.
And say to it, So says the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I am against you, Mount Seir, and I will stretch My hand against you, and I will make you a ruin and a waste.
I will lay your cities waste, and you shall be a ruin. And they shall know that I am Jehovah.
Because there was to you never-ending enmity, and you poured out the sons of Israel to the hands of the sword in the time of their calamity, in the time of the iniquity of the end.
Therefore, As I live, declares the Lord Jehovah, surely for blood I appoint you, and blood shall pursue you. Since you have not hated blood, so blood shall pursue you.
And I will make Mount Seir a ruin and a waste, and cut off from it the one passing through, and the one returning.
And I will fill his mountains with his slain. In your hills and in your valleys, and in your every torrent, the slain by the sword shall fall in them.
I will make you ruins forever, and your cities shall not be inhabited. And you shall know that I am Jehovah.
Because you have said, these two nations and these two lands will be mine, and we shall possess it (yet Jehovah was there),
so, As I live, declares the Lord Jehovah, I will act by your anger and by envy which you have done out of your hatred against them, and I will be known among them when I have judged you.
And you shall know that I am Jehovah. I have heard all your revilings which you have spoken against the mountains of Israel, saying, Desolation! They are given to us for food!
And you magnified with your mouth against Me and have multiplied your words against Me; I have heard.
So says the Lord Jehovah: As all the earth rejoices, I will make you a ruin.
As you rejoiced at the inheritance of the house of Israel because of desolation, so I will do to you. You shall be a ruin, O Mount Seir, and all Edom, all of it! And they shall know that I am Jehovah.

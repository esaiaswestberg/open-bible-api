Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ through the will of God, to the saints being in Ephesus and faithful in Christ Jesus:
Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
Blessed is the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenlies with Christ,
according as He chose us in Him before the foundation of the world, for us to be holy and without blemish before Him in love,
predestinating us to adoption through Jesus Christ to Himself, according to the good pleasure of His will,
to the praise of the glory of His grace in which He favored us in the One having been loved,
in whom we have redemption through His blood, the forgiveness of sins, according to the riches of His grace
which He caused to abound toward us in all wisdom and understanding,
making known to us the mystery of His will, according to His good pleasure which He purposed in Himself,
for the administration of the fullness of the times to head up all things in Christ, both the things in the heavens, and the things on earth, in Him,
in whom we also have been chosen to an inheritance, being predestinated according to the purpose of the One working all things according to the counsel of His own will,
for us to be to the praise of His glory, the ones who had previously trusted in Christ;
in whom also you, hearing the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation, in whom also believing you were sealed with the Holy Spirit of promise,
who is an earnest of our inheritance, to the redemption of the purchased possession, to the praise of His glory.
Because of this, hearing of your faith in the Lord Jesus and love toward all the saints,
I also do not cease giving thanks on your behalf, making mention of you in my prayers,
that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give to you a spirit of wisdom and revelation in the full knowledge of Him,
the eyes of your mind having been enlightened, for you to know what is the hope of His calling, and what the riches of the glory of His inheritance in the saints,
and what is the surpassing greatness of His power toward us, the ones believing according to the working of His mighty strength
which He worked in Christ in raising Him from the dead; yea, He seated Him at His right hand in the heavenlies, Psa. 110:1
far above all principality, and authority, and power, and lordship, and every name being named, not only in this age, but also in the coming age ;
and He "put all things under His feet" and gave Him to be Head over all things to the church, Psa. 8:6
which is His body: the fullness of Him filling all things in all;

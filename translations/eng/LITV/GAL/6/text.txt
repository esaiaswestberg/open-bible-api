Brothers, if a man is taken in some fault, you, the spiritual ones, restore such a one in the spirit of meekness, considering yourself, that you not also be tempted.
Bear one another's burdens, and so you will fulfill the law of Christ.
For if anyone thinks to be something, he deceives himself, being nothing.
But let each one prove his work, and then he alone will have a boast in himself and not as to another.
For each one will bear his own load.
But let the one being taught in the word share with the one teaching, in all good things.
Do not be deceived, God is not mocked. For whatever a man may sow, that he also will reap.
For the one sowing to his flesh will reap corruption of the flesh. But the one sowing to the Spirit will reap everlasting life from the Spirit.
But we should not weaken in doing good, for in due time we shall reap, if we do not faint.
So then, as we have time, let us work good toward all, and especially toward the household of the faith.
See in what large letters I write to you with my hand.
As many as desire to look well in the flesh, these compel you to be circumcised, only that they may not be persecuted for the cross of Christ.
For they themselves having been circumcised do not even keep the Law, but they desire you to be circumcised so that they may boast in your flesh.
But may it never be for me to boast, except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom the world has been crucified to me, and I to the world.
For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision has any strength nor uncircumcision, but a new creation.
And as many as shall walk by this rule, peace and mercy be on them and on the Israel of God.
For the rest, let no one give troubles to me, for I bear in my body the brands of the Lord Jesus.
The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit, brothers. Amen.

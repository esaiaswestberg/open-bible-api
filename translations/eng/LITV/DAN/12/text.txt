And at that time, Michael shall stand up, the great ruler who stands for the sons of your people. And there shall be a time of distress, such as has not been from the existence of a nation until that time. And at that time, your people shall be delivered, everyone that shall be found written in the Book.
And many of those sleeping in the earth's dust shall awake, some to everlasting life, and some to reproaches and to everlasting abhorrence.
And those who are wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament, and those turning many to righteousness as the stars forever and ever.
But you, O Daniel, shut up the words and seal the book, to the end time. Many shall run to and fro, and knowledge shall be increased.
And I, Daniel, looked. And, behold! Another two stood there, the one on this side , and one on that side of the river's edge.
And one said to the man clothed in linen, who was on the waters of the river, Until when is the end of the wonders?
And I heard the man clothed in linen, who was on the waters of the river, when he held up his right and his left hand to the heavens and swore by Him who lives forever, that it shall be for a time, times, and a half. And when they have made an end of scattering the power of the holy people, all these things shall be finished.
And I heard, but I did not understand. And I said, O my lord, what shall be the end of these things ?
And He said, Go, Daniel! For the words are closed up and sealed until the end time.
Many shall be purified and made white and tested. But the wicked shall do wickedly. And not one of the wicked shall understand, but the wise shall understand.
And from the time the regular sacrifice shall be taken away, and the abomination that desolates set up, a thousand, two hundred and ninety days shall occur .
Blessed is he who waits and comes to the thousand, three hundred and thirty five days.
But you go on to the end, for you shall rest and stand for your lot at the end of the days.

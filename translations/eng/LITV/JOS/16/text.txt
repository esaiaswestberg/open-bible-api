And the lot of the sons of Joseph went out from the Jordan at Jericho, to the waters of Jericho eastward, to the wilderness which went from Jericho to the hills of Bethel.
And it went from Bethel to Luz, and passed on to the border of the Archites, to Ataroth;
and went down westward to the border of the Japhletites, to the border of Beth-horon the lower, and to Gezer, and its boundary line was at the sea.
And Manasseh and Ephraim, the sons of Joseph, inherited.
And the border of the sons of Ephraim was by their families; the border of their inheritance on the east was Ataroth-addar to Beth-horon the upper.
And the border went out at the sea to Michmethah on the north; and the border went around eastward to Taanath-shiloh, and passed by it eastward to Janohah;
and went down from Janohah to Ataroth, and to Naarath, and touched on Jericho, and went out at the Jordan.
From Tappuah, the border went westward to the river Kanah, and its boundary line was at the sea. This is the inheritance of the tribe of the sons of Ephraim, for their families.
And the separate cities of the sons of Ephraim were in the midst of the inheritance of the sons of Manasseh, all the cities and their villages.
And they did not expel the Canaanite who lived in Gezer. And the Canaanite lives in the midst of Ephraim to this day, and is serving under tribute.

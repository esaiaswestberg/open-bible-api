And David said in his heart, I shall now perish one day by the hand of Saul. Nothing is better for me than that I speedily escape to the land of the Philistines. And Saul will despair of me, to still seek me in all the border of Israel. And I shall escape out of his hand.
And David rose up and crossed over, he and six hundred men who were with him, to Achish the son of Maoch, the king of Gath.
And David lived with Achish in Gath, he and his men, each one and his household: David and his two wives, Ahinoam of Jezreel, and Abigail the former wife of Nabal of Carmel.
And it was told to Saul that David had fled to Gath, and he did not seek for him any more.
And David said to Achish, Please, if I have found favor in your eyes, they shall give to me a place in one of the cities of the field, and I shall live there. Yea, why should your servant live in the royal city with you?
And Achish gave Ziklag to him in that day. Therefore, Ziklag has been counted to the kings of Judah until this day.
And the number of days which David lived in the field of the Philistines was a year and four months.
And David and his men went up and attacked the Geshurites, and the Gezrites, and the Amalekites. For they were the inhabitants of the land from the past days , as you come into Shur and into the land of Egypt.
And David struck the land, and did not keep alive man, or woman, and took sheep, and oxen, and asses, and camels, and clothing, and turned back and came to Achish.
And Achish said, Did you not make raids today? And David said, Against the south of Judah, and against the south of the Jerahmeelites, and to the south of the Kenites.
David did not keep alive man or woman to bring news to Gath, saying, Lest they speak against us, saying, So David has done; And so has been his custom all the days that he has lived in the fields of the Philistines.
And Achish trusted David, saying, Surely he has made himself to be hated among his people in Israel, and has become my servant forever.

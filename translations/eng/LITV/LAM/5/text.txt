O Jehovah, remember what has been to us; look upon and see our shame.
Our inheritance has been turned to aliens, our houses to foreigners.
We are orphans. There is no father; our mothers are like widows.
We have drunk our water for silver; our wood comes for a price.
We are pursued; we grow weary; rest is not given to us.
We have given the hand to the Egyptians, to the Assyrian, in order to be satisfied with bread.
Our fathers have sinned, and we are not; we have borne their iniquities.
Slaves rule over us; there is no rescuer from their hand.
We bring in our bread with our souls, from the face of the sword of the wilderness.
Our skin is burned black like an oven, because of the fever heat of famine.
They raped the women in Zion, virgins in the cities of Judah.
Rulers were hanged by their hands; the faces of the elders were not honored.
They lifted the young men to the hand mill, and the youths stumbled at the wood.
The elders have ceased from the gate, the young men from their music.
The joy of our heart has ceased; our dance has turned to mourning.
The crown has fallen from our head. Woe now to us, for we have sinned!
For this our heart is faint; our eyes are dim for these things .
Zion is laid waste on the mountain; foxes walk about on it.
O Jehovah, You remain forever; Your throne to generation and generation.
Why do You forget us forever, forsake us the length of days?
Return us to You, O Jehovah, and we shall return. Renew our days as of old,
unless You have utterly rejected us; You are exceedingly angry against us.

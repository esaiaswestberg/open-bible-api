And I again lifted up my eyes and looked, and, behold, a flying scroll!
And he said to me, What do you see? And I answered, I see a flying scroll; its length is twenty cubits, and its width ten cubits.
And he said to me, This is the curse that goes forth over the face of the whole earth. For from now on everyone who steals shall be cut off according to it; and everyone who swears from now on shall be cut off according to it.
And I will bring it forth, says Jehovah of hosts. And it shall go into the house of the thief, and into the house of the one who swears falsely by My name. And it shall remain in the midst of his house, and shall devour it, and its timber, and its stones.
Then the angel who was speaking with me went out, and said to me, Now lift up your eyes and see what this is that goes forth.
And I said, What is it? And he said, This is the ephah that goes forth. And he said, This is their form in all the earth.
And, behold, a lead cover was lifted up, and a woman was sitting in the middle of the ephah.
And he said, This is wickedness. And he threw her into the midst of the ephah; and he threw the lead stone over its opening.
And I lifted up my eyes and looked. And, behold, two women came out. And the wind was in their wings; for they had wings like the wings of the stork. And they lifted up the ephah between the earth and the heavens.
And I said to the angel who was speaking with me, Where are they going with the ephah?
And he said to me, To build a house for it in the land of Shinar; and it shall be fixed and established there on its own place.

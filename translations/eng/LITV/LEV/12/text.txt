And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,
Speak to the sons of Israel, saying, If a woman has conceived seed, and has borne a male, then she shall be unclean seven days; as on the days of her menstrual impurity she shall be unclean.
And on the eighth day the flesh of his foreskin shall be circumcised.
And she shall remain in the blood of her cleansing thirty three days; she shall not touch any holy thing, and she shall not go into the sanctuary, until the days of her cleansing are fulfilled.
And if she bears a female, then she shall be unclean two weeks, as in her menstruation; and she shall continue in the blood of her cleansing sixty six days.
And when the days of her cleansing are fulfilled for son or for daughter, she shall bring in a lamb, a son of a year, for a burnt offering, and a young dove or a turtledove for a sin offering, to the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, to the priest.
And he shall bring it near before Jehovah, and shall atone for her; and she shall be cleansed from the fountain of her blood; this is the law of her who bears, whether a male or a female.
And if her hand is not able to find a lamb, then she shall take two turtle doves, or two young doves one for a burnt offering, and one for a sin offering, and the priest shall atone for her; and she shall be cleansed.

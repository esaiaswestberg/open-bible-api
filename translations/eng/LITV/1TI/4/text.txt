But the Spirit expressly says that in latter times some will depart from the faith, cleaving to deceiving spirits and teachings of demons,
in lying speakers in hypocrisy, being seared in their own conscience,
forbidding to marry, saying to abstain from foods, which God created for partaking with thanksgiving by the believers and those knowing the truth.
Because every creature of God is good, and nothing to be thrust away, but having been received with thanksgiving;
for through God's Word and prayerful intercourse, it is sanctified.
Having suggested these things to the brothers, you will be a good minister of Jesus Christ, having been nourished by the words of faith, and by the good doctrine which you have followed.
But refuse the profane and old-womanish tales. And exercise yourself to godliness.
For bodily exercise is profitable to a little, but godliness is profitable to all things, having promise of the present life and of that coming.
Faithful is the Word and worthy of all acceptance;
for to this we also labor and are reproached, because we hope on the living God, who is deliverer of all men, especially of believers.
Enjoin and teach these things.
Let no one despise your youth, but become an example of the believers in word, in conduct, in love, in spirit, in faith, in purity.
Until I come, attend to reading, to exhortation, to teaching.
Do not be neglectful of the gift in you, which was given to you through prophecy, with laying on of the hands of the elderhood.
Give care to these things; be in these things in order that your progress may be plain in all.
Give attention to yourself and to the doctrine; continue in them, for doing this, you will both deliver yourself and those hearing you.

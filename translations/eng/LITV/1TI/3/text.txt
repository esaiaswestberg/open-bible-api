Faithful is the Word: If anyone reaches out to overseership, he desires a good work.
Then it behooves the overseer to be blameless, husband of one wife, temperate, sensible, well-ordered, hospitable, apt at teaching;
not a drinker, not a contentious one, not greedy of ill gain, but gentle, not quarrelsome, not loving money;
ruling his own house well, having children in subjection with all respect.
But if anyone does not know to rule his own house, how will he care for a church of God?
He should not be a novice, lest being puffed up he may fall into the Devil's judgment.
But he must also have a good witness from those outside, that he not fall into reproach and into a snare of the Devil.
Likewise, deacons to be reverent, not double-tongued, not addicted to much wine, not greedy of ill gain,
having the mystery of the faith with a pure conscience.
And also let these be tested first, then let them serve, being without reproach.
Likewise, their wives to be reverent, not slanderers, temperate, faithful in all things.
Let deacons be husbands of one wife, ruling their own households and children well.
For those having served well gain a good grade for themselves and much boldness in faith, those in Christ Jesus.
I write these things to you, hoping to come to you shortly.
But if I delay, that you may know how to behave in the house of God, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and foundation of the truth.
And confessedly, great is the mystery of godliness: God was manifested in flesh, was justified in Spirit, was seen by angels, was proclaimed among nations, was believed on in the world, was taken up in glory.

And Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said:
Shall one try a word with you, you who are weary? But who can hold back with words?
Behold, you have instructed many; and you have made weak hands strong.
Your words have upheld him who was falling, and you have made feeble knees strong.
But now it has come upon you, and you faint. It touches you, and you are troubled.
Is not your reverence your hope; your hope the uprightness of your ways?
I beg you, remember, Who ever perished, being innocent? Or where were the righteous cut off?
As I have seen, the ones who plow iniquity and sow misery reap the same.
They perish from the breath of God, and by the blast of His anger they are consumed.
The lion roars; and the voice of the lion and the teeth of the young lions are broken;
the old lion is perishing for lack of prey; and the lioness' offspring are scattered.
Now a word was stolen to me, and my ear received a whisper of it.
In thoughts from the visions of the night, when deep sleep falls on men,
fear and trembling met me, and made my many bones dread.
Then a spirit passed before my face; the hair of my flesh stood up;
it stood still, but I could not discern its form; an image was before my eyes; there was silence; then I heard a voice:
Shall mortal man be more just than God? Shall a man be purer than his Maker?
Behold, He puts no trust in His servants; and He charges His angels with folly!
How much more those that dwell in houses of clay; whose foundation is in the dust; they crush them before the moth!
They are shattered from morning till evening; they perish forever with no one regarding.
Is not their tent cord pulled up within them? They die, but not with wisdom.

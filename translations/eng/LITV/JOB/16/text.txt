And Job answered and said:
I have heard many such things . You are all miserable comforters.
Is there an end to windy words? Or what provokes you that you answer?
I also could speak as you. If your soul were in the place of my soul, I could bind words against you and shake at you with my head.
I might make you strong with my mouth, and the moving of my lips could spare you.
If I speak, my pain is not held back; and though I forbear, what ease do I get?
But now He has made me weary. You have made all my company desolate.
And You have plucked me; for it is a witness, and my failure rises up against me; and it answers to my face.
His anger has torn, and hated me ; He gnashes at me with His teeth; my enemy sharpens His eyes at me.
They have gaped at me with their mouth, and scornfully struck my cheek; they gather themselves together against me.
God has delivered me to the perverse; and He has turned me over into the hands of the wicked.
I was at ease, but He has shattered me; yea, He has also taken hold on my neck and broken me to bits; and He has set me up as a target for Him.
His archers surround me; He splits my inward parts and has no pity; He pours out my gall on the ground
He breaks me with break on top of break; He runs on me like a warrior.
I have sewed sackcloth on my skin, and I have thrust my horn in the dust.
My face is reddened from weeping; and the shadow of death is on my eyelids,
though no violence is in my hand, and my prayer is pure.
O earth, do not cover my blood, and let not my cry have a place.
Even now, behold! My witness is in Heaven; and He who testifies of me is on high.
My scorners are my friends; my eye pours out tears to God.
O that one might plead for a man with God, as a man pleads for his friend!
For years few in number will come; and I shall not return the way I shall go.

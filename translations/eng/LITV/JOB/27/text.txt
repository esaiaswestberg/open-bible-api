And Job continued the uplifting of his discourse, and said:
As God lives, He has taken away my judgment; yea, the Almighty has made my soul bitter.
As long as my breath is in me, and the spirit of God is in my nostrils,
my lips shall not speak wickedness, nor my tongue utter deceit.
Far be it from me that I should justify you. Until I die, I shall not retract my integrity from me.
I hold fast by my righteousness, and I will not abandon it; my heart shall not shame me any of my days.
Let my enemy be like the wicked and he who rises against me as the perverse.
For what is the hope of the ungodly when He cuts off, when God pulls out his soul?
Will God hear his cry when distress comes upon him?
Will he delight in the Almighty? Will he call on God at every time?
I will teach you by the hand of God; that which is with the Almighty I will not hide.
Behold, all of you have seen it yourselves; when then do you become vain with this vanity?
This is the portion of a wicked man with God, and the inheritance of ruthless men that they shall receive from the Almighty.
If his sons become numerous, the sword is for them; and his offspring shall not be satisfied with bread.
Those remaining of him shall be buried in death, and his widows shall not weep.
Though he heaps up silver like the dust, and prepares clothing like the clay;
he may prepare, but the just shall put it on; and the innocent shall divide the silver.
He builds his house like a moth, and like a booth that a watchman makes.
The rich man shall lie down, but he shall not be gathered; he opens his eyes, and he is not.
Fears shall overtake him like waters; a tempest steals him away in the night.
The east wind lifts him up and he is gone; for it whirls him out of his place.
For it will hurl at him, and will not spare; from its hand he will surely flee.
He shall clap His hands at him, and shall hiss him from his place.

And Jehovah answered Job and said:
Shall a reprover contend with the Almighty? He who reproves God, let him answer it.
Then Job answered Jehovah and said:
Behold, I am vile! What shall I answer You? I will put my hand to my mouth.
Once I have spoken, but I will not answer; yea, twice, but I will go no further.
And Jehovah answered Job out of the tempest and said:
Now gird up your loins like a man, and I will question you; and you teach Me.
Will you also set aside My judgment; will you condemn Me so that you may be justified?
And have you an arm like God; or can you thunder with a voice like His?
Adorn yourself with majesty now, and with grandeur, and clothe yourself with glory and honor;
pour forth the outbursts of your anger; yea, look on everyone who is proud, and bring him down low;
look on everyone who is proud, and humble him, and trample the wicked in their place;
hide them in the dust together; bind their faces in darkness.
Then I also will confess to you that your right hand can save you.
Now behold Behemoth, which I made along with you; he eats grass like an ox;
see, now, his strength is in his loins, and his force in the muscles of his belly;
he hangs his tail like a cedar; the sinews of his thighs are knit together;
his bones are like tubes of bronze; his bones like bars of iron;
he is the first in the ways of God; his Maker brings near his sword.
For the mountains yield food for him, and all the beasts of the field play there.
He lies under the lotus, in the hiding-place of the reed and the marsh;
the lotus trees cover him in its shadow; the willows of the torrent circle him.
Behold, he is confident, even if Jordan burst forth against his mouth.
Shall any take him before his eyes, or pierce his nose with snares?

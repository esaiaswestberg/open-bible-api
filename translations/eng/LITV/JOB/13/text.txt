Behold, my eye has seen all this; my ear has heard and understood it.
As you know, I also know; I do not fall short of you.
Surely I would speak to the Almighty, and I desire to argue with God.
But you are imputers of lies; you are all worthless healers.
Oh that you would stop speaking entirely; and it would be your wisdom!
Hear now my reasoning, and listen to the arguments of my lips.
Would you speak unrighteously for God and speak deceitfully for Him?
Will you lift up His face, or will you contend for God?
Or as one man mocks another, do you mock Him? Is it good that He should search you out?
He will surely reprove you if you secretly lift up faces.
Shall not His highness make you afraid, and His dread fall on you?
Your remembered sayings are like ashes; surely your backs are backs of clay.
Be silent from me, that I may speak; and let what will pass over me.
Why do I take my flesh in my teeth and put my life in my hand?
Behold, He will cut me off; I will not wait, but I will justify my ways before His face.
He also is my salvation, for an ungodly one shall not come before Him.
Listen carefully to my words, and let what I say be in your ears;
Behold now, I have set my cause in order; I know that I shall be justified.
Who is he who will strive with me? For then I would be quiet and die.
Only two things do not do to me, O God ; then I will not hide myself from Your face:
Remove Your palm from me, and let not Your terror make me afraid.
Then call, and I will answer; or let me speak, and reply to me.
How many are my iniquities and sins? Make me know my transgressions and my sin.
Why do You hide Your face and count me for Your enemy?
Will You terrify a leaf driven to and fro? Will you pursue the dry stubble?
For You write bitter things against me and make me inherit the sins of my youth.
You also put my feet in the stocks, and watch all my paths; You set a limit on the soles of my feet.
And he wears out like a rotten thing, like a garment which a moth eats.

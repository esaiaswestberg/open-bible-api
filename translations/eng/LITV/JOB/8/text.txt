And Bildad the Shuhite answered, saying:
Until when will you speak these things, since the words of your mouth are like a mighty wind?
Or does God pervert judgment? Or does the Almighty pervert the right?
If your sons have sinned against Him, and if He has sent them away in the hand of their transgression,
if you would seek earnestly to God, and make your prayer to the Almighty,
if you were pure and upright, surely now He would rise for you, and make whole the abode of your righteousness.
And your beginning was small, yet your end would greatly increase.
For, I beg you, ask of the former generation, and prepare to the search of their fathers;
for we are but of yesterday, and we know nothing because our days on earth are a shadow.
Shall they not teach you, and tell you, and bring words out of their heart?
Can the rush grow up without mire? Can the reed grass grow without water?
While it is yet in its greenness, and not cut down, it dries out before every plant.
So are the paths of all those forgetting God; and the hope of the ungodly shall perish;
whose hope is cut off, and his trust as a spider's house.
He shall lean on his house, but it shall not stand; he shall hold fast to it, but it shall not endure.
He is moist before the sun, and his branches shoot forth on his garden.
His roots are wrapped around a heap; he sees a house of stones.
If one destroys him from his place, then it shall deny him, saying I have not seen you!
Behold this is the joy of His way, and out of the earth others shall grow.
Behold, God will not cast away the innocent, and He will not help the evildoers,
until He fills your mouth with laughter, and your lips with rejoicing.
Those who hate you shall be clothed with shame; and the tent of the wicked shall not be .

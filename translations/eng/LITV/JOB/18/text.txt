And Bildad the Shuhite answered and said:
Until when will you set a snare for words? Consider, and afterwards we will speak.
Why are we counted as animals? Are we stupid in your eyes?
One tearing himself in his anger, shall the earth be forsaken for your sake? Or shall the rock move from its place?
Yes, the light of the wicked shall be put out; and the spark of his fire shall not blaze.
The light shall be dark in his tent; and his lamp shall be put out above him;
the steps of his strength shall be hampered; and his own counsel shall tumble him.
For he is sent into a net by his own feet; and he is walking on a snare;
the trap shall take him by the heel; a noose shall prevail over him;
the pitfall is hid for him in the ground, and a trap for him on the way.
Terrors frighten him on every side and shall dash him at his feet.
His strength shall be hunger-bitten, and calamity shall be ready at his side.
It devours parts of his skin; the first-born of death eats his parts.
His hope shall be rooted out of his tent, and you marched to the king of terrors.
What is not his shall dwell in his tent; brimstone is scattered on his home.
His roots are dried up beneath, and his branch shall wither above.
His memory perishes from the earth, and there is no name to him on the face of the street.
They push him from light to darkness, and they make him flee from the world.
He shall have no son nor kinsman among his people, nor any remnant in his dwellings.
Those after him shall be amazed at his day; and those before were seized with horror.
Surely these are the tents of the perverse, and this the place that has not known God.

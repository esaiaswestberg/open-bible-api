And Jonah prayed to Jehovah his God out of the belly of the fish.
And he said, I cried out to Jehovah from my distress. And He answered me. Out of the belly of Sheol I cried for help, and You heard my voice.
For You cast me into the deep, into the heart of the seas, and the current surrounded me; all Your breakers and Your waves passed over me.
And I said, I am cast off from Your eyes; yet I will again look to Your holy temple.
Waters encompassed me, even to my soul; the depth closed around me; seaweed was clinging to my head.
I went down to the bases of the mountains; the earth with her bars was about me forever. But You brought up my life from the pit, O Jehovah my God.
When my soul fainted within me, I remembered Jehovah; and my prayer came to You, to Your holy temple.
Those who observe vanities of idolatry forsake their faithfulness;
but I will sacrifice to You with the voice of thanksgiving; I will fulfill that which I have vowed. Salvation belongs to Jehovah!
And Jehovah spoke to the fish, and it vomited Jonah out onto the dry land.

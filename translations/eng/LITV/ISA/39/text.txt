At that time Merodach-baladan, the son of Baladan, king of Babylon, sent letters and a present to Hezekiah For he had heard that he was ill, and was made strong.
And Hezekiah was glad because of them and let them see the house of his treasure, the silver, and the gold, and the spices, and the good oil, and all his weapons, and all that was found in his treasuries; there was nothing in his house or in all his kingdom that Hezekiah did not let them see.
And Isaiah the prophet came to king Hezekiah and said to him, What did these men say? And from where did they come to you? And Hezekiah said, They have come from a distant land to me, from Babylon.
Then he said, What have they seen in your house? And Hezekiah said, They have seen all that is in my house; there is not a thing among my treasures that I have not made them see.
And Isaiah said to Hezekiah, Hear the word of Jehovah of Hosts:
Behold, days come when all that is in your house, even what your fathers have treasured up until now, shall be carried to Babylon; nothing shall be left, says Jehovah.
And they shall take of your sons who shall issue from you, which you shall father; and they shall be eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon.
Then Hezekiah said to Isaiah, The word of Jehovah that you have said is good. And he said, For there shall be peace and truth in my days.

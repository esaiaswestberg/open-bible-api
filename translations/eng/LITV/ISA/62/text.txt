For Zion's sake, I will not be silent; and for Jerusalem's sake, I will not rest; until her righteousness goes forth as brightness, and her salvation as a burning lamp.
And nations shall see your righteousness, and all kings your glory. And you shall be called by a new name which the mouth of Jehovah shall name.
You also shall be a crown of beauty in the hand of Jehovah, and a royal diadem in the palm of your God.
You no longer shall be called Forsaken; nor shall your land any longer be called Desolate. But you shall be called, My Delight is in Her; and your land, Married. For Jehovah delights in you, and your land is married.
For as a young man marries a virgin, so shall your sons marry you. And as a bridegroom rejoices over the bride, so your God shall rejoice over you.
I have set watchmen on your walls, O Jerusalem. All the day and all the night they shall not always be silent; you who remember Jehovah, do not let a pause be to you.
And give no pause to Him until He sets up and makes Jerusalem a praise in the earth.
Jehovah has sworn by His right hand, and by the might of His arm: Surely I will no longer give your grain as food for your enemies; and the sons of a stranger shall not drink your new wine for which you have labored.
But those who have gathered it shall eat it, and praise Jehovah. And they who have collected it shall drink it in My holy courts.
Pass! Pass through the gates; prepare the way of the people! Raise up! Raise up the highway; clear it from stones; lift up a banner over the peoples.
Behold, Jehovah has made it to be heard to the end of the earth; Tell the daughter of Zion, Behold! Your salvation comes! Behold! His reward is with Him, and His work before Him.
And they shall call them, The Holy People, the Redeemed of Jehovah. And to you it shall be called, Sought Out, A City Not Forsaken.

Where has your Beloved gone, most beautiful among women? Where has your Beloved turned? For we seek Him along with you.
My Beloved has gone down to His garden, to the terraces of spices, to feed in the gardens and to gather lilies.
I am my Beloved's, and my Beloved is mine. He feeds among the lilies.
O My love, you are as beautiful as Tirzah, as lovely as Jerusalem, awesome as bannered armies.
Turn away your eyes from Me, because they have overcome Me. Your hair is like a flock of goats that lie down from Gilead.
Your teeth are like a flock of ewes which come up from the washing place, of which they all are bearing twins, and barrenness is not among them.
Your temples behind your veil are like a piece of pomegranate.
Sixty of them are queens, and eighty concubines, and virgins without number.
But My dove, My perfect one is one alone . She is the only one to her mother; she is the choice of the one who bore her. The daughters saw her and called her blessed; the queens and the concubines saw her, and they praised her.
Who is she who looks down like the dawn, beautiful as the moon, clear as the sun, awesome as bannered armies ?
I went down to the garden of nut trees, to see the greenery of the ravine, to see whether the vine flowered and the pomegranates budded.
I did not know, but my soul set me on the chariots of My princely people.
Return, return, O Shulamite! Return, return, that we may gaze upon you. What will you see in the Shulamite? As it were the dance of two army camps.

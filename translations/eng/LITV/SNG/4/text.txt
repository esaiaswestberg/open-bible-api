Behold, you are beautiful, My love. Behold, you are beautiful; your eyes are as doves' from behind your veil. Your hair is like a flock of goats which lie down from Mount Gilead.
Your teeth are like a flock of shorn sheep which come up from the washing place; of which they all are bearing twins; and barrenness is not among them.
Your lips are like a cord of scarlet, and your speech is becoming; your temples are like a piece of pomegranate behind your veil.
Your neck is like the tower of David, built for an armory; a thousand bucklers hang on it, all the shields of the mighty men.
Your two breasts are like two fawns, twins of a gazelle, feeding among the lilies.
Until when the day blows, and the shadows flee away, I myself will go to the mountain of myrrh, and to the hills of frankincense.
You are all beautiful, My love. There is no blemish on you.
Come with Me from Lebanon, My spouse; with Me from Lebanon. Look from the top of Amana, from the top of Shenir and Hermon, from the lions' dens, from the mountains of the leopards.
You have ravished My heart, My sister, My spouse; you have ravished My heart with one of your eyes, with one chain of your neck.
How beautiful are your loves, My sister, My spouse! How much better are your loves than wine, and the scent of your ointments than all spices!
Your lips, My spouse, drip like the honeycomb; honey and milk are under your tongue. And the scent of your garments is like the scent of Lebanon.
A locked garden is My sister, My spouse; a rock heap locked up, a sealed fountain.
Your plants are an orchard of pomegranates with excellent fruits, with henna and spikenard;
spikenard and saffron, calamus and cinnamon; with all trees of frankincense, myrrh and aloes; with all the chief balsam spices;
a fountain of gardens, a well of living waters; even flowings from Lebanon.
Awake, north wind ; yea, come, south wind ; blow on my garden; let its spices flow out. Let my Beloved come into His garden and eat its excellent fruits.

I am a rose of Sharon, a lily of the valleys.
As a lily among thorns, so is My love among the daughters.
As the apple among the trees of the forest, so is my Beloved among the sons. I delighted in His shadow, and I sat down; and His fruit was sweet to my taste.
He brought me to the house of wine, and His banner over me was love.
Feed me with raisin cakes, refresh me with apples, for I am sick with love.
His left hand is under my head, and His right hand embraces me.
I adjure you by the gazelles, and by the does of the field, O daughters of Jerusalem, that you do not stir up and do not awaken the Beloved until it pleases.
The voice of my Beloved! Behold, He comes leaping on the mountains, skipping on the hills.
My Beloved is likened to a gazelle, or to a young deer, the stag. Behold, He stands behind our wall, looking from the windows, peering from the lattice.
My Beloved answered and said to me, Arouse yourself, My love, My beautiful one, and come away.
For, behold, the winter has passed, the rain has passed, it goes to itself.
The flowers appear on the earth; the time of singing has come; and the voice of the turtledove is heard in our land.
The fig tree spices her unripe figs, and the vines give a fragrance by the blossom. Arise, My love; come, My beautiful one, and come yourself.
My dove, in the clefts of the rock, in the secrecy of the steep place, let Me see your form. Let Me hear your voice; for your voice is sweet, and your form is beautiful.
Take for us the foxes, the little foxes that spoil the vines; and our vineyards have blossoms.
My Beloved is mine, and I am His. He feeds among the lilies.
Until when does the day blow, and the shadows flee away? Turn, my Beloved, and be like a gazelle, or a young deer, the stag, on the cleft mountains.

How beautiful are your feet in sandals, O prince's daughter! The curves of your thighs are like jewels, the work of the hands of a skillful worker.
Your navel is like a round goblet; it never lacks mixed wine. Your belly is like a heap of wheat set about with lilies.
Your two breasts are like two fawns, twins of a gazelle.
Your neck is like an ivory tower; your eyes like the fishpools in Heshbon, by the gate of Bathrabbim. Your nose is like a tower of Lebanon, peering toward the face of Damascus.
Your head is like Carmel, and the hair of your head like purple cloth; the King is held captive in its tresses.
How beautiful and how pleasant you are in delights, O love!
Your stature compares to a palm tree, and your breasts to clusters of grapes.
I said, I will go up in the palm tree; I will take hold of its stalk. And please let your breasts be like clusters of the vine, and the scent of your nose like apples,
and the roof of your mouth like the best wine going down smoothly, for my Beloved, flowing softly over the lips of sleeping ones.
I am my Beloved's, and His desire is toward me.
Come, my Beloved, let us go forth into the field; let us stay in the villages.
Let us rise up early to the vineyards; let us see if the vine flowers and the blossom opens, and the pomegranates bud forth. There I will give my loves to You.
The love apples give a scent, and over our doors are all excellent fruits ; new, also old, I have laid up for You, my Beloved.

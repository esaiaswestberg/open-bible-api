Paul, a slave of God and an apostle of Jesus Christ according to the faith of the elect of God and full knowledge of the truth according to godliness,
on hope of eternal life which the God who does not lie promised before the eternal times,
but revealed in its own times in a proclamation of His word, with which I was entrusted by the command of our Savior God:
to Titus, a true child according to our common faith. Grace, mercy, peace from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ our Savior.
For this cause I left you in Crete, that you might set in order the things lacking and appoint elders in every city, as I ordered you:
If anyone is blameless, husband of one wife, having faithful children, not in accusation of loose behavior, or disobedient,
(for the overseer must be blameless as a steward of God), not self-pleasing, not prone to anger, not given to wine, not a quarreler, not greedy of ill gain;
but hospitable, a lover of good, discreet, just, holy, temperate,
clinging to the faithful word according to the teaching, that he may be able both to encourage by sound doctrine and to convict the ones contradicting.
For there are indeed many disobedient men, empty talkers and mind-deluders, especially those of the circumcision,
whose mouth you must stop, who overturn whole houses, teaching things which they ought not for the sake of ill gain.
One of them, a prophet of their own, said: Cretans are always liars, evil beasts, lazy gluttons.
This testimony is true; for which cause convict them severely, that they may be sound in the faith,
not listening to Jewish myths and commandments of men, having turned away from the truth.
Truly, all things are pure to the pure, but to the ones having been defiled and unbelieving, nothing is pure, but even their mind and conscience has been defiled.
They profess to know God, but by their works they deny Him , being abominable and disobedient, and worthless to every good work.

So I returned and considered all the oppressions that are done under the sun. And behold the tears of those who were oppressed, and they had no comforter! And at the hand of those who oppressed them was power; but there was no comforter to them.
And I commended the dead who already have died, more than the living who are alive until now.
Yea, better than both is he who has not yet been, who has not seen the evil work that is done under the sun.
And I considered every labor, and every advantage of the work, that it is the envy of a man against his neighbor; this is also vanity and striving after wind.
The fool folds his hands together and eats his own flesh.
Better is a palm filled with rest, than two fists with labor and striving after wind.
Then I returned and saw vanity under the sun.
There is one alone , and there is not a second; yea, he has neither son nor brother; and there is no end to all his labor; even his eyes are not satisfied with riches; and he says , For whom do I labor, and take good from my soul? This is also vanity. Yes, it is an evil task.
Two are better than one; because they have a good reward for their labor.
For if they fall, this one will lift up his fellow. But woe to him, the one that falls, and there is not another to lift him up.
Also if two lie together , then they have warmth; but for one, how is he warm?
And if one overthrows him, two shall withstand him; and a threefold cord is not quickly torn apart.
A poor and a wise child is better than the old and stupid king who does not know to be warned any more.
For from the house of the imprisoned he goes forth to reign, although in his kingdom he was born poor.
I saw all the living who walk about under the sun, with the second child who shall stand up in his place.
There is no end to all the people, to all who have been before them; they also who come after shall not rejoice with him. Surely this is also vanity and striving after wind.

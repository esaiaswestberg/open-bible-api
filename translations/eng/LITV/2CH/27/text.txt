Jotham was a son of twenty five years when he began to reign, and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem; and the name of his mother was Jerushah, the daughter of Zadok.
And he did the right in the eyes of Jehovah, according to all that his father Uzziah did; only, he did not come into the temple of Jehovah; and the people continued to do wickedly.
He built the Upper Gate of the house of Jehovah, and he built very much in the wall of Ophel;
and he built cities in the hills of Judah, and in the forests he built palaces and towers.
He also fought with the king of the sons of Ammon, and. prevailed over them. And the sons of Ammon gave to him in that year a hundred talents of silver, and ten thousand kors of wheat, and ten thousand of barley; this the sons of Ammon turned over to him in the second year and in the third.
And Jotham made himself strong, for he had prepared his ways before Jehovah his God.
And the rest of the acts of Jotham, and all his battles, and his ways, behold, they are written in the Book of the Kings of Israel and Judah.
He was a son of twenty five years when he began to reign, and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem.
And Jotham lay with his fathers and they buried him in the city of David. And his son Ahaz reigned in his place.

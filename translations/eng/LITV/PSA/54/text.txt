To the Chief Musician on Neginoth. A Contemplation; A Psalm of David, when the Ziphites came and said to Saul, Does not David hide himself among us? Save me, O God, by Your name; and judge me by Your strength.
Hear my prayer, O God; listen to the words of my mouth.
For strangers have risen up against me; and terrifying men seek after my soul; they have not set God before them. Selah.
Behold, God is my helper. The Lord is with those who uphold my soul.
He shall reward evil to my enemies; cut them off in Your truth.
I will freely sacrifice to You; I will praise Your name, O Jehovah, for it is good.
For He has delivered me out of all trouble; and my eye has seen its desire on my enemies.

To the chief musician. A Psalm and Song of David. To You silence is praise, O God, in Zion; and to You is a vow paid.
To You who hears prayer, all flesh comes.
Things of iniquity, our transgressions, are mightier than I; You atone for them.
Blessed is the one You choose and cause to come near You; he shall dwell in Your courts; we shall be satisfied with the goodness of Your house, Your holy temple.
You will answer us in righteousness by awesome things, O God of our salvation; the Confidence of all the ends of the earth and the sea, of those afar off.
By Your strength the mountains are established, banded together with might.
You still the roaring of the sea, the roar of their waves, and the tumult of the peoples.
And the inhabitants of the uttermost parts are afraid of Your signs; You make the outgoings of the morning and the evening to rejoice.
You visit the earth and water it; You greatly enrich it; the river of God is full of water. You provide their grain, for in this way You have prepared it.
You fill its terraces with water. You deepen its furrows. You make it soft with showers. You bless the sprouting of it.
You crown the year of Your goodness, and Your tracks drop with fruitfulness.
The pastures of the wilderness drop, and the little hills gird themselves with joy.
The meadows are outfitted with flocks; the valleys are also covered with grain; they shout for joy and sing.

A Psalm of David. O Jehovah, who shall dwell in Your tabernacle? Who shall live in Your holy mountain?
He who walks uprightly and works righteousness, and speaks the truth in his heart.
He does not backbite with his tongue, nor do evil to his friend, nor lift up a reproach against his neighbor.
In his eyes, the reprobate has been despised, but he honors those who fear Jehovah: He has sworn to his hurt, and will not change it.
He has not given his silver at interest; nor has he taken a bribe against the innocent; he who does these things shall not be shaken forever.

A Song of Ascents. In my distress I cried to Jehovah, and He answered me.
O Jehovah, deliver my soul from lying lips, from a deceitful tongue.
What shall be given to you, or what shall one add to you, O false tongue?
Sharp arrows of the mighty with coals of broom!
Woe is me that I sojourned in Meshech; I dwell with the tents of Kedar!
My soul has long dwelt to itself, with him who hates peace.
I am for peace; but when I speak, they are for war.

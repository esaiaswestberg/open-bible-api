To the chief musician. For the sons of Korah; A song. For the Virgins. God is our refuge and strength, very much found to be a help in distresses.
On account of this we will not fear when the earth changes and when mountains are slipping into the heart of the seas.
Let its waters foam; let the mountains shake in its swelling. Selah.
There is a river, its channels gladden the city of God, the holy tabernacles of the Most High.
God is in the midst of her; she shall not be shaken; God will help her at the turning of the morning.
The nations roared; kingdoms were shaken; He gave forth His voice and the earth melted.
Jehovah of hosts is with us; the God of Jacob is a refuge for us. Selah.
Come, behold the works of Jehovah, who sets ruins on the earth,
causing to cease wars to the end of the earth; He breaks the bow and cuts apart spears; He burns the chariots in the fire.
Be still and know that I am God! I will be exalted among the nations; I will be exalted in the earth.
Jehovah of hosts is with us; the God of Jacob is a refuge for us. Selah.

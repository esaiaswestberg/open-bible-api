To the chief musician. A Psalm of David. The king rejoices in Your strength, O Jehovah; and how greatly does he rejoice in Your salvation.
You have given him his heart's desire and have not withheld the prayer of his lips. Selah.
For You will precede him with the blessings of goodness; You set a crown of pure gold on his head.
He asked life from You: You gave to him length of days forever and ever.
His glory is great in Your salvation; You have laid honor and majesty on him.
For You have set him blessings forever; You have rejoiced him in the joy of Your face.
For the king trusts in Jehovah, and in the mercy of the Most High; he will not be shaken.
Your hand shall find out all Your enemies; Your right hand shall find out Your haters.
You shall set them as a fiery furnace in the time of Your presence; Jehovah will swallow them up in His wrath, and the fire will devour them.
You shall destroy their fruit from the earth, and their seed from the sons of men.
For they stretched forth evil against You; they imagined a plot; they cannot prevail,
for You shall make them turn the back; against their faces You shall make ready Your arrows on Your strings.
Be exalted, O Jehovah, in Your strength; we will sing, and sing psalms of Your power.

A Song of Ascents. I will lift up my eyes to the hills; from where shall my help come?
My help comes from Jehovah, the Maker of the heavens and the earth.
He will not give your foot to slip; He who keeps you will not slumber.
Behold, He who keeps Israel will not slumber nor sleep.
Jehovah is your keeper; Jehovah is your shade on your right hand.
The sun shall not strike you by day, nor the moon by night;
Jehovah shall keep you from all evil; He shall keep your soul.
Jehovah shall keep your going out, and your coming in, from now on and till forever.

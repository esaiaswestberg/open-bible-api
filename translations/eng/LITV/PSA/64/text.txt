To the chief musician. A Psalm of David. O God, hear my voice in my complaint; guard my life from the terror of the enemy.
Hide me from the council of those who injure, from the tumult of evildoers,
who sharpen their tongue like a sword; they tread their arrows, a bitter word,
so that they may shoot at the innocent from a lurking place; suddenly they shoot at him, and fear not.
They make themselves strong in an evil plan; they talk of laying snares secretly; they say, Who shall see them?
They search into injustice, saying , We have finished a well laid plan. Yea, the inward part of man and the heart are deep!
But God shall shoot an arrow at them; their wounds shall suddenly appear.
So they shall be confounded; their tongue falls upon themselves; everyone seeing them shall flee.
And all men shall fear and shall declare the work of God; yea, they shall in wisdom consider His work.
The righteous shall rejoice in Jehovah, and shall trust in Him; and all the upright in heart shall glory.

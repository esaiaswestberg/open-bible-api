A Psalm of David. Blessed be Jehovah my Rock, who teaches my hands for war, my fingers for battle.
He is my mercy and my fortress, my high tower and my deliverer, my shield, and in Him I take refuge, in Him who humbles my people under me.
O Jehovah, what is man that You know him; the son of man, that you esteem him?
Man is like to vanity; his days are like a shadow that passes.
Bow down Your heavens, O Jehovah; and come down; touch the mountains and they shall smoke.
Flash out lightning and scatter them; send out Your arrows and confound them.
Send Your hand from above; rescue me and deliver me out of great waters, from the hand of a foreigner's sons,
whose mouths have spoken vanity; and their right hand is a right hand of lies.
I will sing a new song to You, O God; I will sing praises to You on a harp of ten strings ,
You who gives salvation to kings, who delivers His servant David from the evil sword.
Rescue me and deliver me from the foreigners' sons, those whose mouths have spoken vanity; and their right hand is a right hand of lies;
so that our sons may be like plants grown up in their youth; and our daughters like corner-stones hewn like a palace building;
and our storehouses may be full, furnishing kind to kind; our flocks may breed thousands and ten thousands outside,
our oxen laden; there is no break and no going out, and no crying in our plazas.
Blessed are the peoples that are so; blessed are the peoples whose God is Jehovah!

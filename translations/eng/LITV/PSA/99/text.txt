Jehovah reigns; let the peoples tremble; He sits between the cherubs; let the earth quake.
Jehovah is great in Zion; and He is high above all the peoples.
They shall thank Your great and fearful name; it is holy.
The king's strength also loves judgment; You establish uprightness; You worked judgment and righteousness in Jacob.
Exalt Jehovah our God and worship at His footstool; He is holy.
Moses and Aaron were among His priests; and Samuel was among those who called on His name; they called to Jehovah, and He answered them.
He spoke to them in the cloudy pillar; they kept His testimonies and the law that He gave to them.
You answered them, O Jehovah our God; to them You were a God who forgives, but taking vengeance on their works.
Exalt Jehovah our God and worship at His holy hill; for Jehovah our God is holy.

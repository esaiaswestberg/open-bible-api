To the chief musician. A Testimony. Concerning the Lilies. A Psalm of Asaph. Give ear, O Shepherd of Israel, You leading Joseph like a flock; shine forth, You dwelling between the cherubs.
Stir up Your might before Ephraim, and Benjamin, and Manasseh, and come for salvation.
O God, turn us again, and make Your face shine, and we will be saved!
O Jehovah God of Hosts, until when will You smoke against the prayer of Your people?
You made them eat with the bread of tears; yea, You made them drink with tears a third time.
You make us a strife for our neighbors, and our enemies laugh to themselves.
O God of hosts, turn us again, and cause Your face to shine, and we will be saved.
You have led a vine out of Egypt; You have cast out the nations, and have planted it.
You cleared before it, and You have rooted its roots; and it has filled the land.
The hills were covered with its shadow; and its boughs were as the cedars of God.
It was sending its boughs out to the sea, and its branches to the River.
Why have You broken down its walls, so that it is plucked by all who pass by the way?
A boar out of the forest wastes it, and the beast of the field feeds on it.
O God of hosts, we beg You, return! Look down from Heaven and see and visit this vine,
and the vineyard which Your right hand has planted, and on the Son You made strong for Yourself.
It is burned with fire, cut down; they perish at the rebuke of Your face.
Let Your hand be on the Man of Your right hand; on the Son of man whom You have made strong for Yourself.
So we will not backslide from You; make us live, and we will call on Your name.
O Jehovah, God of hosts, turn us again! Cause Your face to shine, and we will be saved.

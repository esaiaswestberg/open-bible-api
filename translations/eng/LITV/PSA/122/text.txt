A Song of Ascents; of David. I was glad when they said to me, Let us go into the house of Jehovah.
Our feet shall stand within your gates, O Jerusalem.
Jerusalem is built like a city that is joined to itself, together.
There the tribes go up, the tribes of Jehovah; to the testimony of Israel; to give thanks to the name of Jehovah.
For the thrones of judgment were established there, the thrones of the house of David.
Pray for the peace of Jerusalem; those who love you shall prosper.
Peace be within your walls; prosperity in your towers.
Because of my brothers and my companions, I will now say, Peace be in you.
Because of the house of Jehovah, our God, I will seek your good.

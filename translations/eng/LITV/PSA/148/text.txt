Praise Jehovah! Praise Jehovah from the heavens; praise Him in the heights.
Praise Him, all His angels; praise Him, all His hosts.
Praise Him, sun and moon; praise Him, all you stars of light.
Praise Him, O heavens of heavens; and O waters that are above the heavens.
Let them praise the name of Jehovah; for He commanded, and they were created.
And He established them forever and ever; He gave a decree that they not pass away.
Let the sea-monsters and all deeps praise Jehovah from the earth,
fire and hail, snow and smoke, stormy wind fulfilling His word,
mountains and all hills, fruitful trees and all cedars,
beasts and all livestock, creeping things and birds of the wing,
kings of the earth and all people, princes and all judges of the earth,
young men and virgins too, old men and youths.
Let them praise the name of Jehovah; for His name alone is exalted; His glory is above the earth and heavens.
He also lifts up the horn of His people, the praise of all His saints, of the sons of Israel, a people near to Him, Praise Jehovah.

I love Jehovah because He hears my voice, my prayers.
Because He has bowed His ear to me, I will also call in my days.
The cords of death hemmed me in; and the pains of Sheol found me; I find distress and sorrow;
then I call on the name of Jehovah: O Jehovah, I beseech You, deliver my soul!
Jehovah is gracious and righteous; yea, our God is merciful.
Jehovah keeps the simple; I was low, but He saved me.
Return to your rest, O soul; for Jehovah has blessed you.
For You have delivered my soul from death, my eye from tears, my feet from stumbling.
I will walk before the face of Jehovah in the lands of the living.
I believed; so I speak; I was greatly afflicted;
I said in my alarm, All men are liars.
What shall I return to Jehovah for His benefits to me?
I will lift up the cup of salvation, and I will call on the name of Jehovah.
I will pay my vows to Jehovah now in the presence of all His people.
Precious in the eyes of Jehovah is the death of His saints.
O Jehovah, truly I am Your servant now; I am Your servant, the son of Your handmaid; You have loosed my bonds.
I will sacrifice to You the sacrifice of thanks and will call on the name of Jehovah.
I will pay my vows to Jehovah now in the presence of all His people,
in the courts of the house of Jehovah; in your midst, O Jerusalem. Praise Jehovah!

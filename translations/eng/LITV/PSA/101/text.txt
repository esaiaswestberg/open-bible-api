A Psalm of David. I will sing of mercy and judgment; to You O Jehovah, I will sing praise.
I will behave myself wisely in a perfect way; O when will You come to me? I will walk in the integrity of my heart in the midst of my house.
I will set no wicked thing before my eyes; I have hated the work of those who turn aside; it shall not fasten upon me.
A perverse heart shall depart from me; I will not know evil.
Whoever secretly slanders his neighbor, I will cut him off; I will not endure him who has high eyes and a proud heart.
My eyes shall be on the faithful of the land, so that they may dwell with me; he who walks in a perfect way shall serve me.
He who works falsely shall not live inside my house; he who speaks lies shall not be established before my eyes.
In the mornings I will cut off all the wicked of the land, so that I may cut off all the evil workers from the city of Jehovah.

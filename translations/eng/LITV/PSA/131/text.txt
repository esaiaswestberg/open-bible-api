A Song of Ascents. Of David. O Jehovah, my heart is not proud, nor have my eyes been lofty; nor have I walked in great things, nor in things too wondrous for me.
Surely I have set myself and have quieted my soul, like one weaned by its mother; my soul on me is like one weaned.
Let Israel hope in Jehovah, from now and till forever.

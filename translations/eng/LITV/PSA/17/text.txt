A Prayer of David. O Jehovah, hear righteousness; listen to my cry; give ear to my prayer, for it is not in lips of deceit.
Let my judgment go out from Your face; Your eyes see uprightly.
You will test my heart; You will visit in the night; You will refine me; You will find nothing; my thoughts do not pass beyond my mouth.
As to the work of men, by the words of Your lips I keep from the paths of the violent.
My steps have kept in Your tracks, so that my strides have not slipped.
I have called on You, for You will answer me, O God; bow down Your ear to me and hear my word.
Set out your wonderful loving-kindness by Your right hand, O Savior of those who trust in You , from those rising against them .
Keep me as the pupil, the daughter of the eye; hide me in the shadow of Your wings,
from the face of the wicked who stripped me; against my soul, my enemies go all around me.
They are enclosed in their own fat; their mouth speaks proudly;
now they have hemmed in our steps; they set their eyes to cast me to the earth;
like a lion who longs to tear, and like a young lion sitting in hidden dens.
Arise, O Jehovah, go before his face and bow him down! Deliver my soul from the wicked, by Your sword,
from men, by Your hand, O Jehovah, from men of the world whose portion is in this life, and their belly You fill with Your treasure; they are satisfied with sons, and will leave their riches to their babes.
As for me, in righteousness I will look upon Your face; when I awaken, I shall be satisfied by Your image.

Praise Jehovah! Praise God in His holy place; praise Him in the expanse of His might.
Praise Him in His mighty acts; praise Him according to His excellent greatness.
Praise Him with the sound of the trumpet; praise Him with the harp and lyre.
Praise Him with the timbrel and dance; praise Him with strings and pipes.
Praise Him on the sounding cymbals; praise Him with the resounding cymbals.
Let everything that breathes praise Jehovah. Praise Jehovah!

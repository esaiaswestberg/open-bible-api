A Psalm of David. I will thank You with my whole heart; I will sing praise to You before the gods;
I will worship toward Your holy temple, and give thanks to Your name for Your mercy, and for Your truth; for You have magnified Your word above all Your name.
You answered me in the day that I cried; You emboldened me in my soul with strength.
All the kings of the earth shall thank You, O Jehovah, because they have heard the words of Your mouth.
Yes, they shall sing in the ways of Jehovah; for the glory of Jehovah is great.
Though Jehovah is high, yet He looks upon the lowly; but the proud He knows from afar.
If I walk in the midst of distress, You give me life; You send out Your hand against the wrath of my enemies, and Your right hand delivers me.
Jehovah will perfect His work in me; O Jehovah, Your mercy endures forever; You will not forsake the works of Your hands.

A Song of Ascents. Of David. Behold! How good and how pleasant is the living of brothers, even in unity.
It is like the precious oil on the head that ran down on the beard, Aaron's beard, going down to the mouth of his garments;
like the dew of Hermon coming down on the mountains of Zion; for there Jehovah commanded the blessing: life till everlasting.

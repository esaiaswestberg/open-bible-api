Why have the nations raged and the peoples are meditating on vanity?
The kings of the earth set themselves; yea, the rulers have plotted together against Jehovah and His anointed, saying ,
We will break their bands in two, and throw off their cords from us.
He who sits in the heavens shall laugh; Jehovah shall mock at them.
Then He will speak to them in His anger, and He will terrify them in His wrath;
Yea, I have set My king on My holy mount on Zion.
I will declare concerning the statute of Jehovah: He said to Me, You are My Son. Today I have begotten You.
Ask of Me, and I will give the nations as Your inheritance; and the uttermost parts of the earth as Your possession.
You shall break them with a rod of iron; You shall dash them in pieces like a potter's vessel.
Now, then, be wise, O kings; be taught, O judges of the earth:
Serve Jehovah with fear; yea, rejoice with trembling.
Kiss the Son, lest He be angry, and you perish from the way, when His wrath is kindled but a little. Oh the blessings of all those who flee to Him for refuge!

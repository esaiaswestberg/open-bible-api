A Psalm of David. Give to Jehovah, sons of mighty ones; give to Jehovah glory and strength.
Give to Jehovah the glory of His name; worship; Jehovah in the majesty of holiness.
The voice of Jehovah is on the waters the God of glory thunders; Jehovah is above many waters.
The voice of Jehovah is in power; the voice of Jehovah in majesty.
The voice of Jehovah breaks the cedars; yea, Jehovah breaks Lebanon's cedars.
He also makes them skip like a calf; Lebanon and Sirion like a young wild ox.
The voice of Jehovah is cutting through the flame of fire.
The voice of Jehovah shakes the wilderness; Jehovah shakes the wilderness of Kadesh.
The voice of Jehovah causes the does to calve, and He uncovers the forests. And in His temple, it all is saying, Glory!
Jehovah sits upon the flood; yea, Jehovah sits as King forever.
Jehovah will give strength to His people; Jehovah will bless His people with peace.

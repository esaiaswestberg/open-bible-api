A Psalm of Thanksgiving. Shout joyfully to Jehovah, all the land.
Worship Jehovah with gladness; come before His face with joyful singing.
Know that Jehovah, He is God; He has made us, and not we ourselves, His people and the sheep of His pasture.
Enter into His gates with thanksgiving, into His courts with praise; be thankful to Him; bless His name.
For Jehovah is good; His mercy is everlasting, and His faithfulness to generation and generation.

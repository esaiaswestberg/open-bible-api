A Song of Ascents. I will lift up my eyes on You, O Dweller in Heaven.
Behold, as the eyes of servants look to the hand of their masters; as the eyes of a maiden to the hand of her mistress; so our eyes wait on Jehovah our God, until He shows grace to us.
Be gracious to us, O Jehovah; be gracious to us! For we are exceedingly filled with scorn.
Our soul is exceedingly filled for itself with the contempt of those who are at ease, the scorn of the proud.

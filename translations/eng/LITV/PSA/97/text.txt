Jehovah reigns! Let the earth rejoice; let the multitude of islands be glad.
Clouds and darkness are all around Him; righteousness and judgment are the foundation of His throne.
A fire goes before Him and burns up His enemies all around.
His lightnings lit up the world; the earth saw and trembled.
The mountains melted like wax before the face of Jehovah, before the face of Jehovah of the whole earth.
The heavens declare His righteousness and all the people see His glory.
All who serve graven images are shamed, those who boast themselves in idols; all gods bow down before Him.
Zion heard and was glad; yea, the daughters of Judah rejoiced because of Your judgments, O Jehovah.
For You, Jehovah, are exalted above all the earth; You are lifted on high far above all gods.
You who love Jehovah, hate evil. He keeps the souls of His saints; He delivers them out of the hand of the wicked.
Light is sown for the righteous, and gladness for the upright in heart.
Be glad in Jehovah, O righteous ones; give thanks to the memory of His holiness.

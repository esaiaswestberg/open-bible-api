A Song, A Psalm for the Sons of Korah. Great is Jehovah, and exceedingly to be praised in the city of our God, His holy mountain.
Beautiful on high, the joy of all the earth, is Mount Zion, in the sides of the north, the city of the great King.
God is known in her strongholds for a refuge.
For, lo, the kings met together; they passed by together;
they saw, so they marveled; they were troubled and fled away.
Trembling and pain seized them there, like a woman in labor.
You break the ships of Tarshish with an east wind.
As we have heard, so we have seen in the city of Jehovah of hosts, in the city of our God. God establishes it forever. Selah.
We have thought on Your lovingkindness, O God, in the midst of Your temple.
According to Your name, O God, so is Your praise to the ends of the earth; Your right hand is full of righteousness.
Mount Zion shall be glad; the daughters of Judah shall shout for joy because of Your judgments.
Walk around Zion; yea, go all around it; count its towers;
set your heart on its ramparts; pass between its strongholds; in order that you may report to the coming generation.
For this God is our God forever and ever; He will be our guide even unto death.

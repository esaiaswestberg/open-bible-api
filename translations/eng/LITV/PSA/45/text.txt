To the Chief Musician, Concerning the Lilies. For the sons of Korah. A Poem; a Song of the Beloved. My heart is overflowing with a good matter. I am speaking of my works to the King; my tongue is the pen of a rapid writer.
You are the fairest of the sons of man; grace has poured into Your lips; on this account God has blessed You forever.
Gird Your sword on Your thigh, Mighty One; with Your glory and Your majesty.
And ride prosperously in Your majesty, on the matter of truth and meekness and right, and Your right hand shall teach You fearful things.
Your arrows are sharp in the heart of the King's enemies; peoples fall under You.
Your throne, O God, is forever and ever; the scepter of Your kingdom is a scepter of uprightness.
You love righteousness and hate wickedness; on account of this God, Your God, has anointed You with the oil of gladness more than Your fellows.
All Your garments smell of myrrh and aloes and cassia out of ivory palaces, by which they make You glad.
King's daughters are among Your precious ones; the queen stands at Your right hand in gold of Ophir.
Listen, O daughter, and look, and incline your ear, and forget your people and your father's house.
And the King will desire your beauty, for He is your Lord, and you shall worship Him.
And the daughter of Tyre will stroke Your face with a gift, the rich among the peoples.
The king's daughter is all glorious within, her clothing braided gold.
She shall be led to the King in embroidered work; her companions, the virgins, shall be brought to You after her.
They shall be led with gladness and rejoicing; they shall go in to the King's palace.
Your sons shall be in the place of your fathers; You will make them for rulers in all the earth.
I will make remembered Your name in every generation and generation; on this account people shall thank You forever and ever.

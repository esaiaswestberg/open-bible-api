To the chief musician. Do not destroy. A secret treasure of David, when he fled from Saul in the cave. Be merciful to me, O God, be merciful to me, for my soul trusts in You; yea, in the shadow of Your wings I will make my hiding place, until the great destruction passes by.
I will cry to God most High, to God who works for me.
He shall send from Heaven and save me; He will shame the one who crushes me. Selah. God shall send His mercy and His truth.
My soul is among lions; I lie among those on fire, the sons of men, whose teeth are spears and arrows, and their tongue a sharp sword.
Be praised above the heavens, O God; let Your glory be over the whole earth.
They have prepared a net for my steps; my soul is bowed down; they have dug a pit before me; they have fallen into it. Selah.
My heart is fixed, O God, my heart is fixed; I will sing and give praise.
Wake up my glory! Wake up, harp and lyre! I will stir the morning dawn with praise.
I will praise You among the peoples, O Lord, I will sing to You among the nations.
For Your mercy is great to the heavens, and Your truth to the clouds.
Be exalted above the heavens, O God; Your glory over the whole earth.

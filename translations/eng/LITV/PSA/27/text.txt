A Psalm of David. Jehovah is my light and my salvation; whom shall I fear? Jehovah is the strength of my life; of whom shall I be afraid?
When the evildoers, my enemies and my foes, came upon me to eat my flesh, they stumbled and fell.
If an army should camp against me, my heart shall not fear. Though war rises against me, in this I am trusting.
One thing I have asked from Jehovah, it I will seek: my dwelling in the house of Jehovah all the days of my life, to behold the delight of Jehovah, and to inquire in His temple.
For in the day of evil He shall hide me in His shelter; in the secrecy of His tabernacle, He shall hide me; He shall set me up on a rock.
And now my head shall be lifted up above my enemies, my encirclers, and I will offer sacrifices of joy in His tabernacle; I will sing, yea, I will sing praises to Jehovah.
Hear, O Jehovah, my voice when I call, and favor me, and answer me.
My heart said to You, Seek my face; Your face, O Jehovah, I will seek.
Do not hide Your face from me; Do not turn away Your servant in anger; You have been my help, do not leave me nor forsake me, O God of my salvation.
When my father and my mother forsake me then Jehovah will take me up.
Teach me Your way, O Jehovah, and lead me in a level path, because of those who watch me.
Deliver me not into the soul of my enemies; for false witnesses have risen against me, and he that puffs out violence.
I would have fainted unless I had believed to see the goodness of Jehovah in the land of the living.
Hope in Jehovah; be strong and He will make strong your heart; yea, hope in Jehovah!

A Song of Ascents, for Solomon. If Jehovah does not build the house, they who build it labor in vain; if Jehovah does not keep the city, the watchman stays awake in vain.
It is in vain for you to rise early, sit up late, to eat the bread of toils; for so He gives His beloved sleep.
Behold! Children are an inheritance of Jehovah; the fruit of the womb is His reward.
As arrows in the hand of a mighty man, so are the sons of the young.
Blessed is the man who has filled his quiver with them; they shall not be ashamed, for they shall speak with their enemies in the gate.

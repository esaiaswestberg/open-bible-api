A Song of Ascents. They who trust in Jehovah shall be like Mount Zion; it is not shaken; it remains forever.
The mountains are all around Jerusalem; and Jehovah is all around His people, from this time and forever.
For the scepter of wickedness shall not rest on the lot of the righteous; that the righteous not put forth their hands to evil.
Do good, O Jehovah, to the good, and to the upright in their heart.
And those who turn aside to their crooked ways, Jehovah shall lead them with the evildoers. Peace be upon Israel.

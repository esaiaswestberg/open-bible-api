To the chief musician. On Jeduthun. A Psalm of Asaph. My voice is to God, and I cry; my voice is to God, and He listened to me.
In the day of my distress I sought the Lord; my hand was open in the night and did not grow numb; my soul refused to be comforted.
I remember God and am troubled; I meditate and my spirit faints. Selah.
You seized the watches of my eyes; I am troubled, and I cannot speak.
I thought upon the days of old, the years of bygone ages.
I will remember my song in the night; I will speak with my own heart, and my spirit carefully searches.
Will the lord cast off forever; and will He not add to be pleased any more?
Is His mercy gone forever? Has His word failed for all generations?
Has God forgotten to be gracious; has He in anger shut up His tender mercies? Selah.
And I said, This is my sickness, the years of the right hand of the Most High;
I will remember the works of Jehovah; surely I will remember Your wonders of old.
I will also meditate on all Your works and muse of Your doings.
O God, your way is in holiness; who is a God great like God?
You are the God who does wonders; You have revealed Your strength among the peoples.
You have redeemed Your people with Your arm, the sons of Jacob and Joseph. Selah.
The waters saw You, O God, the waters saw You; they were afraid; yea, the deeps trembled.
The clouds poured out water; the skies uttered a voice; and Your arrows flew out.
The voice of Your thunder in the tempest; lightnings lit up the world; the earth trembled and quaked!
Your way is in the sea; and Your path is in the great waters; and Your footsteps are not known.
You led Your people like a flock by the hand of Moses and Aaron.

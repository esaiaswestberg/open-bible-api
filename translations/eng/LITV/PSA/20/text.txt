To the chief musician. A Psalm of David. May Jehovah answer you in the day of distress; the name of the God of Jacob set you on high.
He sends your help from the sanctuary, and upholds you out of Zion.
He will remember all your offerings, and make fat your burnt sacrifices. Selah.
He will give you according to your heart, and fulfill all your plans.
We will rejoice in your salvation, and in the name of our God set up banners; may Jehovah fulfill all your prayers.
Now I know that Jehovah saves His anointed; He answers him from His holy Heaven with the saving strengths of His right hand.
These trust in chariots, and these in horses but we will make mention in the name of Jehovah our God.
They have bowed down and have fallen, but we have risen and stand upright.
Save, O Jehovah! The King will answer us in the day of our calling.

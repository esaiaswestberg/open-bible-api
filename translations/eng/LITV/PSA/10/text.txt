Why do You stand far away, O Jehovah? Will You hide in times of distress?
The wicked in his pride will pursue the poor; they will be caught in the schemes which they have devised.
For the wicked boasts of his soul's desire, and he has blessed the covetous; he has despised Jehovah.
Through pride of his face, the wicked will not seek; there is no God in all of his schemes.
His ways are perverted at all times. Your judgments are high from his sight; as for all his vexers, he puffs at them.
He has said in his heart, I shall not be moved! From generation to generation never will I be in evil.
His mouth is full of cursing and deceit and injury; under his tongue are mischief and vanity.
He sits in the hiding places of the villages; in the secret places he murders the innocent; his eyes watch against the poor.
He lies in wait secretly like a lion in his den; he lies in ambush to catch the poor; he seizes the poor, drawing him into his net;
and being crushed, he bows; and the poor have fallen by his strong ones.
He has said in his heart, God has forgotten; He hides His face; He will not see forever.
Arise, O Jehovah! O God, lift up your hand; do not forget the lowly ones.
Why does the wicked one despise God? He has said in his heart, You will not inquire into us
You have seen, for You take note of mischief and vexation, to repay with Your hand. The poor leaves himself to You; You are the helper of the orphan.
Break the arm of the wicked and evil one; search out his wickedness until You find none.
Jehovah is king forever and ever; the nations have perished out of His land.
O Jehovah, You have heard the desire of the humble; You will prepare their heart. Your ear will hear,
judge the orphan and the crushed. No more shall the man of the earth continue to terrify.

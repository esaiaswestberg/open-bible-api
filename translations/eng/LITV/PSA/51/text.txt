To the chief musician, A Psalm of David when Nathan the prophet came to him, after he had gone in to Bathsheba. Be gracious to me, O God, according to Your loving-kindness, according to the multitude of Your tender mercies; blot out my transgressions.
Wash me completely from my iniquity, and cleanse me from my sin.
For I know my transgressions; and my sin is ever before me.
Against You, You only, I have sinned, and done evil in Your eyes; that You might be justified in Your speaking and be clear when You judge.
Behold, I was brought forth in iniquity, and in sin my mother conceived me.
Behold, You desire truth in the inward parts; and in the hidden parts You teach me wisdom.
Purge me with hyssop, and I shall be clean; wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.
Cause me to hear joy and gladness; that the bones You have crushed may rejoice.
Hide Your face from my sins, and blot out all my iniquities.
Create in me a clean heart, O God; and renew a steadfast spirit within me.
Do not cast me out from Your presence, and do not take Your Holy Spirit from me.
Restore to me the joy of Your salvation, and uphold me with a willing spirit.
Then I will teach transgressors Your ways; and sinners will turn back to You.
Deliver me from the guilt of shedding blood, O God, O God of my salvation; my tongue shall sing aloud of Your righteousness.
O Lord, open my lips and my mouth shall declare Your praise.
For you do not desire sacrifice, or I would give it ; You do not delight in burnt offering.
The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit; a broken and a contrite heart, O God, You will not despise.
Do good in Your good pleasure to Zion; build the walls of Jerusalem.
Then You shall be pleased with the sacrifices of righteousness, with burnt offering and whole offering; then they shall offer bulls on Your altar.

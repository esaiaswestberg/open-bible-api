Praise Jehovah! Praise the name of Jehovah; sing praise, servants of Jehovah;
those who stand in the house of Jehovah in the courts of the house of our God;
praise Jehovah! For Jehovah is good! Sing praises to His name, for it is delightful.
For Jehovah has chosen Jacob to Himself, Israel for His special treasure.
For I know that Jehovah is great, and our Lord is above all gods.
Every thing which Jehovah was pleased to do, He did, in the heavens and in the earth; and in the seas and all deep places.
He causes the vapors to rise from the end of the earth; He makes lightnings for the rain; He brings the wind out of His storehouses;
He who struck the first-born of Egypt, from man to animal;
who sent signs and wonders into your midst, O Egypt, on Pharaoh and on all his servants;
who struck great nations, and killed mighty kings;
Sihon king Of the Amorites, and Og king of Bashan, and all the kingdoms of Canaan.
And He gave their land as an inheritance, an inheritance to His people Israel.
O Jehovah, Your name endures forever; O Jehovah, Your memorial is from generation and generation.
For Jehovah will judge His people; and He will have pity on His servants.
The idols of the nations are silver and gold, the work of men's hands;
they have mouths, but they say nothing; they have eyes, but they see nothing;
they have ears, but they hear nothing; yea, there is no breath in their mouths.
Those who make them are like them, everyone who is trusting in them.
Bless Jehovah, O house of Israel; bless Jehovah, O house of Aaron;
Bless Jehovah, O house of Levi; you who fear Jehovah, bless Jehovah.
Blessed be Jehovah out of Zion, He who dwells at Jerusalem. Praise Jehovah!

To the Chief Musician. A Psalm of David. Blessed is he who acts wisely toward the poor; Jehovah will deliver him in the day of evil.
Jehovah will watch over him and keep him alive; he shall be blessed on the earth, and You will not deliver him to the soul of his enemies.
Jehovah will uphold him on the couch of sickness; You change all his bed in his sickness.
I said, O Jehovah be gracious to me; heal my soul, for I have sinned against You.
My enemies speak evil of me, saying , When will he die and his name perish.
And when he comes to see me he speaks vanity; his heart gathers iniquity to itself; he goes outside and speaks.
All my haters whisper together against me; they plot evil against me,
saying , A thing of ruin is poured out on him; and, He who lies down shall not rise again.
Even a man desiring my welfare, I trusted in him, eating of my bread; this one has lifted up his heel against me.
But You, O Jehovah, be gracious to me and raise me up, and I will repay them.
By this I know that You delight in me, because my enemy does not exult over me.
And I, in my integrity You uphold me, and You set your face before me forever.
Blessed be Jehovah God of Israel, even from everlasting to everlasting! Amen and Amen!

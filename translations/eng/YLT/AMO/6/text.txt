Pass ye over <FI>to<Fi> Calneh and see, And go thence <FI>to<Fi> Hamath the great, And go down <FI>to<Fi> Gath of the Philistines, Are <FI>they<Fi> better than these kingdoms? Greater <FI>is<Fi> their border than your border?
Who are putting away the day of evil, And ye bring nigh the seat of violence,
Who are lying down on beds of ivory, And are spread out on their couches, And are eating lambs from the flock, And calves from the midst of the stall,

Who are drinking with bowls of wine, And <FI>with<Fi> chief perfumes anoint <FI>themselves<Fi> , And have not been pained for the breach of Joseph.

For lo, Jehovah is commanding, And He hath smitten the great house <FI>with<Fi> breaches, And the little house <FI>with<Fi> clefts.
Do horses run on a rock? Doth one plough <FI>it<Fi> with oxen? For ye have turned to gall judgment, And the fruit of righteousness to wormwood.
O ye who are rejoicing at nothing, Who are saying, `Have we not by our strength taken to ourselves horns?'
Surely, lo, I am raising against you a nation, O house of Israel, An affirmation of Jehovah, God of Hosts, And they have oppressed you from the coming in to Hamath, Unto the stream of the desert.

Praise ye Jah! For <FI>it is<Fi> good to praise our God, For pleasant--comely <FI>is<Fi> praise.
Building Jerusalem <FI>is<Fi> Jehovah, The driven away of Israel He gathereth.
Who is giving healing to the broken of heart, And is binding up their griefs.
Appointing the number of the stars, To all them He giveth names.
Great <FI>is<Fi> our Lord, and abundant in power, Of His understanding there is no narration.
Jehovah is causing the meek to stand, Making low the wicked unto the earth.
Answer ye to Jehovah with thanksgiving, Sing ye to our God with a harp.
Who is covering the heavens with clouds, Who is preparing for the earth rain, Who is causing grass to spring up <FI>on<Fi> mountains,
Giving to the beast its food, To the young of the ravens that call.
Not in the might of the horse doth He delight, Not in the legs of a man is He pleased.
Jehovah is pleased with those fearing Him, With those waiting for His kindness.
Glorify, O Jerusalem, Jehovah, Praise thy God, O Zion.
For He did strengthen the bars of thy gates, He hath blessed thy sons in thy midst.
Who is making thy border peace, <FI>With<Fi> the fat of wheat He satisfieth Thee.
Who is sending forth His saying <FI>on<Fi> earth, Very speedily doth His word run.
Who is giving snow like wool, Hoar-frost as ashes He scattereth.
Casting forth His ice like morsels, Before His cold who doth stand?
He sendeth forth His word and melteth them, He causeth His wind to blow--the waters flow.
Declaring His words to Jacob, His statutes and His judgments to Israel.
He hath not done so to any nation, As to judgments, they have not known them. Praise ye Jah!

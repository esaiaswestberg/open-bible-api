A Song of the Ascents. In Jehovah's turning back <FI>to<Fi> the captivity of Zion, We have been as dreamers.
Then filled <FI>with<Fi> laughter is our mouth, And our tongue <FI>with<Fi> singing, Then do they say among nations, `Jehovah did great things with these.'
Jehovah did great things with us, We have been joyful.
Turn again, O Jehovah, <FI>to<Fi> our captivity, As streams in the south.
Those sowing in tears, with singing do reap,
Whoso goeth on and weepeth, Bearing the basket of seed, Surely cometh in with singing, bearing his sheaves!

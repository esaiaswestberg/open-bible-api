To the Overseer. --By David. In Jehovah I trusted, how say ye to my soul, `They moved <FI>to<Fi> Thy mountain for the bird?
For lo, the wicked tread a bow, They have prepared their arrow on the string, To shoot in darkness at the upright in heart.
When the foundations are destroyed, The righteous--what hath he done?
`Jehovah <FI>is<Fi> in his holy temple: Jehovah--in the heavens <FI>is<Fi> His throne. His eyes see--His eyelids try the sons of men.
Jehovah the righteous doth try. And the wicked and the lover of violence, Hath His soul hated,
He poureth on the wicked snares, fire, and brimstone, And a horrible wind <FI>is<Fi> the portion of their cup.
For righteous <FI>is<Fi> Jehovah, Righteousness He hath loved, The upright doth His countenance see!'

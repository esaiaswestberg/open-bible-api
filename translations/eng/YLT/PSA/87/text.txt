By sons of Korah. --A Psalm, a song. His foundation <FI>is<Fi> in holy mountains.
Jehovah is loving the gates of Zion Above all the tabernacles of Jacob.
Honourable things are spoken in Thee, O city of God. Selah.
I mention Rahab and Babel to those knowing Me, Lo, Philistia, and Tyre, with Cush! This <FI>one<Fi> was born there.
And of Zion it is said: Each one was born in her, And He, the Most High, doth establish her.
Jehovah doth recount in the describing of the peoples, `This <FI>one<Fi> was born there.' Selah.
Singers also as players on instruments, All my fountains <FI>are<Fi> in Thee!

And in that day you shall say, O LORD, I will praise you: though you were angry with me, your anger is turned away, and you comforted me.
Behold, God is my salvation; I will trust, and not be afraid: for the LORD JEHOVAH is my strength and my song; he also is become my salvation.
Therefore with joy shall all of you draw water out of the wells of salvation.
And in that day shall all of you say, Praise the LORD, call upon his name, declare his doings among the people, make mention that his name is exalted.
Sing unto the LORD; for he has done excellent things: this is known in all the earth.
Cry out and shout, you inhabitant of Zion: for great is the Holy One of Israel in the midst of you.

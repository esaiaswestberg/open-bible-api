Why stand you far off, O LORD? why hide you yourself in times of trouble?
The wicked in his pride does persecute the poor: let them be taken in the devices that they have imagined.
For the wicked boasts of his heart's desire, and blesses the covetous, whom the LORD detests.
The wicked, through the pride of his countenance, will not seek after God: God is not in all his thoughts.
His ways are always grievous; your judgments are far above out of his sight: as for all his enemies, he puffs at them.
He has said in his heart, I shall not be moved: for I shall never be in adversity.
His mouth is full of cursing and deceit and fraud: under his tongue is mischief and vanity.
He sits in the lurking places of the villages: in the secret places does he murder the innocent: his eyes are privately set against the poor.
He lies in wait secretly as a lion in his den: he lies in wait to catch the poor: he does catch the poor, when he draws him into his net.
He crouches, and humbles himself, that the poor may fall by his strong ones.
He has said in his heart, God has forgotten: he hides his face; he will never see it.
Arise, O LORD; O God, lift up your hand: forget not the humble.
Wherefore does the wicked contemn God? he has said in his heart, You will not require it.
You have seen it; for you behold mischief and spite, to requite it with your hand: the poor commits himself unto you; you are the helper of the fatherless.
Break you the arm of the wicked and the evil man: seek out his wickedness till you find none.
The LORD is King for ever and ever: the heathen are perished out of his land.
LORD, you have heard the desire of the humble: you will prepare their heart, you will cause your ear to hear:
To judge the fatherless and the oppressed, that the man of the earth may no more oppress.

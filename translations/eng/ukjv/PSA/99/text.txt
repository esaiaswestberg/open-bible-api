The LORD reigns; let the people tremble: he sits between the cherubims; let the earth be moved.
The LORD is great in Zion; and he is high above all the people.
Let them praise your great and terrible name; for it is holy.
The king's strength also loves judgment; you do establish equity, you execute judgment and righteousness in Jacob.
Exalt all of you the LORD our God, and worship at his footstool; for he is holy.
Moses and Aaron among his priests, and Samuel among them that call upon his name; they called upon the LORD, and he answered them.
He spoke unto them in the cloudy pillar: they kept his testimonies, and the ordinance that he gave them.
You answered them, O LORD our God: you were a God that forgave them, though you took vengeance of their inventions.
Exalt the LORD our God, and worship at his holy hill; for the LORD our God is holy.

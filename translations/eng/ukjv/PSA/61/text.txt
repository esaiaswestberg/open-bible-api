Hear my cry, O God; attend unto my prayer.
From the end of the earth will I cry unto you, when my heart is overwhelmed: lead me to the rock that is higher than I.
For you have been a shelter for me, and a strong tower from the enemy.
I will abide in your tabernacle for ever: I will trust in the covert of your wings. Selah.
For you, O God, have heard my vows: you have given me the heritage of those that fear your name.
You will prolong the king's life: and his years as many generations.
He shall abide before God for ever: O prepare mercy and truth, which may preserve him.
So will I sing praise unto your name for ever, that I may daily perform my vows.

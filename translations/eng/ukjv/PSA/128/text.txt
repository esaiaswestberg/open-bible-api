Blessed is every one that fears the LORD; that walks in his ways.
For you shall eat the labour of your hands: happy shall you be, and it shall be well with you.
Your wife shall be as a fruitful vine by the sides of your house: your children like olive plants round about your table.
Behold, that thus shall the man be blessed that fears the LORD.
The LORD shall bless you out of Zion: and you shall see the good of Jerusalem all the days of your life.
Yea, you shall see your children's children, and peace upon Israel.

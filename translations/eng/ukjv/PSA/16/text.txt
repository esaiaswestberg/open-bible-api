Preserve me, O God: for in you do I put my trust.
O my soul, you have said unto the LORD, You are my Lord: my goodness extends not to you;
But to the saints that are in the earth, and to the excellent, in whom is all my delight.
Their sorrows shall be multiplied that hasten after another god: their drink offerings of blood will I not offer, nor take up their names into my lips.
The LORD is the portion of mine inheritance and of my cup: you maintain my lot.
The lines are fallen unto me in pleasant places; yea, I have a goodly heritage.
I will bless the LORD, who has given me counsel: my reins also instruct me in the night seasons.
I have set the LORD always before me: because he is at my right hand, I shall not be moved.
Therefore my heart is glad, and my glory rejoices: my flesh also shall rest in hope.
For you will not leave my soul in hell; neither will you suffer your Holy One to see corruption.
You will show me the path of life: in your presence is fullness of joy; at your right hand there are pleasures for evermore.

Praise all of you the LORD. Praise all of you the LORD from the heavens: praise him in the heights.
Praise all of you him, all his angels: praise all of you him, all his hosts.
Praise all of you him, sun and moon: praise him, all you stars of light.
Praise him, all of you heavens of heavens, and all of you waters that be above the heavens.
Let them praise the name of the LORD: for he commanded, and they were created.
He has also established them for ever and ever: he has made a decree which shall not pass.
Praise the LORD from the earth, all of you dragons, and all deeps:
Fire, and hail; snow, and vapours; stormy wind fulfilling his word:
Mountains, and all hills; fruitful trees, and all cedars:
Beasts, and all cattle; creeping things, and flying fowl:
Kings of the earth, and all people; princes, and all judges of the earth:
Both young men, and maidens; old men, and children:
Let them praise the name of the LORD: for his name alone is excellent; his glory is above the earth and heaven.
He also exalts the horn of his people, the praise of all his saints; even of the children of Israel, a people near unto him. Praise all of you the LORD.

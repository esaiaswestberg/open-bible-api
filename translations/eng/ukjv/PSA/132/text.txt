Lord, remember David, and all his afflictions:
How he swore unto the LORD, and vowed unto the mighty God of Jacob;
Surely I will not come into the tabernacle of my house, nor go up into my bed;
I will not give sleep to mine eyes, or slumber to mine eyelids,
Until I find out a place for the LORD, an habitation for the mighty God of Jacob.
Lo, we heard of it at Ephratah: we found it in the fields of the wood.
We will go into his tabernacles: we will worship at his footstool.
Arise, O LORD, into your rest; you, and the ark of your strength.
Let your priests be clothed with righteousness; and let your saints shout for joy.
For your servant David's sake turn not away the face of your anointed.
The LORD has sworn in truth unto David; he will not turn from it; Of the fruit of your body will I set upon your throne.
If your children will keep my covenant and my testimony that I shall teach them, their children shall also sit upon your throne for evermore.
For the LORD has chosen Zion; he has desired it for his habitation.
This is my rest for ever: here will I dwell; for I have desired it.
I will abundantly bless her provision: I will satisfy her poor with bread.
I will also clothe her priests with salvation: and her saints shall shout aloud for joy.
There will I make the horn of David to bud: I have ordained a lamp for mine anointed.
His enemies will I clothe with shame: but upon himself shall his crown flourish.

I will praise you with my whole heart: before the gods will I sing praise unto you.
I will worship toward your holy temple, and praise your name for your loving kindness and for your truth: for you have magnified your word above all your name.
In the day when I cried you answered me, and strengthened me with strength in my soul.
All the kings of the earth shall praise you, O LORD, when they hear the words of your mouth.
Yea, they shall sing in the ways of the LORD: for great is the glory of the LORD.
Though the LORD be high, yet has he respect unto the lowly: but the proud he knows far off.
Though I walk in the midst of trouble, you will revive me: you shall stretch forth your hand against the wrath of mine enemies, and your right hand shall save me.
The LORD will perfect that which concerns me: your mercy, O LORD, endures for ever: forsake not the works of your own hands.

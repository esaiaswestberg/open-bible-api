When Israel went out of Egypt, the house of Jacob from a people of strange language;
Judah was his sanctuary, and Israel his dominion.
The sea saw it, and fled: Jordan was driven back.
The mountains skipped like rams, and the little hills like lambs.
What ailed you, O you sea, that you fled? you Jordan, that you were driven back?
All of you mountains, that all of you skipped like rams; and all of you little hills, like lambs?
Tremble, you earth, at the presence of the Lord, at the presence of the God of Jacob;
Which turned the rock into a standing water, the flint into a fountain of waters.

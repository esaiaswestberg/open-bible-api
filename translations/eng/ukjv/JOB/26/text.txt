But Job answered and said,
How have you helped him that is without power? how save you the arm that has no strength?
How have you counselled him that has no wisdom? and how have you plentifully declared the thing as it is?
To whom have you uttered words? and whose spirit came from you?
Dead things are formed from under the waters, and the inhabitants thereof.
Hell is naked before him, and destruction has no covering.
He stretches out the north over the empty place, and hangs the earth upon nothing.
He binds up the waters in his thick clouds; and the cloud is not rent under them.
He holds back the face of his throne, and spreads his cloud upon it.
He has compassed the waters with bounds, until the day and night come to an end.
The pillars of heaven tremble and are astonished at his reproof.
He divides the sea with his power, and by his understanding he strikes through the proud.
By his spirit he has garnished the heavens; his hand has formed the crooked serpent.
Lo, these are parts of his ways: but how little a portion is heard of him? but the thunder of his power who can understand?

Now the Spirit (o. pneuma) speaks expressly, that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, (o. pneuma) and doctrines of devils;
Speaking lies in hypocrisy; having their conscience seared with a hot iron;
Forbidding to marry, and commanding to abstain from meats, which God has created to be received with thanksgiving of them which believe and know the truth.
For every creature of God is good, and nothing to be refused, if it be received with thanksgiving:
For it is sanctified by the word (o. logos) of God and prayer.
If you put the brethren in remembrance of these things, you shall be a good minister of Jesus Christ, nourished up in the words (o. logos) of faith and of good doctrine, unto which you have attained.
But refuse profane and old wives' fables, and exercise yourself rather unto godliness.
For bodily exercise profits little: but godliness is profitable unto all things, having promise of the life that now is, and of that which is to come.
This is a faithful saying (o. logos) and worthy of all acceptation.

Till I come, give attendance to reading, to exhortation, to doctrine.
Neglect not the gift that is in you, which was given you by prophecy, with the laying on of the hands of the presbytery.
Meditate upon these things; give yourself wholly to them; that your profiting may appear to all.
Take heed unto yourself, and unto the doctrine; continue in them: for in doing this you shall both save yourself, and them that hear you.

And Balak did as Balaam had spoken; and Balak and Balaam offered on every altar a bullock and a ram.

And Balak said unto Balaam, What have you done unto me? I took you to curse mine enemies, and, behold, you have blessed them altogether.
And he answered and said, Must I not take heed to speak that which the LORD has put in my mouth?

But Balaam answered and said unto Balak, Told not I you, saying, All that the LORD speaks, that I must do?

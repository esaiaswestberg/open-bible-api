And the LORD spoke unto Moses, saying,
Command the children of Israel, and say unto them, My offering, and my bread for my sacrifices made by fire, for a sweet savour unto me, shall all of you observe to offer unto me in their due season.
And you shall say unto them, This is the offering made by fire which all of you shall offer unto the LORD; two lambs of the first year without spot day by day, for a continual burnt offering.
The one lamb shall you offer in the morning, and the other lamb shall you offer at even;
And a tenth part of an ephah of flour for a food offering, mingled with the fourth part of an hin of beaten oil.
It is a continual burnt offering, which was ordained in mount Sinai for a sweet savour, a sacrifice made by fire unto the LORD.
And the drink offering thereof shall be the fourth part of an hin for the one lamb: in the holy place shall you cause the strong wine to be poured unto the LORD for a drink offering.
And the other lamb shall you offer at even: as the food offering of the morning, and as the drink offering thereof, you shall offer it, a sacrifice made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD.
And on the sabbath day two lambs of the first year without spot, and two tenth deals of flour for a food offering, mingled with oil, and the drink offering thereof:
This is the burnt offering of every sabbath, beside the continual burnt offering, and his drink offering.
And in the beginnings of your months all of you shall offer a burnt offering unto the LORD; two young bullocks, and one ram, seven lambs of the first year without spot;
And three tenth deals of flour for a food offering, mingled with oil, for one bullock; and two tenth deals of flour for a food offering, mingled with oil, for one ram;
And a several tenth deal of flour mingled with oil for a food offering unto one lamb; for a burnt offering of a sweet savour, a sacrifice made by fire unto the LORD.
And their drink offerings shall be half an hin of wine unto a bullock, and the third part of an hin unto a ram, and a fourth part of an hin unto a lamb: this is the burnt offering of every month throughout the months of the year.
And one kid of the goats for a sin offering unto the LORD shall be offered, beside the continual burnt offering, and his drink offering.
And in the fourteenth day of the first month is the passover of the LORD.
And in the fifteenth day of this month is the feast: seven days shall unleavened bread be eaten.
In the first day shall be an holy convocation; all of you shall do no manner of servile work therein:
But all of you shall offer a sacrifice made by fire for a burnt offering unto the LORD; two young bullocks, and one ram, and seven lambs of the first year: they shall be unto you without blemish:
And their food offering shall be of flour mingled with oil: three tenth deals shall all of you offer for a bullock, and two tenth deals for a ram;
A several tenth deal shall you offer for every lamb, throughout the seven lambs:
And one goat for a sin offering, to make an atonement for you.
All of you shall offer these beside the burnt offering in the morning, which is for a continual burnt offering.
After this manner all of you shall offer daily, throughout the seven days, the food of the sacrifice made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD: it shall be offered beside the continual burnt offering, and his drink offering.
And on the seventh day all of you shall have an holy convocation; all of you shall do no servile work.
Also in the day of the first-fruits, when all of you bring a new food offering unto the LORD, after your weeks be out, all of you shall have an holy convocation; all of you shall do no servile work:
But all of you shall offer the burnt offering for a sweet savour unto the LORD; two young bullocks, one ram, seven lambs of the first year;
And their food offering of flour mingled with oil, three tenth deals unto one bullock, two tenth deals unto one ram,
A several tenth deal unto one lamb, throughout the seven lambs;
And one kid of the goats, to make an atonement for you.
All of you shall offer them beside the continual burnt offering, and his food offering, (they shall be unto you without blemish) and their drink offerings.

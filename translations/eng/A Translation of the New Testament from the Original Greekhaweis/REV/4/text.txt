AFTER these things I beheld, and, lo! a door was opened in heaven, and a voice, the first which I heard, as of a trumpet, speaking to me, said, Come up hither, and I will shew thee what things will be after these.
And immediately I was rapt in spirit: and, lo! a throne was placed in heaven, and upon the throne a person sitting.
And he that sat was in appearance like a stone of jasper and sardine: and a rainbow encircled the throne, like in hue to an emerald.
And around the throne were twenty-four thrones; and upon these thrones I saw twenty-four presbyters seated, clothed in white robes; and they had on their heads golden crowns.
And out of the throne issued forth lightnings, and thunder, and loud voices; and seven lamps of fire burned before the throne, which are the seven spirits of God.
And before the throne was a sea of glass like crystal: and in the midst of the throne, and within the circle of the throne, were four living beings full of eyes before and behind.
And the first living being was like a lion, and the second living being was like a calf, and the third living being had a face as a man, and the fourth living being was like an eagle with wings expanded.
And the four living beings had each for himself six wings encircling him, and within they were full of eyes; and they never cease day and night, saying, Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty, who was, and who is, and who is coming.
And when these living beings give glory, and honour, and thanksgiving to him that sitteth on the throne, to him who liveth for ever and ever,
the four and twenty presbyters prostrate themselves before him who is Seated on the throne, and worship him who liveth for ever and ever, and cast their crowns before the throne, saying,
Worthy art thou, O Lord, to receive glory, and honour, and power; for thou hast created all things, and by thy will they exist, and were created.

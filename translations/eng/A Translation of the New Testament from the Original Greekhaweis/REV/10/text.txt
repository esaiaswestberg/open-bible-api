AND I saw another mighty angel descending from heaven, clothed with a cloud; and a rainbow on his head, and his countenance as the sun, and his feet as pillars of fire:
and he held in his hand a little book open; and he placed his right foot on the sea, and his left on the land,
and cried with a loud voice, as a lion roareth: and when he had cried, the seven thunders uttered their voices.
And when the seven thunders had uttered their voices, I was about to write: and I heard a voice from heaven saying to me, Seal up the things, which the seven thunders have spoken, and write them not down.
And the angel which I saw standing upon the sea and upon the land lifted up his hand towards heaven,
and he swore by him that liveth for ever and ever, who created the heaven and the things which are therein, and the earth and the things which are in it, and the sea, and the things which are therein, that time shall be no longer:
but that in the days of the blast of the seventh angel, when he shall sound, then shall the mystery of God be completed, as he spake by his own servants the prophets.
And the voice which I heard out of heaven again spoke to me, and said, Go take the little book which is open in the hand of the angel that standeth upon the sea and upon the land.
And I went up to the angel, saying unto him, Give me that little book. And he saith to me, Take it, and eat it up; and it will make thy belly bitter, though in thy mouth it will be sweet as honey.
And I took the little book out of the angel’s hand, and ate it up; and it was in my mouth as honey sweet; yet when I had eaten it, my belly was made bitter.
And he said to me, Thou must prophesy again before many people, and nations, and tongues, and monarchs.

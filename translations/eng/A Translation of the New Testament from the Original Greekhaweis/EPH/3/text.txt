FOR this cause am I Paul, the prisoner of Jesus Christ for you Gentiles,
if so be, that ye have heard of the dispensation of the grace of God which was given to me for you:
that by revelation he made known unto me the mystery, as I wrote unto you before briefly;
wherein when ye read, ye may be able to perceive my knowledge in the mystery of Christ,
which in other generations was not made known to the children of men, as it hath been now revealed to his holy apostles and prophets by the Spirit;
that the Gentiles should be co-heirs, and of the same body, and sharers with them of his promise in Christ by the Gospel:
of which I am made a minister, according to the gift of the grace of God, which was given unto me by the effectual working of his power.
To me, who am less than the least of all saints, is this grace given, that I should preach among the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ;
and to make all men see what the communication of that mystery means, which was hid from the beginning in God, who created all things by Jesus Christ:
that now to the principalities and powers in the heavenly regions, the manifold wisdom of God might be made known by the church,
according to the purpose from everlasting, which he formed in Christ Jesus our Lord:
in whom we have boldness and access with confidence to God by the faith of him.
Wherefore 1 beseech you, that ye faint not at my tribulations for you, which is your glory.
For this end I bow my knees to the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,
of whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named;
that he would give you according to the riches of his glory, to be strengthened with might by his spirit in the inner man;
that Christ may dwell by faith in your hearts; that rooted and grounded in love,
ye may be strengthened to comprehend with all saints, what is the breadth and length, and height and depth;
and to know the love of Christ, transcendently surpassing knowledge, that ye may be filled with all the fulness of God.
Now to him that is able to do above all things, exceeding abundantly, beyond what we ask or think, according to the power which effectually worketh in us;
to him be glory in the church, in Christ Jesus, unto all generations for ever and ever. Amen.

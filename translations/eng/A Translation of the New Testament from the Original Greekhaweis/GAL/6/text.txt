BRETHREN, if a man also be surprised into any act of offence, ye that are spiritual, replace such a one in the spirit of meekness; keeping an attentive eye on thyself, lest thou also be tempted.
Bear ye one another’s burdens, and so fulfil the law of Christ.
For if any man conceits that he is something when he is nothing, he deceiveth himself.
But let every man bring his own work to the test, and then shall he have glorying in himself alone, and not by comparison with another.
For every man shall bear his own burden.
Let him who is a learner of the word communicate to his instructor in all good things.
Be not deceived; God is not to be trifled with: for whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap.
For he that soweth unto his flesh, shall of the flesh reap corruption, and he that soweth to the Spirit, shall of the Spirit reap life everlasting.
Let us not then be weary of well-doing; for in due time we shall reap, if we faint not.
Well then, whilst we have opportunity, let us do good unto all men, but especially unto those who are of the household of faith.
Ye see in how many words I have written unto you with my own hand.
As many as wish to make a fair appearance in the flesh, they compel you to be circumcised, only that they may not suffer persecution for the cross of Christ.
For even they who are themselves circumcised do not keep the law, but desire you to be circumcised, that they may glory in your flesh.
But God forbid that I should glory, save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom the world is crucified unto me, and I unto the world,
For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor uncircumcision, but a new creation.
And as many as shall walk after this rule, peace be upon them, and mercy, and upon the Israel of God.
Henceforth let no man trouble me; for I bear the marks of our Lord Jesus Christ in my body.
The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit, brethren. Amen.   To the Galatians, written from Rome. \p

BUT speak thou the things which become sound doctrine:
that the elder men be sober, grave, discreet, sound in faith, in love, in patience.
That the elder women also be sacredly becoming in their behaviour, not slanderers, not enslaved by much wine, teachers of propriety;
that they instruct the young women to be discreet, to love their husbands, to love their children,
to be sober, domestic, good, obedient to their own husbands, that the word of God be not ill reported of.
The younger men in like manner exhort to be sober minded.
In all things approving thyself as a pattern of good works: in thy teaching, shewing integrity, gravity, incorruptibility,
sound discourse, incapable of confutation; that he who is in opposition may be confounded, having nothing faulty to say of you.
Let servants be subject to their own masters, in all things to be agreeable to them; not contradicting;
not embezzling their property, but demonstrating all good fidelity; that they may adorn the doctrine of God our Saviour in all things.
For the grace of God which leads to salvation hath appeared unto all men,
instructing us, that denying ungodliness and worldly affections, we should live soberly and righteously, and godly in the present day;
expecting the blessed hope, and glorious appearing of our great God and Saviour Jesus Christ;
who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify to himself a peculiar people, zealous of good works.
These things speak and enjoin, and reprove with all authority. Let no man despise thee.

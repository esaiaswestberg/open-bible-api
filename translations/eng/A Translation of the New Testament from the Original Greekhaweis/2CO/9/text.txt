NOW concerning the contribution for the saints, it is superfluous for me to write unto you.
For I know your readiness of mind, for which I boast of you to the Macedonians, that Achaia had made preparation a year ago; and your zeal hath stirred up very many.
But I have sent the brethren, that our glorying in you might not be vain in this matter; that as I have said, ye may be prepared.
Lest haply if the Macedonians come with me, and find you unprepared, we (not to say, you) may be confounded in this confidence of boasting. I
have thought it necessary therefore to exhort the brethren, that they would go before unto you, and prepare before your promised bounty, that it may be ready as a matter of bounty, and not as extorted of covetousness.
But this I add, He that soweth sparingly, shall reap also sparingly, and he that soweth bountifully, shall reap also bountifully.
Let every man, as he hath purposed in heart, give, not with reluctance or of necessity; for God loveth a cheerful giver.
And God is able to make all grace abound towards you; that in every case having always all sufficiency, ye may abound unto every good work:
as it is written, “He hath scattered abroad, he hath given to the poor, his righteousness abideth for ever.”
Now he that supplieth seed to the sower, shall also supply bread for food, and multiply your seed sown, and increase the fruits of your righteousness,
being in every thing enriched unto all liberality, which causeth by us thanksgiving to God.
For the ministration of this charitable service not only abundantly supplies the deficiencies of the saints, but also overflows with many thanksgivings to God;
(while by the evidence of this ministration they glorify God for your professed subjection to the gospel of Christ, and for your liberality towards them, and towards all men;)
and with their prayers for you, greatly longing after you, on account of the transcendent grace of God in you.
Thanks be to God for his inexpressible gift.

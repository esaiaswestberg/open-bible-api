WE then as labourers with him, exhort you also that ye receive not the grace of God in vain:
for he saith, “In an acceptable time have I heard thee, and in a day of salvation have I succoured thee.” Behold, now is the accepted time; behold, now is the day of salvation.
Giving no offence in any thing, that the ministry be not blamed:
but in every thing approving ourselves as ministers of God, in much patience, in afflictions, in necessities, in straits,
in stripes, in imprisonments, in tumults, in labours, in watchings, in fastings,
in purity, in knowledge, in long-suffering, by kindness, by the Holy Ghost, by love unfeigned,
by the word of truth, by the power of God, with weapons of righteousness in the right hand and in the left,
through honour and dishonour, through evil report and good report: as deceivers, yet true men;
as unknown, though well known; as dying, and lo! we live; as chastened, yet not given over to death;
as sorrowful, yet always rejoicing; as poor, yet making many rich; as having nothing, and yet possessing all things.
Our mouth is opened unto you, O Corinthians! our heart is enlarged.
Ye are not straitened in us, but ye are straitened in your own bowels.
Let us have a like return; I speak as unto children; be ye also enlarged.
Be not unequally yoked with infidels; for what participation hath righteousness with unrighteousness? and what fellowship is there between light and darkness?
and what concord of Christ with Belial? or what share hath he that believeth with an infidel?
or what agreement hath the temple of God with idols? for ye are the temple of the living God; as God hath said, “I will inhabit in them, and walk about in them; and I will be their God, and they shall be for me a people.”
“Wherefore go forth from the midst of them, and be ye separated, saith the Lord, and touch not the unclean; and I will receive you,
and I will be as a father unto you, and ye shall be to me for sons and daughters, saith the Lord Almighty.”

NOW concerning the things sacrificed to idols, we know that we all have knowledge. Knowledge puffeth up, but love edifieth.
But if any man conceit that he knoweth any thing, he knoweth nothing yet as he ought to know.
But if any man love God, the same is known of him.
Now concerning eating things sacrificed unto idols: we know that an idol is nothing in the world, and that there is no other God but one.
For though there are gods so called, whether celestial or terrestrial, (as of this sort there are gods many, and lords many;)
but to us there is one God, the Father; of whom are all things, and we for him; and one Lord Jesus Christ, by whom are all things, and we by him.
Howbeit there is not in all men this knowledge; but some having conscientious respect for the idol to this moment, eat the meat as sacrificed to the idol; and their conscience being weak, is defiled.
But meat commendeth us not to God: for neither if we eat are we the better, or if we eat not are we the worse.
But take heed that this power of yours become not an occasion of stumbling to the weak.
For if any man see thee that hast knowledge, sitting in an idol’s temple, shall not the conscience of him who is weak be emboldened to eat what is sacrificed to idols?
And the weak brother will be destroyed by thy knowledge, for whom Christ died.
But when ye sin so against the brethren, and wound their weak conscience, ye sin against Christ.
Wherefore if meat give occasion of offence to my brother, I will in no wise eat meat for ever, that I give no cause of offence to my brother.

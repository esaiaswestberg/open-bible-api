THOUGH I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, but have not love, I am become as sounding brass, and tinkling cymbal.
And though I have the gift of prophecy, and know all mysteries, and all manner of science; and though I have all faith, so that I could remove mountains, but have not love, I am nothing.
And if I deal out all my goods in alms, and deliver up my body that I should be burned, but have not love, I am nothing advantaged by it.
Love is long-suffering, is kind; love envieth not; love is no vain boaster, is not inflated with pride,
doth not act unseemly, seeketh not her own advantage, is not passionate, thinketh no evil;
rejoiceth not in unrighteousness, but rejoiceth in the truth;
beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things.
Love never faileth: but if there be prophetic gifts, they shall be no more; if tongues, they shall cease; if science, it shall vanish away.
For we know partially, and prophesy partially.
But when that which is perfect cometh, then that which is in part shall be done away.
When I was a child, I spake as a child, I thought as a child, I reasoned as a child: but when I grew a man, I put away childish things.
For now we see by reflected light, indistinctly; but then face to face: now I know partially; but then shall I know even as I am known.
But now abideth faith, hope, love, these three; but the greater of these is love.

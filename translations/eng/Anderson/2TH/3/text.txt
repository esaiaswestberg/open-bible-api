Finally, brethren, pray for us, that the word of the Lord may run and be glorified even as among you;
and that we may be delivered from wicked and evil men; for all have not the disposition for faith.
But the Lord is faithful, and he will strengthen you, and keep you from the evil one.
And we have confidence in the Lord with respect to you, that you both do, and will continue to do, the things which we command you.
And the Lord direct your hearts to the love of God, and to the patience of the Christ.
Now we command you, brethren, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you withdraw from every brother that walks disorderly, and not according to the tradition which he received from us.
For you yourselves know how you ought to imitate us: for we did not behave in a disorderly manner among you,
nor did we eat any one’s bread for nothing: but worked with labor and toil, night and day, that we might not burden any one of you;
this we did, not because we have not authority, but that we might give ourselves to you as an example, in order that you might imitate us.
For when we were with you, we gave you this commandment, that if any one will not work, neither let him eat.
For we hear that some walk about among you in a disorderly manner, doing no work, but being busybodies.
Now we command such, and exhort them by our Lord Jesus Christ, that they work with quietness, and eat their own bread.
And you, brethren, should not be weary in well-doing.
And if any one obey not our word by this letter, note that man, and do not keep company with him, that he may be ashamed;
and yet do not regard him as an enemy, but admonish him as a brother.
Now the Lord of peace himself give you peace always by all means. The Lord be with you all.
The salutation of Paul with my own hand, which is the token in every letter: so I write.
The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.

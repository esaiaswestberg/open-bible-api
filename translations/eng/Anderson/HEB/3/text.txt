Wherefore, holy brethren, partakers of the heavenly calling, consider the apostle and high priest of our confession, Christ Jesus,
who is faithful to him that appointed him, as Moses also was faithful in all his house.
For this man is counted worthy of more glory than Moses, inasmuch as he who has builded the house, has more honor than the house.
For every house is builded by some one; but he that built all things is God.
And Moses indeed was faithful in all his house as a servant, to bear testimony to those things which were to be spoken afterward;
but Christ, as a Son over his own house; whose house we are, if we hold the confidence and the joy of our hope firm to the end.
Wherefore, as the Holy Spirit says: To-day, if you will hear his voice,
harden not your hearts, as in the bitter provocation, in the day of trial in the wilderness,
where your fathers tried me, proved me, and saw my works forty years.
Where fore, I was angry with that generation, and said, They do always err in their heart, and they have not known my ways:
so that I swore in my anger, They shall not enter into my rest.
Take heed, brethren, lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief in apostatizing from the living God.
But exhort one another daily, while it is called To-day, lest any of you be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin.
For we are partakers of the Christ, if we hold our begun confidence firm to the end;
while it is said, To-day, if you will hear his voice, harden not your hearts, as in the bitter provocation.
For some, when they had heard, did bitterly provoke; yet, not all that came out of Egypt by Moses.
But with whom was he angry forty years? Was it not with those who sinned, whose carcasses fell in the wilderness?
But to whom did he swear that they should not enter into his rest, but to those who believed not?
And so we see that they could not enter in because of unbelief.

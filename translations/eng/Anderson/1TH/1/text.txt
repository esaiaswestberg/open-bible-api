Paul and Sylvanus and Timothy to the church of the Thessalonians, which is in God the Father and in the Lord Jesus Christ: grace be to you, and peace from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ.
We give thanks to God always for you all, making mention of you in our prayers,
remembering unceasingly your work, which is the result of faith, your labor, the cause of which is love, and your patience, which springs from your hope in our Lord Jesus Christ, in the sight of our God and Father:
because we know, brethren beloved of God, your election.
For our gospel came not to you in word only, but also in power, and in the Holy Spirit, and in full assurance, as you know what sort of persons we were among you for your sakes.
And you became imitators of us and of the Lord, having received the word in much affliction with joy of the Holy Spirit,
so that you were examples to all that believe, in Macedonia and Achaia.
For from you, the word of the Lord sounded out, not only in Macedonia and Achaia, but also your faith in God has gone abroad in every place, so that we have no need to speak any thing.
For they themselves declare concerning us what kind of entrance we had to you, and how you turned to God from idols, to serve the living and true God,
and to wait for his Son from heaven, even Jesus, whom he raised from the dead, and who delivers us from the coming wrath.

Wherefore, being no longer able to contain ourselves, we thought it good to be left at Athens alone;
and we sent Timothy our brother and minister of God in the gospel of the Christ, in order that he might strengthen and comfort you with respect to your faith,
that no one be moved by these afflictions; for you yourselves know that we are appointed to this:
for even when we were with you, we told you beforehand that we were about to be afflicted, as it also came to pass, and as you know.
For this reason, when I could no longer contain myself, I sent to know your faith, lest by any means the tempter had tempted you, and our labor should be in vain.
But now, since Timothy has come to us from you, and has told us the good news of your faith and love, and that you have a good remembrance of us at all times, greatly desiring to see us, as indeed we desire to see you,
for this reason we are comforted concerning you, brethren, in all our distress and affliction, by your faith:
for now we live, if you stand firm in the Lord.
For what thanks can we render to God for you, for the great joy with which we rejoice on your account before our God,
night and day praying exceedingly that we may see your face, and perfect that which is lacking in your faith?
Now, may God himself, even our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ, direct our way to you.
And may the Lord cause you to increase and abound in love to one another and to all, even as we toward you,
in order that he may establish your hearts blameless in holiness, in the presence of our God and Father, at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ with all his saints.

The elders that are among you I exhort, who am a fellow-elder, and a witness of the sufferings of the Christ, and a sharer in the glory that is to be revealed.
Act as shepherds to the flock of God which is among you, taking the oversight, not by compulsion, but willingly; not for the sake of sordid gain, but from readiness of mind:
neither as being lords over God’s possessions, but being examples to the flock.
And when the chief shepherd shall appear, you shall receive the crown of glory that fades not away.
Likewise, you younger, be in subjection to the older: do you all indeed be subject one to another, and be clothed with humility: for God resists the proud, but gives grace to the lowly.
Humble yourselves, therefore, under the strong hand of God, that he may exalt you in due season.
Cast all your cares on him, for he cares for you.
Be sober, be watchful: for your adversary, the devil, like a roaring lion, walks about, seeking whom he may devour.
Being firm in the faith, resist him, knowing that the same afflictions are accomplished in your brethren who are in the world.
But may the God of all grace, who has called us to his eternal glory by Christ Jesus, after you have suffered a while, make you perfect, establish, strengthen, confirm you.
To him be glory and dominion from age to age. Amen.
By Sylvanus, a faithful brother to you, as I suppose, I have written briefly, exhorting, and testifying that this is the true grace of God in which you stand.
The church in Babylon, elected together with you, salutes you, and so does Marcus my son.
Salute one another with a kiss of love. Peace be with you all that are in Christ Jesus.

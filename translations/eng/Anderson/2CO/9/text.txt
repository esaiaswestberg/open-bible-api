For of the relief which is for the saints, it is needless for me to write to you.
For I know your readiness of mind, on account of which I boasted of you to the Macedonians, that Achaia was ready a year ago: and your zeal has incited very many.
But I have sent the brethren, that our boasting of you in this respect may not be in vain; that you may be ready, as I said:
lest, possibly, should the Macedonians come with me, and find you unprepared, we (not to say you) might be made ashamed by this same confident boasting.
Therefore, I thought it necessary to exhort the brethren to go before to you, and make ready beforehand your bounty, which has been so much talked of before, that this might be ready as a bounty, and not as a gift extorted from you.
But remember this, that he who sows sparingly, shall also reap sparingly; and he who sows bountifully, shall also reap bountifully.
Let each one give, as he purposes in his heart; not with grief, nor from necessity: for God loves a cheerful giver.
And God is able to confer every gift upon you abundantly, that you, always having all sufficiency in every thing, may have enough for every good work;
as it is written: He has scattered abroad; he has given to the poor; his righteousness remains forever.
Now, he that furnishes seed to the sower will both furnish bread for food, and multiply your seed sown, and increase the fruits of your righteousness;
that you may be enriched in every thing, for all liberality which produces through us thanksgiving to God;
because the administration of this service not only supplies the wants of the saints, but also abounds in many thanksgivings to God;
(since through the proof which this service gives, they glorify God for your acknowledged subjection to the gospel of Christ, and for the liberality of your contribution for them, and for all;)
and in their prayer for you, since they have strong affection for you on account of the eminent grace of God that is in you.
Thanks be to God for his unspeakable gift.

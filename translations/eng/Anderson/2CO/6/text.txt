As co-workers with him, we beseech you, that you receive not the grace of God in vain:
(for he says: I have heard thee in an acceptable time, and in the day of salvation I have helped thee. Behold, now is the acceptable time; behold, now is the day of salvation:)
for we put no stumbling-block in any man’s way, in order that this ministry may not be blamed;
but in all things we commend ourselves as the ministers of God, in much suffering, in afflictions, in distresses, in straits,
in stripes, in prisons,, in commotions, in labors, in watchings, in fastings;
by purity, by knowledge, by long forbearance, by kindness, by the Holy Spirit, by love unfeigned,
by the word of truth, by the power of God, by the armor of righteousness on the right hand and on the left,
by honor and dishonor, by evil report, and good report; as impostors, yet truthful;
as unknown, yet well-known; as dying, and behold, we live; as chastened, and yet not put to death;
as sorrowful, yet always rejoicing; as poor, yet making many rich; as having nothing, yet possessing all things.
Corinthians, our mouth is opened to you, our heart is enlarged:
you are not straitened in us, but you are straitened in your own affections.
That you may repay me in like manner, (I speak as to children,) be you also enlarged.
Be not unequally yoked together with unbelievers: for what fellowship has righteousness with lawlessness? What communion has light with darkness?
What agreement has Christ with Belial? What connection has a believer with an unbeliever?
What has a temple of God in common with one of idols? For you are the temple of the living God, as God has said: I will dwell in them, and walk among them; and I will be their God, and they shall be my people.
For this reason, come out from among them, and separate yourselves, says the Lord, and touch not an unclean person, and I will receive you;
and I will be to you a father, and you shall be to me sons and daughters, says the Lord Almighty.

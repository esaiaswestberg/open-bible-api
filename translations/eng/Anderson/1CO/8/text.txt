Now, with respect to meats offered to idols, we know, (for we all have knowledge: knowledge puffs up with pride, but love edifies.
If any one thinks that he knows any thing, he knows nothing yet, as he ought to know it:
but if any one loves God, he is taught by him).
With respect, then, to the eating of meats offered to idols, we know that an idol is nothing in the world, and that there is no other God but one.
For though there are those which are called gods, whether in heaven or on earth, (as there are many gods, and many lords,)
yet to us there is one God, the Father, from whom are all things, and we for him; and one Lord, Jesus Christ, by whom are all things, and we by him.
But all have not this knowledge; for some, under the persuasion that an idol is a reality, even yet eat meat, as if it were offered to an idol, and their conscience being weak, is defiled.
But meat commends us not to God; for, neither if we eat are we better, nor, if we eat not, are we worse.
But take heed, lest, by any means, this right of yours become a stumbling-block to those who are weak.
For, if any one see you, who have knowledge, reclining at table in an idol’s temple, will not the conscience of him who is weak be emboldened, so that he will eat meats offered to idols?
and will not the weak brother, for whom Christ died, perish through your knowledge?
But if you sin in this way against the brethren, and wound their weak conscience, you sin against Christ.
For which reason, if meat cause my brother to fall, I will never eat meat, lest I cause my brother to fall.

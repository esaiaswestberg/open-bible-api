Then Job answered and said:
Still is my complaint bitter; But my wound is deeper than my groaning.
O that I knew where I might find him! That I might go before his throne!
I would order my cause before him, And fill my mouth with arguments;
I should know what he would answer me, And understand what he would say to me.
Would he contend with me with his mighty power? No! he would have regard to me.
Then would an upright man contend with him, And I should be fully acquitted by my judge.
But, behold, I go eastward, and he is not there; And westward, but I cannot perceive him;
To the north, where he worketh, but I cannot behold him; He hideth himself on the south, and I cannot see him.
But he knoweth the way which is in my heart; When he trieth me, I shall come forth as gold.
My feet have trodden in his steps; His way I have kept, and have not turned aside from it.
I have not neglected the precepts of his lips; Above my own law have I esteemed the words of his mouth.
But he is of one mind, and who can turn him? And what he desireth, that he doeth.
He performeth that which is appointed for me; And many such things are in his mind!
Therefore I am in terror on account of him; When I consider, I am afraid of him.
For God maketh my heart faint; Yea, the Almighty terrifieth me;
Because I was not taken away before darkness came, And he hath not hidden darkness from mine eyes.

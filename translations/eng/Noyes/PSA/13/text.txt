How long, O LORD! wilt thou forget me for ever? How long wilt thou hide thy face from me?
How long shall I have anxiety in my soul for ever, And sorrow in my heart all the day? How long shall my enemy be exalted over me?
Look down and hear me, O LORD, my God! Enlighten my eyes, lest I sleep the sleep of death;
Lest my enemy say, "I have prevailed against him!" Lest my adversaries rejoice, when I am fallen.
Yet will I trust in thy goodness; My heart shall rejoice in thy salvation;
I will sing to the LORD, that he hath dealt kindly with me.

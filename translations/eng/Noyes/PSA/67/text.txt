O God! be merciful to us, and bless us, And cause thy face to shine upon us! [Pause.]
That thy doings may be known on earth, And thy saving power to all the nations.
Let the nations praise thee, O God! Yea, let all the nations praise thee!
Let all the nations be glad, and shout for joy! For justly dost thou judge the people, And govern the nations on the earth.
Let the nations praise thee, O God! Yea, let all the nations praise thee!
For the earth hath yielded her increase, And God, our God, hath blessed us.
May God continue to bless us, And may all the ends of the earth fear him!

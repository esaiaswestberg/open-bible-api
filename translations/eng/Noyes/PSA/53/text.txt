The fool saith in his heart, "There is no God!" They are corrupt; their doings are abominable; There is none that doeth good.
God looketh down from heaven upon the children of men, To see if there are any that have understanding, That have regard to God.
They are all gone astray; together are they corrupt; There is none that doeth good, no, not one.
Shall not the evil-doers be requited, Who eat up my people like bread, And call not upon God?
Yea! fear shall come upon them, Where no fear is; For God will scatter the bones of him that encampeth against thee; Thou shalt put them to shame, for God despiseth them!
O that salvation for Israel would come out of Zion! When God bringeth back the captives of his people, Jacob shall rejoice, and Israel be glad.

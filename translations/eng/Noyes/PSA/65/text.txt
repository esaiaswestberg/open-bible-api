To thee belongeth trust, to thee praise, O God in Zion! And to thee shall the vow be performed!
O Thou that hearest prayer! To thee shall all flesh come!
My iniquities are heavy upon me; But thou wilt forgive our transgressions!
Happy is he whom thou choosest, And bringest near thee to dwell in thy courts! May we be satisfied with the blessings of thy house, Thy holy temple!
By wonderful deeds dost thou answer us in thy goodness, O God, our salvation! Who art the confidence of all the ends of the earth, And of the most distant seas!
Thou makest fast the mountains by thy power, Being girded with strength!
Thou stillest the roar of the sea, The roar of its waves, And the tumult of the nations.
They who dwell in the ends of the earth are awed by thy signs; Thou makest the outgoings of the morning and of the evening to rejoice!
Thou visitest the earth and waterest it; Thou enrichest it exceedingly; The river of God is full of water. Thou suppliest the earth with corn, When thou hast thus prepared it.
Thou waterest its furrows, And breakest down its ridges; Thou makest it soft with showers, And blessest its increase.
Thou crownest the year with thy goodness; Thy footsteps drop fruitfulness;
They drop it upon the pastures of the wilderness, And the hills are girded with gladness.
The pastures are clothed with flocks, And the valleys are covered with corn; They shout, yea, they sing for joy.

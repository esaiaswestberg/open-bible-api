God standeth in God’s assembly, He judgeth in the midst of the gods.
"How long will ye judge unjustly, And favor the cause of the wicked? [Pause.]
Defend the poor and the fatherless; Do justice to the wretched and the needy!
Deliver the poor and the destitute; Save them from the hand of the wicked!
They are without knowledge and without understanding; They walk in darkness: Therefore all the foundations of the land are shaken.
I have said, Ye are gods, And all of you children of the Most High;
But ye shall die like men, And fall like the rest of the princes."
Arise, O God! judge the earth! For all the nations are thy possession.

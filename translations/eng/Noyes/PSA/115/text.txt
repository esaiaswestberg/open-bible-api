Not unto us, O LORD! not unto us, But unto thy name, give glory, For thy mercy and thy truth’s sake!
Why should the nations say, "Where is now their God?"
Our God is in the heavens; He doeth whatever he pleaseth.
Their idols are silver and gold, The work of men’s hands:
They have mouths, but they speak not; Eyes have they, but they see not;
They have ears, but they hear not; Noses have they, but they smell not;
They have hands, but they handle not; They have feet, but they walk not; Nor do they speak with their throats.
They who make them are like unto them; And so is every one that trusteth in them.
O Israel! trust thou in the LORD! He is their help and their shield.
O house of Aaron! trust ye in the LORD! He is their help and their shield.
Ye that fear the LORD trust in the LORD! He is their help and their shield.
The LORD hath been mindful of us; he will bless us; He will bless the house of Israel; He will bless the house of Aaron.
He will bless them that fear the LORD, both small and great.
The LORD will increase you more and more, You and your children.
Blessed are ye of the LORD, Who made heaven and earth.
The heaven is the LORD’S heaven; But the earth he hath given to the sons of men.
The dead praise not the LORD,—No one who goeth down into silence.
But we will bless the LORD, From this time forth even for ever! Praise ye the LORD!

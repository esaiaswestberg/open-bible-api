Preserve me, O God! for to thee do I look for help.
I have said to Jehovah, Thou art my Lord; I have no happiness beyond thee!
The holy that are in the land, and the excellent,—in them is all my delight.
They who hasten after other gods shall have multiplied sorrows; Their drink-offerings of blood I will not offer, Nor will I take their names upon my lips.
Jehovah is my portion and my cup; Thou wilt maintain my lot!
My portion hath fallen to me in pleasant places; Yea, I have a goodly inheritance.
I will bless the LORD, who careth for me; Yea, in the night my heart admonisheth me.
I set the LORD before me at all times; Since he is at my right hand, I shall not fall.
Therefore my heart is glad, and my spirit rejoiceth; Yea, my flesh dwelleth in security.
For thou wilt not give me up to the underworld; Nor wilt thou suffer thy holy one to see the pit.
Thou wilt show me the path of life; In thy presence is fulness of joy; At thy right hand are pleasures for evermore.

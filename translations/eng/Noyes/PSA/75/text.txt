We give thanks to thee, O God! we give thanks to thee, and near is thy name; Men shall declare thy wondrous deeds!
"When I see my time, Then will I judge with equity.
The earth trembleth, and all her inhabitants; But I uphold her pillars."
I say to the proud, Behave not proudly! To the wicked, Lift not up your horn!
Lift not up your horn on high, And speak not with a stiff neck!
For promotion cometh neither from the east, nor from the west, nor from the south;
But it is God that judgeth; He putteth down one, and setteth up another.
For in the hand of the LORD there is a cup; The wine is foaming and full of spices, And of it he poureth out; Even to the dregs shall all the wicked of the earth drink it.
Therefore I will extol him for ever; I will sing praise to the God of Jacob.
"I will bring down all the power of the wicked; But the righteous shall lift up their heads."

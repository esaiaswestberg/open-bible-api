Have pity upon me, O God! for man panteth for my life; My adversary daily oppresseth me!
Mine enemies daily pant for my life, And many are they who war proudly against me.
When I am in fear, I will put my trust in thee!
Through God shall I praise his word; In God do I put my trust; I will not fear; What can flesh do to me?
Every day they wrest my words; All their thoughts are against me for evil.
They gather themselves together, they hide themselves, they watch my steps, Lying in wait for my life.
Shall they escape by their iniquity? In thine anger cast down the people, O God!
Count thou my wanderings; Put my tears into thy bottle! Are they not recorded in thy book?
When I cry to thee, my enemies shall turn back; This I know, that God is for me.
Through God shall I praise his word; I shall glory in the promise of Jehovah.
In God do I put my trust; I will not fear: What can man do to me?
Thy vows are upon me, O God! I will render praises to thee!
For thou hast delivered me from death, Yea, my feet from falling, That I may walk before God in the light of the living.

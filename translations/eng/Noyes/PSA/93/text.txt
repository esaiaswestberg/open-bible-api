Jehovah reigneth; he is clothed with majesty; Jehovah is clothed with majesty, and girded with strength; Therefore the earth standeth firm, and cannot be moved.
Thy throne was established of old; Thou art from everlasting!
The floods, O LORD! lift up, The floods lift up their voice; The floods lift up their roaring!
Mightier than the voice of many waters, Yea, than the mighty waves of the sea, Is the LORD in his lofty habitation.
Thy promises are most sure; Holiness becometh thy house, O LORD! for ever!

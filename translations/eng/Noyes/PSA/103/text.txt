Bless the LORD, O my soul! And all that is within me, bless his holy name!
Bless the LORD, O my soul! And forget not all his benefits!
Who forgiveth all thine iniquities; Who healeth all thy diseases;
Who redeemeth thy life from the grave; Who crowneth thee with loving-kindness and tender mercies;
Who satisfieth thine old age with good, So that thy youth is renewed like the eagle’s.
The LORD executeth justice And equity for all the oppressed.
He made known his ways to Moses, His doings to the children of Israel.
The LORD is merciful and kind, Slow to anger and rich in mercy.
He doth not always chide, Nor doth he keep his anger for ever.
He hath not dealt with us according to our sins, Nor requited us according to our iniquities.
As high as are the heavens above the earth, So great is his mercy to them that fear him.
As far as the east is from the west, So far hath he removed our transgressions from us.
Even as a father pitieth his children, So the LORD pitieth them that fear him.
For he knoweth our frame, He remembereth that we are dust.
As for man, his days are as grass; As a flower of the field, so he flourisheth.
The wind passeth over it, and it is gone; And its place shall know it no more.
But the mercy of the LORD is from everlasting to everlasting to them that fear him, And his righteousness to children’s children,
To such as keep his covenant, And remember his commandments to do them.
The LORD hath established his throne in the heavens, And his kingdom ruleth over all.
Bless the LORD, ye his angels, Ye mighty ones who do his commands, Hearkening to the voice of his word!
Bless the LORD, all ye his hosts; Ye, his ministers, who do his pleasure!
Bless the LORD, all his works, In all places of his dominion! Bless the LORD, O my soul!

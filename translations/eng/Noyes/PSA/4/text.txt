Hear me, when I call, O God of my righteousness! Thou hast helped me, when I was in trouble,—Have pity upon me, and hear my prayer!
How long, O men! will ye dishonor my dignity? How long will ye love vanity, and seek disappointment? [Pause.]
Know ye that the LORD hath exalted one that is devoted to him; The LORD will hear, when I call upon him.
Stand in awe, and sin no more; Commune with your hearts upon your beds, and desist! [Pause.]
Offer sacrifices of righteousness, And put your trust in the LORD!
There are many who say, Who will show us any good? LORD, lift thou up the light of thy countenance upon us!
Thou puttest gladness into my heart, Greater than theirs, when their corn and wine are abundant.
I will lay me down in peace, and sleep: For thou alone, O LORD! makest me dwell in safety.

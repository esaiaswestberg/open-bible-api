Any person, moreover, whensoever he shall sin in that, when he heareth a voice of swearing, he himself, being a witness either seeing or knowing,—if he do not tell and so hath to bear his iniquity:—
Or, any person, who toucheth anything unclean, whether the carcase of an unclean wild-beast or the carcase of an unclean tame-beast, or the carcase of an unclean creeping thing,—and it is hidden from him, he himself being unclean, and he becometh aware of his guilt:—
Or whensoever one shall touch the uncleanness of man, as regardeth any uncleanness of his, wherewith one may become unclean,—and it be hidden from him, and then he himself, getting to know it becometh aware of his guilt:—
Or, any person, whensoever he shall swear, speaking unadvisedly with the lips, to harm or to help, as regardeth anything wherein the son of earth may speak unadvisedly by way of oath, and it be hidden from him,—and then, he himself, getting to know it, becometh aware of his guilt as regardeth any one of these things.
Then shall it be, when he becometh aware of his guilt, as regardeth any one of these things, that he shall confess that wherein he hath sinned;
and shall bring in as his guilt-bearer unto Yahweh for his sin which he hath committed, a female from the flock—a lamb or a kid of the goats—as a sin-bearer,—so shall the priest put propitiatory-covering over him, because of his sin.
And, if his hand cannot reach sufficient for a lamb, then shall he bring in to bear his guilt—for that he hath sinned—two turtle-doves, or two young pigeons unto Yahweh,—one for a sin-bearer, and one for an ascending-sacrifice.
And he shall take them in unto the priest, who shall bring near that which is for a sin-bearer first,—and shall nip through the neck close to the head but shall not divide it asunder.
And he shall sprinkle of the blood of the sin-bearer upon the wall of the altar, and the remainder of the blood, shall he drain out at the base of the altar,—a, sin-bearer, it is.
And of the second, shall he make an ascending-sacrifice according to the regulation,—so shall the priest put a propitiatory-covering over him, because of his sin which he hath committed and it shall be forgiven him.
But if his hand cannot lay hold of two turtledove, or two young pigeons, then shall he bring in as his oblation—because he hath sinned—the tenth of an ephah of fine meal for bearing sin,—he shall not put thereon oil, neither shall he lay thereon frankincense, for a sin-bearer, it is.
And he shall bring it in unto the priest, and the priest shall take therefrom a handful, as the memorial thereof, and shall make a perfume at the altar, upon the altar-flames of Yahweh,—a sin-bearer, it is.
So shall the priest put a propitiatory-covering over him, on account of his sin which he hath committed, departing from some one of these things, and it shall be forgiven him,—then shall it be the priest’s, like the meal-offering.
And Yahweh spake unto Moses, saying—
Whensoever, any person, shall commit a trespass, and shall take away by mistake, from the holy things of Yahweh, then shall he bring in as his guilt-bearer unto Yahweh, a ram without defect out of the flock, with thine estimate in silver by shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary, for a guilt-bearer:
that, moreover, which he took away from the sanctuary, shall he make good and the fifth part thereof, shall he add thereunto, and shall give it to the priest,—and, the priest, shall put a propitiatory-covering over him with the guilt-bearing ram and it shall be forgiven him.
And if any person when he shall sin, and do something, departing from any of the commandments of Yahweh, as to things which should not be done,—though he knew it not, shall so become guilty, and shall bear his iniquity,
then shall he bring in a ram without defect out of the flock by thine estimate as a guilt-bearer unto the priest,—and the priest shall put a propitiatory-covering over him, on account of his mistake which he made though he knew it not and it shall be forgiven him:
a guilt-bearer, it is,—he was, verily guilty against Yahweh.

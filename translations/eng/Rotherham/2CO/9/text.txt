For, indeed, concerning the ministry which is for the saints, it is, superfluous for me, to be writing to you;
For I know your forwardness of mind—of which, in your behalf, I am boasting unto Macedonians, that, Achaia, hath been prepared for a year past,—and, your zeal, hath stirred up the greater number of them.
Nevertheless I have sent the brethren, that, our boast in your behalf, be not made void, in this respect, that, even as I was saying, ye may be prepared,—
Lest by any means, if there should come with me Macedonians, and find you unprepared, we,—not to say, ye,—should be put to shame in this confidence.
Necessary, therefore, I regarded it, to exhort the brethren that they would go forward unto you, and make up beforehand your previously- promised blessing. The same, to be ready—thus, as a blessing, and not as of constraint.
As to this, however, he that soweth sparingly, sparingly, also shall reap, and, he that soweth with blessings, with blessings, also shall reap:
Each one, according as he hath purposed in his heart, not sorrowfully, nor of necessity,—for, a cheerful giver, God, loveth.
Moreover God is able to cause, every gracious gift, to superabound unto you, in order that, having in every thing, at every time, every kind of sufficiency of your own, ye may be superabounding unto every good work;
Even as it is written—He hath scattered abroad, he hath given to the needy,—his righteousness, abideth to futurity.
Now, he that supplieth seed to the sower, and bread for eating, will supply and multiply your seed for sowing, and cause to grow your fruits of righteousness:
In every thing, being enriched, unto every kind of liberality,—which, indeed, worketh out, through us, thanksgiving unto God;
Because, the ministry of this public service, is not only towards filling up the deficiencies of the saints, but also superabounding, through the thanksgiving of many, unto God,—
[Of many] who, through the proof of this ministry, are glorifying God for your acknowledged submission unto the glad-message of the Christ, and for the liberality of the fellowship, unto them, and unto all,—
Themselves also, with supplication on your behalf, longing after you, by reason of the surpassing favour of God [resting] upon you:—
Thanks be unto God, for his unspeakable bounty!

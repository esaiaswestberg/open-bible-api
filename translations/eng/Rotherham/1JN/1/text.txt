That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we for ourselves gazed upon, and our hands did handle, concerning the Word of Life,—
And, the Life, was made manifest, and we have seen, and are bearing witness, and announcing unto you, the Age-abiding Life, which, indeed, was with the Father, and was made manifest unto us;
That which we have seen and heard, are we announcing, even unto you, in order that, ye too, may have fellowship with us, and, our own fellowship also, may be with the Father, and with his Son Jesus Christ.
And, these things, are we writing, in order that, our joy, may be made full.
And this is the message which we have heard from him, and are reporting unto you,—that, God, is, light, and in him is, no darkness at all.
If we say—We have, fellowship, with him! and, in darkness, are walking, we are dealing falsely, and not doing the truth;
Whereas, if, in the light, we are walking, as, he, is in the light, we have, fellowship one with another, and, the blood of Jesus his Son, is cleansing us from all sin.
If we say—Sin, have we none! we are deceiving, ourselves, and, the truth, is not in us.
If we are confessing our sins, faithful, is he and, righteous—that he should forgive us our sins, and cleanse us from all unrighteousness.
If we say—We have not sinned! false, are we making, him, and, his word, is not in us.

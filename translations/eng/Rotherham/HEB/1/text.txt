Whereas, in many parts and in many ways of old, God spake unto the fathers, in the prophets,
At the end of these days, He hath spoken unto us in his Son,—whom he hath appointed heir of all things, through whom also he hath made the ages;
Who, being an eradiated brightness of his glory, and an exact representation of his very being, also bearing up all things by the utterance of his power, purification of sins, having achieved, sat down on the right hand of the majesty in high places:
By so much becoming superior to the messengers, by as much as, going beyond them, he hath inherited a more distinguished name.
For unto which of the messengers said he at any time—My Son, art, thou, I, this day have begotten thee? and again—I, will become, his father, and, he, shall become my Son?
But, whensoever he again introduceth the first-begotten into the habitable earth, he saith—And let all God’s messengers worship him!
Even as to the messengers, indeed, he saith—Who maketh his messengers, winds, and his ministers of state, a fiery flame;
but, as to the Son,—Thy throne, O God, is unto times age-abiding, and—A sceptre of equity, is the sceptre of his kingdom,
Thou hast loved righteousness, and hated lawlessness,—For this cause, hath God, thy God, anointed thee with the oil of exultation, beyond thy partners;
and—Thou, by way of beginning, Lord, the earth, didst found, and, the works of thy hands, are the heavens,—
They, shall perish, but, thou, abidest still, and, all, as a mantle, shall be worn out,
And, as if a robe, wilt thou fold them up,—as a mantle, and they shall be changed; but, thou, art the same, and thy years shall not fail.
But, to which of the messengers, hath he said, at any time—Sit thou at my right hand, until I make thy foes thy footstool?
Are they not, all, spirits, doing public service,—for ministry, sent forth, for the sake of them who are about to inherit salvation?

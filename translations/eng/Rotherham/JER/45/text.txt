The word which Jeremiah the prophet spake, unto Baruch son of Neriah,—when he had written these words upon a book, from the mouth of Jeremiah, in the fourth year of Jehoiakim son of Josiah, king of Judah saying—
Thus, saith Yahweh, God of Israel, Unto thee, O Baruch,—
Thou didst say, Surely woe to me! For Yahweh hath added sorrow unto my pain,—I am weary with my moaning, And rest, have I not found!
Thus, shalt thou say unto him Thus, saith Yahweh,—Lo! what I had built, I am pulling down, And what I had planted, I am rooting up,—And that is, all the land:
Wouldst, thou, then seek to secure for thyself great things? Do not seek! For behold me! bringing in calamity upon all flesh, Declareth Yahweh, Nevertheless I will give thee thine own life as a spoil, in all places whithersoever thou goest.

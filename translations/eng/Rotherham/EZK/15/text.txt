And the word of Yahweh came unto me saying:
Son of man, What can the vine-tree be more than any other tree,—any branch which hath been found among the trees of the forest?
Shall there be taken from it wood, to be made into any work? Or will men take therefrom a peg, to hang thereon any vessel?
Lo! into the fire, it is given up for fuel,— The two ends thereof, doth the fire devour, And the middle thereof is charred, Is it fit for any work?
Lo! while it was yet whole, it could not be made into any work,— how much less when !the fire hath devoured it. and it is charred, can it still be made into any work?
Therefore, Thus, saith My Lord Yahweh, As a vine-tree among the trees of the forest, which I have given up to the fire for fuel, so have I given up the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
Therefore will I set my face against them, Out of one fire, have they come forth But another fire, shall devour them,—So shall ye know that, I, am Yahweh, by my setting my face against them;
I will therefore give up the land as a desolation, —because they have committed treachery, Declareth My Lord., Yahweh.

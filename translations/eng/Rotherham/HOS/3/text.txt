Then said Yahweh unto me, Once more, go love a woman who loveth a friend, and is an adulteress,—according to the love of Yahweh unto the sons of Israel, though they keep turning away unto other gods, and love [idolatrous] raisin-cakes.
So I secured her to me, for fifteen pieces of silver,—and a homer of barley, and a half-homer of barley;
and I said unto her, Many days, shalt thou tarry for me, thou shalt not be unchaste, neither shalt thou become another man’s,—moreover also, I, [will tarry] for thee.
For, many days, shall the sons of Israel tarry, without king, and without ruler, and without sacrifice, and without pillar; and without ephod, or household gods.
Afterwards, shall the sons of Israel return, and seek Yahweh their God, and David their king,—and shall turn with throbbing hearts unto Yahweh and unto his goodness, in the afterpart of the days.

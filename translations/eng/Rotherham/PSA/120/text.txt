Unto Yahweh, in the distress that befell me, I cried—and he answered me.
O Yahweh! rescue thou my soul—from the false lip, from the deceitful tongue.
What shall be given to thee, and what shall be added to thee, thou deceitful tongue?
The arrows of the hero sharpened, with burning coals of broom.
Woe is me, That I sojourn in Meshek,—That I abide near the tents of Kedar!
Long, hath my soul had her dwelling with him that hateth peace:
I, am for peace, and verily I speak, They, are for war!

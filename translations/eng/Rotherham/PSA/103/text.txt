Bless, O my soul, Yahweh,—And all that is within me, his holy Name;
Bless, O my soul, Yahweh, And forget not all his dealings:—
Who forgiveth all thine iniquity, Who healeth all thy diseases;
Who redeemeth, from destruction, thy life, Who crowneth thee, with lovingkindness and compassion:
Who satisfieth, with good, thine age, Thy youth, reneweth itself like an eagle.
Yahweh is one, who executeth righteousness, Yea vindication for all the oppressed.
Who made known his ways unto Moses, unto the sons of Israel, his doings.
Compassionate and gracious, is Yahweh,—Slow to anger and abundant in lovingkindness.
Not perpetually, will he contend, Nor age-abidingly, retain anger;
Not according to our sins, hath he dealt with us, Nor according to our iniquities, hath he treated us.
For, as the heavens are exalted over the earth, His lovingkindness hath prevailed over them who revere him;
As far as East from West, Hath he put far from us, our transgressions;
Like the compassion of a father for his children, Is, the compassion of Yahweh, for them who revere him;
For, he, knoweth how we are formed, He is mindful that, dust, we are.
As for man, like grass, are his days, Like the blossom of the field, so, doth he blossom;
For, a wind, hath passed over it, and it is gone, And its own place is acquainted with it no more.
But, the lovingkindness of Yahweh, is from one age even to another, Upon them who revere him, And his righteousness, to children’s children:—
To such as keep his covenant, And remember his precepts, to do them.
Yahweh, in the heavens, hath established his throne, And, his kingdom, over all, hath dominion.
Bless Yahweh, ye messengers of his,—Heroes of vigour, doing his word, To hearken [again] to the voice of his word;
Bless Yahweh, all ye his hosts, Attendants of his, doing his pleasure;
Bless Yahweh, all ye his works, In all places of his dominion, Bless, O my soul, Yahweh.

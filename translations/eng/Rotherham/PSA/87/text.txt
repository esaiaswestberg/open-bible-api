His foundation, is in the holy mountains:
Yahweh loveth the gates of Zion, More than all the dwellings of Jacob.
Glorious things, are to be spoken of thee, O city of God. [Selah.]
I will mention Rahab and Babylon, to them who know me—Lo! Philistia and Tyre with Ethiopia, This one was born there.
But, of Zion, it shall be said—This man and that were born in her, And the Highest himself shall establish her.
Yahweh, will record, when he enrolleth the peoples, This one was born there. [Selah.]
As well the singers as the flute-players [are saying],—All my springs, are in thee!

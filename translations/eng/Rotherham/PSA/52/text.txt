Why dost thou boast thyself of wickedness, O mighty man? The lovingkindness of GOD, [lasteth] all the day.
Engulfing ruin, doth thy tongue devise, Like a whetted razor, working deceit;
Thou lovest Evil more than good, Falsehood, more than speaking righteousness. [Selah.]
Thou lovest all devouring words, O deceitful tongue!
GOD also, will break thee down utterly, He will snatch thee up and tear thee away tentless, And uproot thee, out of the land of the living. [Selah.]
The righteous shall both see and fear, And, over him, shall laugh:
Lo! the man who made not God his refuge,—But trusted in the abundance of his riches, Emboldened himself in his wealth!
But, I, am like a flourishing olive-tree, in the house of God, I have put confidence in the lovingkindness of God, for times age-abiding and beyond.
I will praise thee to times age-abiding, Because thou didst effectually work,—And I will wait on thy Name, Because it is good, In the presence of thy men of lovingkindness.

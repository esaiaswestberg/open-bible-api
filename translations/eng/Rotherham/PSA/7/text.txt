O Yahweh my God, in thee, have I sought refuge,—Save me from all my pursuers, and deliver me:
Lest one tear, as a lion, my soul,—and there be no deliverer to rescue.
O Yahweh my God, If I have done this, If there hath been perversity in my hands:
If I have requited my friend with wrong,—or have oppressed mine adversary without need,
Let an enemy pursue my soul, and overtake it, that he may tread down, to the earth, my life,—and, mine honour—in the dust, he may cause to dwell. [Selah.]
Rise! Yahweh! in thine anger, Lift thyself up, because of the haughty outbursts of mine adversaries, Stir up for me the justice thou hast commanded:
When, the assembly of peoples, gather round thee, then, above it—on high, do thou return!
Yahweh, will judge the peoples,—Do me justice, O Yahweh, according to my righteousness, and according to mine integrity upon me,
Let the wrong of the lawless, I pray thee, come to an end, and establish thou him that is righteous,—for, a trier of hearts and reins, is God the righteous one.
My shield, is held by God, who is ready to save the upright in heart:
A God to vindicate the righteous,—And yet a God to be indignant throughout every day.
If he turn not, his sword, will he whet,—his bow, hath he bent, and made ready:
But, for himself, hath he made ready the weapons so deadly, His arrows, he, so fiery, would make:
Lo! he gendereth trouble, and conceiveth mischief, but giveth birth to a disappointment:
A pit, he cut out, and digged it, and then fell into the ditch he had made:
His mischief, turneth back, on his own head,—and, on his own crown, his violence, descendeth.
I will praise Yahweh according to his righteousness,—and will praise in song the Name of Yahweh Most High.

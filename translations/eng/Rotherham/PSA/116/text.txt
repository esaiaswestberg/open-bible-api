I love Yahweh—because he heareth my voice, my supplications;
Because he hath bowed down his ear unto me, therefore, throughout my days, will I call.
The meshes of death encompassed me, and the distresses of hades, came upon me, Peril and sorrow, I found;
But, on the Name of Yahweh, I called—I beseech thee, Yahweh, deliver my soul.
Gracious is Yahweh and righteous, and, our God, is full of compassion.
Yahweh, preserveth the simple, I was brought low, when, to me, he granted salvation.
Return, O my soul, to thy rest, For, Yahweh, hath dealt bountifully with thee.
For thou hast rescued my soul from death,—mine eyes from tears, my feet from stumbling.
I will walk to and fro before Yahweh, in the lands of life.
I believed that I should speak, I, was greatly depressed.
I, said in mine alarm, All men, are false!
How shall I give back to Yahweh, All his benefits unto me?
The cup of salvation, will I lift, and, on the Name of Yahweh, will I call:
My vows—to Yahweh, will I pay, Might it be in presence of all his people!
Costly in the eyes of Yahweh, is, death, for his men of lovingkindness.
I beseech thee, O Yahweh—for, I, am thy servant,—I, am thy servant, the son of thy handmaid, Thou hast loosened my bonds.
To thee, will I sacrifice a sacrifice of thanksgiving, and, on the Name of Yahweh, will I call:
My vows—to Yahweh, will I pay, Might it be in the presence of all his people;—
In the courts of the house of Yahweh, In the midst of thee, O Jerusalem. Praise ye Yah!

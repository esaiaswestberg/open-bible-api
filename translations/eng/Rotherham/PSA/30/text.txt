I will extol thee, O Yahweh, for thou hast drawn me up,—and not suffered my foes to rejoice over me.
O Yahweh, my God, I cried for help unto thee, and thou hast healed me.
O Yahweh! thou hast lifted, out of hades, my soul, Thou hast brought me back to life, from among those who were going down to the pit.
Sweep the strings to Yahweh, ye his men of lovingkindness, and give ye praise at the mention of his holiness.
For there is, a Moment, in his anger, a Life-time, in his good-pleasure, In the evening, cometh Weeping to lodge, But, by the morning, ’tis a Shout of Triumph!
But, I, said, in my tranquility, I shall not be shaken to times age-abiding!
O Yahweh, in thy good-pleasure, hadst thou caused my mountain to stand, strong,—Thou didst hide thy face—I was dismayed!
Unto thee, O Yahweh, do I cry,—and, unto My Lord, do I make supplication:
What profit in my blood? in my going down into the pit? Can dust praise thee? Can it declare thy faithfulness?
Hear, O Yahweh, and show me favour, O Yahweh! become thou a helper unto me.
Thou hast turned my lamentation, into a dance for me,—Thou hast torn off my sackcloth, and girded me with gladness:
To the end that mine honour should make melody unto thee, and not be silent. O Yahweh, my God! Unto times age-abiding, will I praise thee.

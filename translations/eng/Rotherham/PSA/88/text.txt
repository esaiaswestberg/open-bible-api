O Yahweh, God of my salvation, By day, have I made outcry, In the night, [also] before thee.
Let my prayer, come into thy presence, Bow down thine ear to my loud cry.
For my soul, is sated with misfortunes, And, my life—unto Hades, hath drawn near;
I am counted with them who descend into the pit, I have become as a man that is without help;
Among the dead, is my couch,—Like the slain that lie in the grave, Where thou rememberest them no more, Yea, they, from thy hand, are cut off;
Thou hast laid me, In the lowest pit, In dark places, In the deeps:
Upon me, hath rested thine indignation, And, with all thy breakers, hast thou caused affliction. [Selah.]
Thou hast far removed mine acquaintances from me,—Thou hast made me an abomination unto them, Shut up, and I cannot go forth!
Mine eye, hath dimmed through affliction; I have called upon thee, O Yahweh, all day long, I have spread out, unto thee, my hands.
For the dead, wilt thou perform a wonder? Or shall, the shades, arising, give thee thanks? [Selah.]
Shall Thy lovingkindness be recounted in the grave? Thy faithfulness, in destruction?
Shall any wonder of thine, be known in the dark? Or, thy righteousness, in the land of forgetfulness?
But, I, unto thee, O Yahweh, have cried for help, And, in the morning, my prayer will confront thee!
Wherefore, O Yahweh, shouldst thou reject my soul? shouldst thou hide thy face from me?
Afflicted have I been, and dying, from youth, I have borne the terror of thee—I shall be distracted!
Over me, have passed thy bursts of burning anger, The alarms of thee have put an end to me;
They have surrounded me like waters, all the day, They have come circling against me together:
Thou hast far removed from me, lover and friend, Mine acquaintances, are in darkness.

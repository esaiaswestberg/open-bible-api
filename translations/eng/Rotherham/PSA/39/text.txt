I said, [to myself,] I will take heed to my ways, That I sin not with my tongue,—I will put on my mouth a muzzle, So long as the lawless is before me.
I was dumb with silence, I held my peace, afar from happiness, But, my pain had been stirred:
Hot was my heart within me, While I was musing, there was kindled a fire, I spake with my tongue!
Let me know, O Yahweh, mine end, And the measure of my days—what it is, I would know how short-lived I am.
Lo! as hand-breadths, hast thou granted my days, and my life-time, is as nothing before thee,—Surely, a mere breath, are all men, [even] such as stand firm. [Selah.]
Surely as a shadow, doth every man wander, Surely in vain, do they bustle about, he heapeth things up, and knoweth not who shall gather them in.
Now, therefore, for what have I waited, O My Lord? My hope, is, in thee.
From all my transgressions, rescue thou me,—The reproach of the base, oh do not make me!
I am dumb, I cannot open my mouth, for, thou, hast done it.
Remove from off me thy stroke, Because of the hostility of thy hand, am, I, consumed.
When, by rebukes for iniquity, thou hast corrected a man, Then hast thou consumed, as a moth, all that was delightful within him, Surely, a breath, are all men. [Selah.]
Hear my prayer, O Yahweh, And, unto my cry for help, give ear, At my tears, do not be silent,—For, a sojourner, am, I, with thee, A stranger, like all my fathers.
Look away from me that I may brighten up, Ere yet I depart and am no more.

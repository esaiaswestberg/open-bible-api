If, Yahweh, build not the house, in vain, have the builders of it toiled thereon, If, Yahweh, watch not the city, in vain, hath the watchman kept awake:
Vain for you,—to be early in rising, to be late in lying down, to be eating the bread of wearisome toil, So, would he give his beloved one sleep.
Lo! an inheritance from Yahweh, are children, A reward, the fruit of the womb:
As arrows in the hand of a warrior, so, are the children of young men.
How happy the man who hath filled his quiver with them! They will not be ashamed, but will speak with enemies in the gate.

Of lovingkindness and of justice, will I sing! Unto thee, O Yahweh, will I touch the strings!
I will behave myself wisely in a blameless way, When wilt thou come in unto me? I will walk to and fro in the blamelessness of my heart,—in the midst of my house:
I will not set before mine eyes, a vile thing,—The doing of them who fall away, I hate, It shall not cleave unto me;
A perverse heart, shall depart from me, A maker of mischief, will I not acknowledge;
He that uttereth slander in secret against his friend, him, will I root out; One of lofty eyes, and of an ambitious heart, him shall I not be able to endure.
Mine eyes, shall be upon the faithful of the land, That they may dwell with me,—he that walketh in a blameless way, he, shall attend me.
There shall not dwell in the midst of my house, One who worketh deceit,—he that speaketh falsehoods, shall not be established before mine eyes;
Morning by morning, will I uproot, All the lawless ones of the land, That I may cut off, out of the city of Yahweh—All the workers of iniquity.

Unto thee, have I lifted up mine eyes, O thou who art enthroned in the heavens.
Lo! as the eyes of men-servants are unto the hand of their masters, as the eyes of a maid-servant, unto the hand of her mistress, so, are our eyes, unto Yahweh our God, until that he show us favour.
Show us favour, O Yahweh, show us favour, for, exceedingly, are we sated with contempt:
Exceeding sated therewith, is our soul,—The scorn of the careless, The contempt of the proud.

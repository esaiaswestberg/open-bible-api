Give to Yahweh, ye sons of the mighty,—Give to Yahweh, [both] glory and strength:
Give to Yahweh, the glory of his Name, Bow down to Yahweh, in the adornment of holiness.
The voice of Yahweh, is upon the waters,—The GOD of glory, hath thundered, Yahweh, is upon mighty waters;
The voice of Yahweh, is with power, The voice of Yahweh, is with majesty;
The voice of Yahweh, is breaking cedars, Now hath Yahweh, broken down, the cedars of Lebanon!
And hath made them leap like a calf, Lebanon and Sirion, like the bull-calf of wild-oxen;
The voice of Yahweh, is cleaving out flames of fire;
The voice of Yahweh, bringeth birth-pains upon the wilderness; Yahweh bringeth birth-pains upon the wilderness of Kadesh!
The voice of Yahweh, causeth the gazelles to bring forth, and hath stript forests; and, in his own temple, every one there, is saying, Glory!
Yahweh, at the Flood, was seated, And Yahweh hath taken his seat, as king, unto times age-abiding.
Yahweh, will give, strength to his people,—Yahweh, will bless his people with prosperity.

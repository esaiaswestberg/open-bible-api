God—for us, is a refuge and strength, A help in distresses, soon found.
For this cause, will we not fear, Though the earth showeth change, Or the mountains slip into the heart of the seas:
The waters thereof roar and foam, The mountains tremble with the swelling thereof [Selah.]
A river! whose channels, shall gladden the city of God, The Most High, hath hallowed his habitation.
God, is in the midst of her, she shall not be shaken, God will help her, by the turnings of the morning.
Nations have roared, Kingdoms have tottered, He hath uttered his voice, Earth melteth.
Yahweh of hosts, is with us, A high tower for us, is the God of Jacob. [Selah.]
Come! view the doings of Yahweh,—Who hath set desolations in the earth;
Causing wars to cease unto the end of the earth,—The bow, he shivereth, And breaketh in pieces the spear, war-chariots, burneth he up with fire.
Let be! and know that, I, am God, I will be exalted among the nations, I will be exalted in the earth.
Yahweh of hosts, is with us, A high tower for us, is the God of Jacob. [Selah.]

Sing to Yahweh, a song that is new, Sing to Yahweh, all the earth;
Sing to Yahweh, bless ye his Name,—Tell the tidings, from day to day, of his salvation:
Recount, Among the nations, his glory, Among all the peoples, his wonders.
For great is Yahweh, and worthy to be mightily praised, To be revered is he above all gods;
For, all the gods of the peoples, are things of nought—But, Yahweh, made, the heavens.
Praise and majesty, are before him, Strength and beauty, are in his sanctuary.
Give to Yahweh, ye families of the peoples, Give to Yahweh, glory and strength;
Give to Yahweh, the glory of his Name, Bring a present, and enter his courts;
Bow down to Yahweh, in the adornment of holiness, Be in anguish at his presence, all the earth!
Say among the nations, Yahweh, hath become King, Surely he hath fixed the world, it shall not be shaken, He will judge the peoples with equity.
Let the heavens rejoice, and the earth exult, Let the sea roar, and the fulness thereof;
Let the field, leap for joy, and all that is therein, Then, shall all the trees of the forest, shout in triumph,
Before Yahweh, for he is coming, For he is coming to judge the earth,—He will judge the world, in righteousness, And the peoples, in his faithfulness.

Rescue me, O Yahweh, from the men of mischief, From the men of violence, wilt thou preserve me:
Who have devised mischiefs in their [heart], Every day, do they stir up wars:
They have sharpened their tongue like a serpent,—The poison of the asp, is under their lips. [Selah.]
Keep me, O Yahweh, from the hands of the lawless one, From the man of violence, wilt thou preserve me,—who have devised, to thrust at my steps:
The proud have hidden a snare for me, and, cords, have they spread as a net beside the track, Snares, have they set for me. [Selah.]
I have said unto Yahweh, My GOD, thou art! Give ear, O Yahweh, unto the voice of my supplications.
O Yahweh, My Lord, my saving strength, thou hast screened my head in the day of battle.
Do not grant, O Yahweh, the desires of the lawless one, his device, do not promote, They would exalt themselves. [Selah.]
As for the head of them who surround me, Let the mischief of their lips cover them:
May there be dropped on them live coals,—Into the fire, may they be let fall, into watery pits [from which] they shall not rise.
As for the slanderer, let him not be established in the earth,—As for the man of wrongful violence, let misfortune hunt him with thrust upon thrust.
I know that Yahweh will execute, the right of the oppressed one, the vindication of the needy.
Surely, the righteous, shall give thanks to thy Name, the upright shall dwell in thy presence.

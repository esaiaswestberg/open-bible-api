When Yahweh brought back the captives of Zion, we were like them who dream:
Then, was our mouth, filled with laughter, and our tongue with a shout of triumph,—Then, said they among the nations, Yahweh, hath done great things, with these!
Yahweh, hath done great things with us, we are full of joy!
Bring thou back, O Yahweh, our captives, like channels in the South.
They who are sowing with tears, with shouting, shall reap:
He that, doth indeed go forth, and weep, bearing seed enough to trail along, doth, surely come in, with shouting, bringing his sheaves.

Yahweh, is my light and my salvation, Of whom shall I be afraid? Yahweh, is the refuge of my life, Of whom shall I be in dread?
When there drew near against me evil-doers to devour my flesh, mine adversaries, and mine enemies—mine!—they, stumbled and fell!
Though there pitch against me—a camp, my heart shall not fear,—Though there come up against me—a battle, still, am I confident.
One thing, have I asked of Yahweh, That, will I seek to secure,—That I may dwell in the house of Yahweh, all the days of my life, To view the delightfulness of Yahweh, And to contemplate in his temple.
For he will hide me in his pavilion, in the day of calamity,—He will conceal me, in the secrecy of his tent, Within a rock, will he set me on high.
Now, therefore, shall my head be raised high above my foes round about me, and I will sacrifice in his tent the sacrifices of triumphant joy, I will sing and touch the strings, to Yahweh.
Hear, O Yahweh, With my voice, do I cry, Oh then show me favour and answer me.
To thee, said my heart—[When thou saidst] Seek ye my face—Thy face, O Yahweh, will I seek!
Do not hide thy face from me, Do not repulse, in thine anger, thine own servant,—My help, thou hast been, Do not send me away nor forsake me, O my saving God!
When, my own father and mother, had forsaken me, Then, Yahweh, took me up!
Point out to me, O Yahweh, thy way,—And guide me in a level path, because of mine adversaries.
Do not give me up unto the desire of mine adversaries, for there have risen up against me witnesses that are false, and he that fanneth up violence.
I believe that I shall see—The goodness of Yahweh in the land of the living,
Wait thou for Yahweh,—Be strong, and let thy heart be bold, Wait, then, for Yahweh!

Yahweh, is my shepherd—I shall not want:
In pastures of tender grass, he maketh me lie down, Unto restful waters, he leadeth me;
My life, he restoreth, He guideth me in right paths, for the sake of his Name.
Yea, though I walk through a valley death-shadowed, I will fear no harm, for, thou, art with me, Thy rod and thy staff, they, comfort me.
Thou spreadest before me a table, in face of mine adversaries, Thou hast anointed, with oil, my head, My cup, hath run over.
Surely, goodness and lovingkindness, will pursue me, all the days of my life, and I shall dwell in the house of Yahweh, evermore.

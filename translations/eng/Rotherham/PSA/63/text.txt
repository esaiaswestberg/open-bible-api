O God, my GOD, thou art, Earnestly do I desire thee,—My soul thirsteth for thee, My flesh fainteth for thee, In a land—dry, and weary for want of water,—
In like manner as, in the sanctuary, I have had vision of thee, To behold thy power and thy glory.
Because better is thy lovingkindness than life, My lips, aloud shall praise thee!
Thus, will I bless thee while I live, In thy Name, will I lift up mine outspread hands:
As with fatness and richness, shall my soul be satisfied, And, with joyfully shouting lips, shall my mouth utter praise.
Should I call thee to mind upon my couch, In the watches of the night, would I breathe soft speech of thee.
For thou hast become a help unto me,—And, in the shadow of thy wings, will I shout for joy.
My soul hath run clinging to thee, On me, hath thy right hand laid hold.
When, they, to crush it, would seek my life, They shall go into the lower parts of the earth:
Every one shall be given up into the power of the sword, The portion of jackals, shall they become.
But, the king, shall rejoice in God,—Every one shall glory who sweareth by him, For the mouth of them who speak falsehood, shall be stopped.

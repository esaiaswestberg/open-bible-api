O GOD of avenging—Yahweh, GOD of avenging, shine forth:
Lift up thyself, O judge of the earth, Render a recompense unto the proud.
How long shall the lawless, O Yahweh, How long shall the lawless exult?
They pour forth [words], they speak arrogantly, All the workers of iniquity, do boast:
Thy people, O Yahweh, they will crush, And, thine inheritance, tread down;
The widow and sojourner, they will slay, And, the fatherless, murder.
Yet have they said—Yah, doth not see, The God of Jacob, doth not understand.
Understand, ye brutish among the people, And, ye dullards, when will ye show discretion?
He that planteth the ear, shall he not hear? Or, that fashioneth the eye, shall he not have power to see?
He that correcteth nations, shall he not reprove? He that teacheth man knowledge!
Yahweh, knoweth the plans of men, That, they, are a breath!
How happy the man whom thou correctest, O Yah! And whom, out of thy law, thou instructest!
That thou mayest give him rest from the days of misfortune, Until there be digged—for the lawless one—a pit.
For Yahweh, will not abandon, his people, And, his inheritance, will he not forsake;
For, unto righteousness, shall the judicial sentence return, Then shall follow it—all the upright in heart.
Who will rise up for me, against the evil-doers? Who will make a stand for me, against the workers of iniquity?
If, Yahweh, had not been a help to me, Soon had sunk into silence—my soul!
If I say, My foot, hath slipped, Thy lovingkindness, O Yahweh, supporteth me.
In the multitude of my cares within me, Thy consolations, delight my soul.
Shall the throne that inflicteth ruin, have fellowship with thee, That frameth oppression, by statute?
They make an attack on the life of the righteous one,—And, innocent blood, they condemn.
But, Yahweh, hath become for me a high tower, And my God, my rock of refuge.
Thus hath he brought back on them their iniquity, And, by their own wickedness, will he destroy them, Destroy them, will Yahweh our God.

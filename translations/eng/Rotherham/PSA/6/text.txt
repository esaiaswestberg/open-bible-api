O Yahweh! do not, in thine anger, correct me, nor, in thy wrath, chastise me.
Show me favour, O Yahweh, for languishing am I: Heal me, O Yahweh,—for dismayed are my bones:
Yea, my soul, is dismayed greatly, Thou, then, O Yahweh—how long?
Return, O Yahweh, deliver my soul, Save me, for the sake of thy lovingkindness;
For, in death, is no remembrance of thee,—In hades, who shall give thanks unto thee?
I am weary with my sighing, I flood, through the whole night, my couch,—With my tears, I cause, my bed, to dissolve:
My face, is all sunken with sorrow,—it hath aged, because of all mine adversaries.
Depart from me, all ye workers of iniquity, for Yahweh hath heard the voice of my weeping:
Yahweh, hath heard my supplication, Yahweh, will receive, my prayer.
Let all my foes, turn pale and be greatly dismayed, Again let them turn pale in a moment.

In that day, there shall be an opened fountain, for the house of David, and for the Inhabitants of Jerusalem,—for sin and for uncleanness.
And it shall come to pass, in that day, declareth Yahweh of hosts, That I will cut off the names of idols out of the land, and they shall not be remembered any more,—Moreover also, even the prophets and the spirit of impurity, will I cause to pass away out of the land.
So shall it come about that, when any man shall prophesy again, then will his own father and his own mother, of whom he was born, say unto him,—Thou shalt not live! For falsehood hast thou spoken in the name of Yahweh,—So will his own father and his own mother of whom he was born, pierce him through, when he prophesieth,
Yea it shall come to pass, in that day, that the prophets, will turn pale, every man by reason of his vision when he prophesieth,—neither will they put on a mantle of hair to deceive.
But he will say, No prophet, am I,—One tilling the ground, am I, for, one of the common people, hath owned me from my youth.
Then will one say unto him, What are these wounds between thy hands? And he will say, Wherewith I was wounded in the house of them who loved me.
O Sword! awake against my shepherd, even against the man that is my companion, urgeth Yahweh of hosts,—Smite the shepherd, and let the flock, be scattered, Howbeit I will turn back my hand over the little ones.
And it shall come to pass, in all the land, declareth Yahweh, Two-thirds therein, shall be cut off, and expire,—but, a third, shall be left therein;
And I will bring the third into the fire, and will smelt them as one smelteth silver, and will try them, as one trieth gold,—It, will call upon my name, and, I, will answer it, and will say, My people, it is! and, it, will say, Yahweh, is my God!

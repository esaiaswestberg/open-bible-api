And he shewed me, Joshua the high priest, standing before the messenger of Yahweh,—and, the Accuser, standing at his right hand, to accuse him.
Then said Yahweh unto the Accuser, Yahweh rebuke thee, O Accuser, Yea Yahweh rebuke thee, he who is choosing Jerusalem,—Is not, this, a brand snatched out of the fire?
Now, Joshua, was clothed with filthy garments,—though standing before the messenger.
Then responded he and spake unto those who were standing before him, saying, Take away the filthy garments from off him; and he said unto him, See! I have caused to pass from off thee, thine iniquity, And will cause thee to be clothed in robes of state.
Then said I, Let them put a clean turban upon his head,—So they put the clean turban upon his head, and clothed him with garments, and, the messenger of Yahweh, was standing up.
So then the messenger of Yahweh did solemnly affirm unto Joshua, saying:
Thus, saith Yahweh of hosts, If, in my ways, thou wilt walk, and if, of my charge, thou wilt keep charge, Then, even thou, shalt govern my house, Moreover also, thou shalt have charge of my courts,—and I will give thee free access among these who stand by.
Hear, I pray thee, O Joshua the high priest, thou and thy friends who are sitting before thee, for, men to serve as signs, they are,—For behold me! bringing in my servant, the Bud;
For lo! the stone which I have set before Joshua, Upon one stone, are Seven (pairs of) Eyes,—Behold me! cutting the engraving thereof, declareth Yahweh of hosts. So will I take away the iniquity of that land in one day.
In that day, declareth Yahweh of hosts, Ye shall invite one another,—[to come] under the vine and under the fig-tree.

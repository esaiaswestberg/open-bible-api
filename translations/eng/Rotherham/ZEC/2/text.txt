Then lifted I up mine eyes and looked, and lo! a Man,—and, in his hand, a Measuring Line.
And I said, Whither art thou going? And he said unto me, To measure Jerusalem, to see what [should be] the breadth thereof, and what the length thereof.
And lo! the messenger who was talking with me, coming forward,—and another messenger, coming forward to meet him.
So he said unto him, Run, speak unto this young man, saying: Like open villages, shall Jerusalem remain, for the multitude of men and cattle in her midst;
And, I, will become to her, declareth Yahweh, A wall of fire round about,—and, a glory, will I become in her midst.
Ho! ho! flee ye, therefore, out of the land of the North, urgeth Yahweh. For, as the four winds of the heavens, have I spread you abroad, declareth Yahweh.
Ho! Zion, deliver thyself,—thou that dwellest with the daughter of Babylon. For,
Thus, saith Yahweh of hosts, For his own honour, hath he sent me unto the nations that are spoiling you,—Surely, he that toucheth you, toucheth the pupil of mine eye.
For behold me! brandishing my hand over them, and they shall become a spoil unto their own slaves,—and ye shall know that, Yahweh of hosts, hath sent me.
Sing out and rejoice, O daughter of Zion,—For behold me! coming in, and I will make my habitation in thy midst, declareth Yahweh.
Then shall many nations, join themselves, unto Yahweh, in that day, and shall become my people,—and I will make my habitation in thy midst, so shalt thou know that, Yahweh of hosts, hath sent me unto thee.
Thus will Yahweh inherit Judah, his portion, on the soil of the sanctuary,—and make choice, yet again, of Jerusalem.
Hush! all flesh, before Yahweh,—For he hath roused himself up out of his holy dwelling.

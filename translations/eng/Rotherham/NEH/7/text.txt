And it came to pass, when the wall was built, and I had set up the doors,—and the doorkeepers and the singers and the Levites had been appointed,
that I gave Hanani my brother, and Hananiah captain of the castle, charge over Jerusalem, for, he, was a truly faithful man, and revered God above many.
And I said unto them, Let not the gates of Jerusalem be opened until, hot, be the sun, and, while they are standing by, let them close the doors, and make them fast,—setting watches, of the inhabitants of Jerusalem, every one in his watch, and every one over against his own house.
Now, the city, was broad on both hands, and large, but, the people, were few in the midst thereof,—and the houses had not been built.
So then my God put it into my heart, and I gathered together the nobles and the deputies and the people, to register their genealogy,—then found I a register roll, of them who came up at the first, and found written therein:—
These, are the sons of the province, who came up from among the Captives of the Exile, whom Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon did exile,—but they came back to Jerusalem and to Judah, every one to his own city;

And, these, are they who came up from Tel-melah, Tel-harsha, Cherub, Addon, and Immer,—but they could not tell their ancestral house, nor their seed, whether, of Israel, they were:
the sons of Delaiah, the sons of Tobiah, the sons of Nekoda,—six hundred and forty-two,
And, of the priests, the sons of Hobaiah, the sons of Hakkoz,—the sons of Barzillai, who had taken of the daughters of Barzillai the Gileadite to wife, and was called after their name.
These, sought their writing wherein they were registered, but it was not found,—so they were desecrated out of the priesthood;
and the governor told them, they must not eat of the most holy things,—until there should stand up a priest, with Lights and Perfections.
All the gathered host together, was forty-two thousand, three hundred, and sixty;
besides, their men-servants and maid-servants, were these, seven thousand, three hundred, and thirty-seven,—and, to them, pertained, singing-men and singing-women, two hundred, and forty-five:
their horses, were seven hundred, and thirty-six,—their mules, two hundred, and forty-five;
camels, four hundred, and thirty-five,—asses, six thousand, seven hundred, and twenty.
And, a portion of the ancestral chiefs, gave unto the work,—the governor, gave unto the treasury, of gold, a thousand darics, tossing bowls, fifty, tunics for priests, five hundred, and thirty;
and, some of the ancestral chiefs, gave unto the treasury of the work, of gold, twenty thousand darics,—and, of silver, two thousand and two hundred manehs;
and, that which the rest of the people gave, was, of gold, twenty thousand darics, and, of silver, two thousand manehs,—and, tunics for priests, sixty-seven.

Elders, therefore, among you, I exhort—[I] who am their co-elder and a witness of the sufferings of the Christ, who also, in the glory about to be revealed, have, a share;—
Shepherd the beloved flock of God, which is among you,—not by compulsion, but by choice, nor yet for base gain, but of a ready mind,—
Nor yet as lording it over the allotted portions, but becoming, ensamples, to the beloved flock;
And, when the Chief Shepherd is manifested, ye shall bear away, the unfading crown of glory.
In like manner, ye younger men—submit yourselves unto elders;—All, however, one towards another, gird on humility; because, God, against the haughty, arrayeth himself, whereas, unto the lowly, he giveth favour.
Be made lowly, therefore, under the strong hand of God, that he may lift, you, up in due time,—
All your anxiety, casting upon him, because he careth for you.
Be sober! be watchful! Your slanderous adversary, as a roaring lion, is walking about—seeking to devour:
Whom resist, steadfast in your faith, knowing that, the same sufferings, in your brotherhood that is in the world, are being accomplished.
Howbeit, the God of all favour—who hath called you unto his age-abiding glory in Christ—when, for a little, ye have suffered, Himself, will adjust, confirm, strengthen:—
Unto him, be the dominion, unto the ages. Amen!
By Silvanus, the faithful brother, as I account him, have I briefly written, unto you, exhorting and adding testimony—that, this, is the true favour of God—within which, stand ye fast!
She who, in Babylon, is co-elect, and Mark my son, salute you:
Salute ye one another with a kiss of love. Peace unto you all who are in Christ.

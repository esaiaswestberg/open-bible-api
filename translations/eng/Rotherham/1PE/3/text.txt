In like manner, ye wives,—submitting yourselves unto your own husbands; in order that, if any are not yielding unto the word, through their wives behaviour, they may, without the word, be won,
Having been permitted to behold your reverently chaste behaviour,—
Whose adorning, let it be—not the outward, of plaiting the hair and wearing golden ornaments, or putting on of apparel,
But the hidden character, of the heart,—in the incorruptible [ornament] of the quiet, and meek, spirit, which is, in presence of God, of great price.
For, so, at one time, the holy women also, who directed their hope towards God, used to adorn themselves, being in submission unto their own husbands:
As, Sarah, was obedient unto Abraham, calling him, lord,—whose children ye have become—so long as ye are doing good, and not bringing yourselves into fear of any single cause of alarm.
Ye husbands, in like manner, dwelling with them according to knowledge,—as unto a weaker vessel, unto the female [vessel], assigning honour, as joint—inheritors also of life’s favour,—to the end that unhindered may be, your prayers.
And, finally, all, being of one mind, having fellow—feeling, attached to the brethren, of tender affection, of lowly mind:
Not returning evil for evil, nor reviling for reviling, but, on the contrary, bestowing a blessing,—because, hereunto, have ye been called, in order that, a blessing, ye might inherit.
For, he that desireth to love, life, and to see good days, Let him cause his tongue to cease from mischief, and lips, that they speak not deceit;
Let him turn away from mischief, and do good, Let him seek peace, and pursue it;
Because, the eyes of the Lord, are towards the righteous, and his ears, unto their supplication,—Whereas, the face of the Lord, is against them that are doing mischievous things.
Who, then, is he that shall harm you, if, for that which is good, ye become zealous?
Nevertheless, even if ye should suffer for righteousness’ sake, happy [are ye] ! Their fear, however, do not fear, neither be troubled;
But, the Lord Christ, hallow ye in your hearts, ready always for a defence, unto every one that is asking you a reason concerning, the hope within you,—nevertheless, with meekness and reverence:
Having, a good conscience, in order that, wherein they speak against you, they may be put to shame who cast wanton insult on, your good behaviour in Christ.
For it is, better, as well-doers, if it should please the pleasure of God, to be suffering, than, as evil-doers:
Because, Christ also, once for all, concerning sins, died,—Just in behalf of unjust,—in order that he might introduce us unto God; being put to death, indeed, in flesh, but made alive in spirit,—
In which, even unto the spirits in prison, he went and proclaimed,—
[Spirits] unyielding at one time, when the longsuffering of God was holding forth a welcome in the days of Noah, there being in preparation an ark—[going] into which, a few, that is eight, souls, were brought safely through by means of water,—
Which [water] in manner corresponding, doth, now, save, you also—even immersion,—not a putting away of the filth of the flesh, but the request unto God, for a good conscience, through the resurrection of Jesus Christ,—
Who is on the right hand of God, having gone into heaven, messengers and authorities and powers, having been made subject unto him.

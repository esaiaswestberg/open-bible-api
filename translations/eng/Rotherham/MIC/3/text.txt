Then said I, Hear, I pray you, ye heads of Jacob, and ye judges of the house of Israel,—Is it not yours to know justice?
Ye haters of right, and lovers of wrong,—tearing away their skin from off them, and their flesh from off their bones;
Who indeed have eaten the flesh of my people, and, their skin from off them, have stript, and, their bones, have they broken in pieces,—and will spread them out, as flesh with a fork, and as flesh, in the midst of a pot.
Then, shall they make outcry unto Yahweh, but he will not answer them,—that he may hide his face from them, at that time, even as they have made wicked their doings.
Thus, saith Yahweh, concerning the prophets who are leading astray my people,—who bite with their teeth, and then cry—Prosper! and whoso holdeth not to their mouth, they hallow against him a war!
Therefore, shall it be night to you, for lack of vision, and darkness to you, for lack of divination,—and the sun, shall go in, over the prophets, and the day, shall be overcast because of them;
And the men of vision, shall turn pale, and the diviners, shall blush, and shall put a covering upon their lip, all of them,—because there is no answer of God.
But, in very deed, I, am full of vigour, with the spirit of Yahweh, and of justice and of valour,—to declare to Jacob, his transgression, and to Israel, his sin.
Hear this, I pray you, ye heads of the house of Jacob, and ye judges of the house of Israel,—who abhor justice, and, all right, do pervert:
Building Zion, with deeds of blood,—and Jerusalem, with perversity.
Her heads, for a bribe, pronounce sentence, and, her priests, for a price, give direction, and, her prophets, for silver, divine,—yet, on Yahweh, they lean, saying, Is not, Yahweh, in our midst? there shall not come upon us, calamity.
Wherefore, for your sake, Zion, as a field, shall be ploughed, and, Jerusalem, unto heaps of ruins, shall be turned,—and, the mountain of the house, shall [be] like mounds in a jungle.

Remember, O LORD, what has been to us; look down and see our shame.
Our inheritance has turned to aliens, our houses to foreigners.
We are orphans and fatherless; our mothers are as widows.
We have drunk our water for silver; our wood comes for a price.
We are pursued on our necks; we grow weary; rest is not given to us.
We have given the hand to Egypt, to Assyria, to be satisfied with bread.
Our fathers have sinned and are not; we have borne their iniquities.
Servants rule over us; there is no rescuer out of their hand.
We bring in our bread with our souls, because of the sword of the wilderness.
Our skin is hot like an oven because of the fever heat of famine.
They raped the women in Zion, virgins in the cities of Judah.
Rulers were hanged by the hand; the faces of elders were not honored.
They took the young men to grind, and the youths stumbled at the wood.
The elders have ceased from the gate, the young men from their music.
The joy of our heart has ceased; our dance has turned into mourning.
The crown has fallen from our head. Woe now to us! For we have sinned.
Our heart is faint for this; our eyes are dim for these things.
On the mountain of Zion is laid waste, the foxes walk on it.
You, O LORD, remain forever; Your throne to generation and generation.
Why do You forget us forever and forsake us the length of days?
Return us to You, O LORD, and we will turn; renew our days as of old,
unless You have utterly rejected us; You are very angry against us.

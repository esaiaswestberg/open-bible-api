Put a trumpet to your mouth. He comes like an eagle against the house of the LORD, because they have broken My covenant and have sinned against My law.
Israel shall cry to Me, My God, we know You.
Israel has thrown off good; the enemy shall pursue him.
They have set up kings, but not by Me; they have made rulers, and I knew it not. They have made themselves idols with their silver and their gold, so that they may be cut off.
Your calf, O Samaria, has cast you off. My anger is kindled against them. Until when will they not attain purity?
For from Israel it came also. The craftsman made it, but it is not God. For the calf of Samaria shall be splinters.
For they sow the wind, and they reap the whirlwind. It has no stalk; the bud shall yield no meal; if it does yield, strangers shall swallow it up.
Israel is swallowed up; now they shall be among the nations as a vessel in which there is no pleasure.
For they have gone up to Assyria, a wild ass alone by himself. Ephraim has hired lovers.
Yea, though they have hired among the nations, now I will gather them. And they began to be few, from the burden of the king of rulers.
Because Ephraim has made many altars to sin, altars shall be to him to sin.
I have written to him the great things of My law, but they were counted as a strange thing.
They sacrifice flesh for the sacrifices of My offerings, and eat it; but the LORD does not receive them. Now He will remember their iniquity and punish their sins. They shall return to Egypt.
For Israel has forgotten his Maker, and builds temples. And Judah has multiplied cities. But I will send a fire on his cities, and it shall burn up her palaces.

And Zophar the Naamathite answered and said,
Should not the multitude of words be answered? And should a man full of talk be justified?
Should your lies make men silent? And will you mock and no one make you ashamed?
For you have said, My doctrine is pure, and I am clean in Your eyes.
But who will grant that God would speak, and open His lips against you,
and would tell you the secrets of His wisdom, that sound wisdom is manifold? Know therefore that God forgets for you some of your iniquity.
Can you by searching find out God? Can you perfectly find out the Almighty?
Heights of the heavens! What can you do? It is deeper than hell, what can you know?
The measure of it is longer than the earth, and broader than the sea.
If He passes through and shuts up, or gathers together, then who can turn Him back?
For He knows vain men; and when He sees wickedness, will He not search it?
For foolish man would be wise, and man is born a wild ass's colt.
If you prepare your heart and stretch out your hands toward Him;
if iniquity is in your hand, put it far away, and do not let wickedness dwell in your tents;
surely then you shall lift up your face without spot; yea, you shall be steadfast and shall not fear;
for you shall forget your misery, and you shall remember it as waters that pass away.
And your lifetime shall be clearer than the noonday; though there be darkness, you shall be as the morning.
And you shall be safe, because there is hope; yea, you shall look around you, and you shall take your rest in safety.
You shall lie down, and none shall make you afraid. Yea, many shall seek your favor.
But the eyes of the wicked shall fail, and they shall have no escape, and their hope shall be like the giving up of the spirit.

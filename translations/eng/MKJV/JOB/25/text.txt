And Bildad the Shuhite answered and said,
Rule and fear are with Him; He makes peace in His high places.
Is there any number of His armies? And on whom does not His light arise?
How then can man be justified with God? Or how can one who is born of a woman be clean?
Look even to the moon, and it shines not; yea, the stars are not pure in His sight;
how much less man who is a maggot, and the son of man, who is a worm?

Lo, my eye has seen all this, my ear has heard and understood it.
What you know, I know also; I do not fall short of you.
Surely I would speak to the Almighty, and I desire to argue my case before God.
But you are imputers of lies; you are all worthless healers.
Oh that you would stop speaking entirely! And it would be your wisdom.
Hear now my reasoning, and listen to the pleadings of my lips.
Would you speak unrighteously for God, and talk deceitfully for Him?
Will you lift up His person, or contend for God?
Is it good that He should search you out? Or as one man mocks another, do you mock Him?
He will surely blame you, if you secretly lift up persons.
Shall not His highness make you afraid, and His dread fall on you?
Your remembered sayings are like ashes, your bodies like bodies of clay.
Be quiet. Let me alone so that I may speak, and let come on me what may.
Why do I take my flesh in my teeth and put my life in my hand?
Though he slay me, I will not wait, but I will maintain my own ways before Him.
He also is my salvation, for an ungodly one shall not come before Him.
Listen carefully to my words, and let what I say be in your ears.
Behold now, I have set my cause in order; I know that I shall be justified.
Who is he that will plead for me, for now, I would be quiet and expire.
Only do not do two things to me; then I will not hide myself from You.
Withdraw Your hand far from me, and let not Your fear make me afraid.
Then call, and I will answer; or let me speak, and answer You me.
How many are my iniquities and sins? Make known my transgressions and my sin.
Why do You hide Your face, and hold me for Your enemy?
Will You terrify a leaf driven to and fro? Will You pursue the dry stubble?
For You write bitter things against me, and make me to possess the sins of my youth.
You put my feet also in the stocks, and look closely to all my paths; You set a limit for the soles of my feet.
And he wears out like a rotten thing, like a garment that a moth eats.

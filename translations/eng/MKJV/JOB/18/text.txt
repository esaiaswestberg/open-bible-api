And Bildad the Shuhite answered and said,
Until when will you set a snare for words? Understand, and afterwards we will speak.
Why are we counted as cattle, or seem stupid in your sight?
He tears himself in his anger; shall the earth be forsaken for you? And shall the rock be moved out of its place?
Yes, the light of the wicked shall be put out, and the spark of his fire shall not shine.
The light shall be dark in his tent, and his lamp shall be put out with him.
The steps of his strength shall be hampered, and his own plans shall throw him down.
For he is thrown into a net by his own feet, and he walks on a net.
The trap shall take him by the heel, and the noose shall hold sway over him.
The pitfall is laid for him in the ground, and a trap for him in the way.
Terrors shall make him afraid on every side, and shall dash him at his feet.
His strength shall be hunger-bitten, and trouble shall be ready at his side.
It shall devour the parts of his skin; the first-born of death consumes his parts.
His hope shall be rooted out of his tent, and you marched to the king of terrors.
What is not his shall dwell in his tent; brimstone shall be scattered on his home.
His roots shall be dried up beneath, and his branch shall wither above.
His memory shall perish from the earth, and there is no name to him on the face of the street.
They drive him from light to darkness, and they make him flee from the world.
He shall have neither son nor kinsman among his people, nor any remaining in his dwellings.
Those after him shall be amazed at his day; and those before were seized with horror.
Surely these are the dwellings of the perverse, and this the place that has not known God.

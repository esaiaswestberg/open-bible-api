To the Chief Musician. On stringed instruments. A Psalm. A Song. May God be merciful to us, and bless us, and cause His face to shine on us. Selah.
So that Your way may be known on earth, Your salvation among all nations.
Let the peoples praise You, O God; let all the peoples thank You.
O let the nations be glad and sing for joy; for You shall judge the peoples righteously and govern the nations on earth. Selah.
Let the peoples give thanks to You, O God; let all the peoples praise You.
The earth shall yield its increase; and God, our own God, shall bless us.
God shall bless us; and all the ends of the earth shall fear Him.

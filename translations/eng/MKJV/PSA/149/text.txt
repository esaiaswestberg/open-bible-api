Praise the LORD! Sing to the LORD a new song, His praise in the congregation of saints.
Let Israel rejoice in his Makers; let the sons of Zion be joyful in their Kings.
Let them praise His name in the dance; let them sing praises to Him with the timbrel and harp.
For the LORD takes pleasure in His people; He will beautify the meek with salvation.
Let the saints be joyful in glory; let them sing aloud on their beds.
Let the high praises of God be in their mouth, and a two-edged sword in their hand,
to carry out vengeance on the nations and punishments on the peoples,
to bind their kings with chains and their nobles with iron-bands,
to carry out on them the judgment written; this is an honor for all His saints. Praise the LORD!

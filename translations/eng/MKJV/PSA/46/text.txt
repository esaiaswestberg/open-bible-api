To the Chief Musician. For the sons of Korah. A Song "For the Virgins." God is our refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble.
Therefore we will not fear when the earth changes, and when mountains are slipping into the heart of the seas.
Let its waters roar and foam; let the mountains shake with the swelling of it. Selah.
There is a river, its channels gladden the city of God glad, the holy place of the tabernacles of the Most High.
God is in the midst of her; she shall not be moved; God shall help her at the turning of the morning.
The nations raged, the kingdoms were shaken; He uttered His voice, the earth melted.
The LORD of hosts is with us; the God of Jacob is our refuge. Selah.
Come, behold the works of the LORD, who makes ruins on the earth;
who makes wars to cease to the ends of the earth; He breaks the bow, and cuts the spear in two; He burns the chariots in the fire.
Be still, and know that I am God! I will be praised among the nations, I will be praised in the earth.
The LORD of hosts is with us; the God of Jacob is our refuge. Selah.

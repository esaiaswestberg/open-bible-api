There we sat down by the rivers of Babylon; also, we wept when we remembered Zion.
We hung our lyres on the willows in its midst.
For there our captors demanded a song from us; and our plunderers demanded gladness, saying, Sing us one of the songs of Zion.
How shall we sing the LORD's song in a foreign land?
If I forget you, O Jerusalem, let my right hand forget.
If I do not remember you, let my tongue cling to the roof of my mouth; if I do not prefer Jerusalem above my chief joy.
Remember, O LORD, the sons of Edom in the day of Jerusalem; who said, Make it bare! Make it bare, even to the foundation of it!
O daughter of Babylon, O destroyed one! Blessed is he who will repay to you your reward which you rewarded to us.
Blessed is he who seizes and dashes your little ones against the stones.

To the Chief Musician. To Jeduthun. A Psalm of David. Only to God is my soul in silence; from Him comes my salvation.
He only is my rock and my salvation; He is my tower; I shall not be greatly moved.
How long will you imagine mischief against a man? You will shatter him, all of you; you shall be like a bowing wall and a tottering fence.
Surely they have plotted to cast him down from his great height; they delight in lies; they bless with their mouth, but they curse in their heart. Selah.
My soul, be silent only to God; for my hope is from Him.
He only is my rock and my salvation; He is my strong tower; I shall not be shaken.
In God is my salvation and my glory; the rock of my strength; my hiding-place is in God.
Trust in Him at all times; you people, pour out your heart before Him; God is a hiding-place for us. Selah.
Surely the sons of men are vanity; the sons of men are a lie; they go up in the scales; they are altogether lighter than vanity.
Trust not in oppression, and become not vain in robbery; if riches increase, do not set your heart on them.
God has spoken once; twice I have heard this, that power belongs to God.
Also to You, O LORD, belongs mercy; for You give to every man according to his work.

A Psalm of David. I will sing of mercy and judgment; to You, O LORD, I will sing praise.
I will behave myself wisely in a perfect way. O when will You come to me? I will walk within my house with a perfect heart.
I will set no wicked thing before my eyes. I have hated the work of those who turn aside; it shall not hold on to me.
A perverse heart will depart from me; I will not know the wicked.
Whoever secretly slanders his neighbor, I will cut him off; him who has a high look and a proud heart, I will not allow.
My eyes shall be on the faithful of the land, so that they may dwell with me; he who walks in a perfect way, he shall serve Me.
He who works falsely shall not dwell within my house; he who tells lies shall not stay in my sight.
I will early destroy all the wicked of the land, so that I may cut off all wicked doers from the city of the LORD.

A Psalm of David. Bless the LORD, O my soul; and all that is within me, bless His holy name.
Bless the LORD, O my soul, and forget not all His benefits;
who forgives all your iniquities; who heals all your diseases;
who redeems your life from ruin; who crowns you with loving-kindness and tender mercies;
who satisfies your mouth with good; your youth is renewed like the eagle's.
The LORD works righteousness and judgment for all who are pressed down.
He made known His ways to Moses, His acts to the sons of Israel.
The LORD is merciful and gracious, slow to anger, and rich in mercy.
He will not always chasten, nor will He keep His anger forever.
He has not dealt with us according to our sins, nor rewarded us according to our iniquities.
For as the heavens are high above the earth, so is His mercy toward those who fear Him.
As far as the east is from the west, so far has He removed our transgressions from us.
As a father pities his children, the LORD pities those who fear Him.
For He knows our form; He remembers that we are dust.
As for man, his days are as grass; as a flower of the field, so he flourishes.
For the wind passes over it, and it is gone; and its place shall know it no more.
But the mercy of the LORD is from everlasting to everlasting on those who fear Him, and His righteousness is to sons of sons;
to those who keep His covenant, and to those who remember to do His commandments.
The LORD has prepared His throne in the heavens; and His kingdom rules over all.
Bless the LORD, O angels of His, who excel in strength, who do His command, listening to the voice of His word.
Bless the LORD, all His hosts, ministers of His who do His pleasure.
Bless the LORD, all His works in all places of His rule; bless the LORD, O my soul.

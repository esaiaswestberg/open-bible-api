A Song, A Psalm of David. O God, my heart is fixed; I will sing and I will give praise, even with my glory.
Awake, harp and lyre; I will awake early.
I will praise You, O LORD, among the peoples; and I will sing praises to You among the nations.
For Your mercy is great above the heavens; and Your truth reaches to the clouds.
Be lifted up, O God, above the heavens; and Your glory above all the earth;
so that Your beloved may be delivered; save with Your right hand, and answer me.
God has spoken in His holiness; I will rejoice, I will divide Shechem, and I will measure out the valley of Succoth.
Gilead is Mine; Manasseh is Mine and Ephraim is the strength of My head; Judah is My lawgiver;
Moab is My washpot; I will cast out My shoe over Edom; I will triumph over Philistia.
Who will bring me into the strong city? Who will lead me into Edom?
O God, have You not cast us off? And, O God, will You not go out with our armies?
Give us help from trouble; for vain is the deliverance of man.
Through God we shall do mighty things; for He shall trample our enemies.

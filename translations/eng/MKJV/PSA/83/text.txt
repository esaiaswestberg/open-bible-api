A Song. A Psalm of Asaph. Keep not silence, O God; do not be speechless, and be not still, O God.
For lo, Your enemies roar; and those who hate You have lifted up their head.
They take shrewd counsel against Your people, and plot against Your hidden ones.
They have said, Come, and let us cut them off from being a nation, so that the name Israel may be remembered no more.
For with one heart they have plotted together; they have made a covenant against You--
the tents of Edom, and the Ishmaelites; of Moab, and the Hagarites;
Gebal, and Ammon, and Amalek; the Philistines with the people of Tyre;
and Assyria has joined with them; they have helped the sons of Lot. Selah.
Do to them as to Midian, as to Sisera, as to Jabin at the torrent Kishon;
who perished at Endor; they became as dung for the earth.
Make their nobles like Oreb, and like Zeeb; yea, all their princes like Zebah, and like Zalmunna;
who said, Let us take possession for ourselves of the houses of God.
O my God, make them like a wheel; like the stubble before the wind.
As the fire burns a forest, and as the flame sets the mountains on fire,
so pursue them with Your tempest, and make them afraid with Your storm.
Fill their faces with shame, that they may seek Your name, O LORD.
Let them be ashamed and troubled forever; yea, let them be put to shame, and lost;
so that men may know that Your name is JEHOVAH, that You alone are the Most High over all the earth.

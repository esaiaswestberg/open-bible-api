Praise the LORD; for it is good to sing praises to our God; for praise is delightful and becoming.
The LORD builds up Jerusalem; He gathers together the outcasts of Israel.
He heals the broken-hearted, and binds up their wounds.
He appoints the number of the stars; He calls them all by their names.
Great is our LORD, and of great power; There is no limit to His understanding.
The LORD lifts up the meek; He throws the wicked down to the ground.
Sing to the LORD with thanksgiving; sing praise on the harp to our God,
who covers the heavens with clouds, who prepares rain for the earth, who makes grass to grow on the mountains.
He gives the beasts its food, and to the young ravens which cry.
He delights not in the strength of the horse; He takes no pleasure in the legs of a man.
The LORD takes pleasure in those who fear Him, who hope in His mercy.
Praise the LORD, O Jerusalem; praise your God, O Zion.
For He has made the bars of your gates strong; He has blessed your sons within you.
He makes peace in your borders and fills you with the finest of the wheat.
He sends forth His commandment on earth; His word runs very swiftly.
He gives snow like wool; He scatters the hoarfrost like ashes.
He casts forth His ice like crumbs; who can stand before His cold?
He sends out His word and melts them; He causes His wind to blow, and the waters flow.
He shows His word to Jacob, His statutes and His judgments to Israel.
He has not done so with any nation; and they have not known His judgments. Praise the LORD!

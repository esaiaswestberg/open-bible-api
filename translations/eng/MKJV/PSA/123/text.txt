A Song of degrees. To You I lift up my eyes, O Dweller in Heaven.
Behold, as the eyes of servants look to the hand of their masters; as the eyes of a maiden to the hand of her mistress; so our eyes wait on the LORD our God, until He shall have mercy on us.
Have mercy on us, O LORD, have mercy on us; for we are exceedingly filled with scorn.
Our soul is exceedingly filled with the contempt of those who are at ease, with the scorn of the proud.

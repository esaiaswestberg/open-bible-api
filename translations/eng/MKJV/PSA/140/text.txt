To the Chief Musician, A Psalm of David. Deliver me, O LORD, from the evil man; keep me from the violent man,
who devised evil things in the heart; they are always gathered for war.
They have sharpened their tongues like a serpent; adders' poison is under their lips. Selah.
O LORD, keep me from the hands of the wicked; keep me from the violent man who purposed to trip up my steps.
The proud have hidden cords and a trap for me; they have spread a net by the wayside; they have set snares for me. Selah.
I said to the LORD, You are my God; O LORD, hear the voice of my prayers.
O Lord Jehovah, the strength of my salvation, You have covered my head in the day of battle.
O LORD, do not grant the desires of the wicked; do not help his wicked plans, lest they praise themselves. Selah.
As for the head of those around me, let the evil of their own lips cover them.
Let burning coals fall on them; let them be cast into the fire; into deep pits, so that they do not rise up again.
Do not let an evil speaker be established in the earth; evil shall hunt the violent man to overthrow him.
I know that the LORD will maintain the cause of the afflicted and the right of the poor.
Surely the righteous shall give thanks to Your name; the upright shall dwell in Your presence.

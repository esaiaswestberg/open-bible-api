A Psalm of David, when he changed his behavior before Abimelech; who drove him away, and he departed. I will bless the LORD at all times; His praise always shall be in my mouth.
My soul shall make its boast in the LORD; the humble shall hear and be glad.
O magnify the LORD with me, and let us exalt His name together.
I sought the LORD, and He heard me, and delivered me from all my fears.
They looked to Him, and were filled with light; and their faces were not ashamed.
This poor man cried, and the LORD heard, and saved him out of all his troubles.
The Angel of the LORD camps round about those who fear Him, and delivers them.
Taste and see that the LORD is good; blessed is the man who trusts in Him.
O fear the LORD, His holy ones; for there is nothing lacking to those who fear Him.
The young lions lack, and suffer hunger; but those who seek the LORD shall not lack any good thing.
Come, listen to me, my sons; I will teach you the fear of the LORD.
Who is the man that desires life, and loves days, that he may see good?
Keep your tongue from evil and your lips from speaking guile.
Depart from evil and do good; seek peace and pursue it.
The eyes of the LORD are on the righteous, and His ears are open to their cry.
The face of the LORD is against those who do evil, to cut off the memory of them from the earth.
The righteous cry, and the LORD hears, and delivers them out of all their troubles.
The LORD is near to the broken-hearted; and saves those who are of a contrite spirit.
Many are the afflictions of the righteous, but the LORD delivers him out of them all.
He keeps all his bones; not one of them is broken.
Evil shall slay the wicked; and those who hate the righteous shall be held guilty.
The LORD redeems the soul of His servants; and none of them who trust in Him shall be guilty.

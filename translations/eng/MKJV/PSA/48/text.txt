A Song and Psalm for the Sons of Korah. Great is the LORD, and greatly to be praised in the city of our God, in the mountain of His holiness.
Beautiful on high, the joy of the whole earth, is mount Zion, on the sides of the north, the city of the great King.
God is known in her strongholds for a refuge.
For, lo, the kings were gathered; they passed by together.
They saw, so they marvelled; they were troubled, and hurried away.
Fear took hold on them there, and pain, like a woman in labor.
You break the ships of Tarshish with an east wind;
as we have heard, so we have seen in the city of the LORD of hosts, in the city of our God. God will establish it forever. Selah.
We have thought of Your loving-kindness, O God, in the midst of Your temple.
According to Your name, O God, so is Your praise to the ends of the earth. Your right hand is full of righteousness; let mount Zion rejoice!
Let the daughters of Judah shout for joy because of Your judgments!
Walk around Zion, and go all around it; count the towers of it,
Set your heart on its ramparts, pass between its strongholds; so that you may tell it to the coming generation.
For this God is our God forever and ever; He will be our guide even to death.

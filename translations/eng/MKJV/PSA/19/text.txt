To the Chief Musician. A Psalm of David. The heavens declare the glory of God; and the expanse proclaims His handiwork.
Day by day they pour forth speech, and night to night reveals knowledge.
There is no speech nor are there words where their voice is not heard.
Their line has gone out through all the earth and their words to the end of the world. In them He has set a tabernacle for the sun,
and he comes forth as a bridegroom from his canopy; he rejoices as a strong man to run a race,
going forth from the end of the heavens, and its course is to their ends. And there is nothing hid from its heat.
The law of the LORD is perfect, converting the soul; the testimony of the LORD is sure, making the simple wise.
The statutes of the LORD are right, rejoicing the heart; the commandments of the LORD are pure, giving light to the eyes.
The fear of the LORD is clean, enduring forever; the judgments of the LORD are true and righteous altogether,
more to be desired than gold, even much fine gold; sweeter also than honey and the honeycomb.
And Your servant is warned by them; in keeping them there is great reward.
Who can understand his errors? Oh make me pure from secret faults;
and keep Your servant back from presumptuous sins; do not let them rule over me; then I shall be upright, and I shall be innocent of great transgression.
Let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be pleasing in Your sight, O LORD, my Rock and my Redeemer.

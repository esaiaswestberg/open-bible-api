To the Chief Musician. A Psalm of David. The king shall rejoice in Your strength, O LORD; and in Your salvation how greatly shall he rejoice!
You have given him his heart's desire, and have not withheld the prayer of his lips. Selah.
For You go before him with the blessings of goodness; You set a crown of pure gold on his head.
He asked life from You; You give to him length of days forever and ever.
His glory is great in Your salvation; honor and majesty You have laid on him.
For You have made him most blessed forever; You have rejoiced him in the gladness in Your holy face.
For the king trusts in the LORD, and in the mercy of the Most High; he shall not be moved.
Your hand shall find out all Your enemies; Your right hand shall find out those who hate You.
You shall make them as a fiery oven in the time of Your presence; the LORD will swallow them up in His wrath, and the fire shall devour them.
Their fruit shall You destroy from the earth, and their seed from among the sons of men.
For they intended evil against You; they imagined a wicked thing; they are not able to prevail.
For You shall make them turn the back; You shall make ready Your arrows on Your strings against their faces.
Be exalted, O LORD, in Your strength; we will sing, and praise Your power.

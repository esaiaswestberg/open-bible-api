To the Chief Musician. A Psalm of David. Hear my voice, O God, in my complaint; guard my life from fear of the enemy.
Hide me from the council of those who injure, from the rebelling of the workers of iniquity,
who sharpen their tongue like a sword, they tread their arrows, even a bitter word,
so that they may shoot at the blameless one from a lurking place; suddenly they shoot at him, and fear not.
They encourage themselves in an evil plan; they talk of laying snares secretly; they say, Who shall see them?
They search out injustice, saying, We have finished hiding a hidden plot. Yea, the inward part of man and the heart are deep.
But God shall shoot at them with an arrow; suddenly they shall be wounded.
So they shall be confounded; their tongue falls on themselves; everyone seeing them shall flee.
And all men shall fear, and shall declare the work of God; for they shall in wisdom think of His doing.
The righteous shall be glad in the LORD, and shall trust in Him; and all the upright in heart shall glory.

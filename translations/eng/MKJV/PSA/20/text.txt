To the Chief Musician. A Psalm of David. May the LORD hear you in the day of trouble, the name of the God of Jacob set you on high,
sending you help from the sanctuary, and upholding you out of Zion.
He will remember all your offerings, and accept your burnt sacrifice. Selah.
May He grant you according to your own heart, and fulfill all your plans.
We will rejoice in your salvation, and in the name of our God we will set up banners; may the LORD fulfill all your prayers.
Now I know that the LORD saves His anointed; He will hear him from His holy Heaven with the saving strengths of His right hand.
Some trust in chariots, and some in horses; but we will remember the name of the LORD our God.
They have bowed down and fallen; but we have risen and stand upright.
Save, O LORD; let the King hear us when we call.

To the Chief Musician. On stringed instruments. A Psalm of David. Hear my cry, O God; attend to my prayer.
From the end of the earth I cry to You when my heart is faint; Lead me to the Rock higher than I.
For You have been a shelter for me, a strong tower before the enemy.
I will dwell in Your tabernacle forever; I will trust in the hiding place of Your wings. Selah.
For You, O God, have heard my vows; You have given an inheritance to those who fear Your name.
You will add to the days of the king's life; his years will be for many generations.
He shall abide before God forever; prepare mercy and truth to preserve him.
So I will sing praise to Your name forever, so that I may daily pay my vows.

To the Chief Musician. Concerning the silent dove-- those far off. Of David, a secret treasure--when the Philistines took him in Gath. Be merciful to me, O God, for man would swallow me up; fighting daily, he presses me down.
My watchers panted for me daily; for many are they who proudly fight against me.
When I am afraid I will trust in You.
In God I will praise His word; in God I have put my trust; I will not fear what flesh can do to me.
All day long they pervert my words; all their thoughts are against me for evil.
They stir up strife; they hide themselves; they watch my steps as they wait for my soul.
Shall they escape by iniquity? In anger cast down the peoples, O God.
You number my wandering; O put my tears into Your bottle; are they not in Your Book?
When I cry, then my enemies will be turned back. This I know, for God is with me.
In God I will praise His word; in the LORD will I praise His word.
In God I have put my trust; I will not be afraid of what man can do to me.
Your vows are on me, O God; I will give praises to You.
For You have delivered my soul from death; have You not kept my feet from falling, so that I may walk before God in the light of the living?

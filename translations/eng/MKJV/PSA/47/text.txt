To the Chief Musician. A Psalm for the sons of Korah. Clap your hand, all you peoples; shout to God with the voice of triumph.
For the LORD Most High is awesome, a great king over all the earth.
He shall humble the peoples under us, and nations under our feet.
He shall choose our inheritance for us, the majesty of Jacob whom He loved. Selah.
God has gone up with a shout, the LORD with the sound of a trumpet.
Sing praise to God, sing praise; sing praise to our King, sing praise.
For God is King of all the earth; sing praises with understanding.
God reigns over the nations, God sits on the throne of His holiness.
The rulers of the peoples are gathered together, the people of the God of Abraham; for the shields of the earth are God's; He is lifted up on high.

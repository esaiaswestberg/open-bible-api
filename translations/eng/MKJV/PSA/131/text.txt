A Song of degrees; of David. O LORD, my heart is not proud, nor my eyes lofty; nor have I walked in great things, nor in things too wondrous for me.
Surely I have behaved and have quieted my soul, as one weaned by its mother; my soul on me is like one weaned.
Let Israel hope in the LORD from this moment and forever.

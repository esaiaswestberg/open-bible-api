To the Chief Musician. To Jeduthun. A Psalm of Asaph. I cried to God with my voice, to God is my voice; and He gave ear to me.
In the day of my trouble I sought the LORD; my hand was poured in the night, and ceased not; my soul refused to be comforted.
I remembered God, and was troubled; I complained, and my spirit fainted. Selah.
You keep my eyes awake; I am troubled and I cannot speak.
I have thought on the days of old, the years of ages past.
I remember my song in the night; I speak with my own heart, and my spirit carefully searches.
Will the Lord cast off forever? And will He be favorable no more?
Is His mercy gone forever? Has His word failed for all generations?
Has God forgotten to be gracious? Has He in anger shut up His tender mercies? Selah.
And I said, This is my weakness, the years of the right hand of the Most High.
I will remember the works of the LORD; surely I will remember Your wonders of old.
I will also think on all Your work, and talk of Your doings.
Your way, O God, is in holiness; who is so great a God as our God?
You are the God who does wonders; You have declared Your strength among the people.
You have with Your arm redeemed Your people, the sons of Jacob and Joseph. Selah.
The waters saw You, O God, the waters saw You; they were afraid; the depths also were troubled.
The clouds poured out water; the skies sent out a sound; Your arrows also flew here and there.
The voice of Your thunder was in the sky; the lightnings lit up the world; the earth trembled and shook.
Your way is in the sea, and Your path in the great waters, and Your footsteps are not known.
You led Your people like a flock by the hand of Moses and Aaron.

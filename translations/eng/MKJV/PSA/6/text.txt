To the Chief Musician, for eight-stringed instruments. A Psalm of David. O LORD, rebuke me not in Your anger, nor chasten me in the heat of Your fury.
Have mercy on me, O LORD, for I am weak; O LORD, heal me, for my bones are troubled.
My soul also is exceedingly troubled; but You, O LORD, how long?
Return, O LORD, return; deliver my soul; save me for Your mercy's sake.
For in death there is no memory of You; in the grave who shall give You thanks?
I am weary in my groaning; all the night I make my bed swim; I melt my couch with my tears.
My eye is dim because of grief; it wastes away because of all my enemies.
Depart from me, all workers of iniquity; for the LORD has heard the voice of my weeping.
The LORD has heard my cry; the LORD will receive my prayer.
Let all my enemies be ashamed and exceedingly troubled; let them turn back and be ashamed in a moment.

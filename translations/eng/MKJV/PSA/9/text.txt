To the Chief Musician. To die for the Son. A Psalm of David. I will praise You, O LORD, with my whole heart; I will tell of all Your marvelous works.
I will be glad and rejoice in You; I will sing praise to Your name, O Most High.
When my enemies have turned back, they shall fall and perish before You.
For You have maintained my right and my cause; You sat in the throne judging right.
You have rebuked the heathen, You have destroyed the wicked, You have put out their name forever and ever.
The desolations of the enemy have come to an end forever, and You have destroyed the cities; their memorial has perished with them.
But the LORD shall endure forever; He has prepared His throne for judgment.
And He shall judge the world in righteousness; He shall judge the peoples in uprightness.
The LORD also will be a refuge for the oppressed, a refuge in times of trouble.
And those who know Your name will put their trust in You; for You, LORD, have not forsaken those who seek You.
Sing praises to the LORD, who dwells in Zion; declare among the nations His deeds.
For He remembers them, the seekers of bloodshed; He forgets not the cry of the humble.
Have mercy on me, O LORD; see my trouble from those who hate me, You who lift me up from the gates of death,
so that I may declare all Your praise in the gates of the daughter of Zion; I will rejoice in Your salvation.
The nations have sunk down in the pit that they made; their foot is caught in the net which they hid.
The LORD is known. He has executed judgment; the wicked is snared in the work of his own hands. A meditation. Selah.
The wicked shall be turned into hell, all the nations that forget God.
For the needy shall not always be forgotten; the hope of the poor shall not perish forever.
Arise, O LORD; let not man be strong. Let the nations be judged in Your sight.
Put them in fear, O LORD, let the nations know they are but men. Selah.

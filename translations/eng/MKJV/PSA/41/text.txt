To the Chief Musician. A Psalm of David. Blessed is he who acts wisely toward the poor; the LORD will deliver him in time of trouble.
The LORD will watch over him and keep him alive; and he shall be blessed on the earth; and You will not deliver him to the soul of his enemies.
The LORD will hold him up on the bed of sickness; You will change all his bed in his illness.
I said, LORD, be merciful to me; heal my soul; for I have sinned against You.
My enemies speak evil of me, saying, When will he die, and his name perish?
And when he comes to see me, he speaks vanity; his heart gathers iniquity to itself; he goes out and speaks of it.
All my haters me whisper against me; they plot evil against me.
They say, a wicked thing is poured out on him, and he who lies down shall rise no more.
Even a man, my friend, in whom I trusted, who ate of my bread, has lifted up his heel against me.
But You, O LORD, be merciful to me, and raise me up, so that I may repay them.
By this I know that You delight in me, because my enemy does not triumph over me.
And I, in my integrity You uphold me; and You set me before Your face forever.
Blessed is the LORD God of Israel, from everlasting, and to everlasting. Amen and Amen!

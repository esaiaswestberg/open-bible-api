Oh come, let us sing to the LORD; let us make a joyful noise to the Rock of our salvation.
Let us come before His presence with thanksgiving, and make a joyful noise to Him with psalms.
For the LORD is a great God, and a great King above all gods.
In His hand are the deep places of the earth; the strength of the hills is also His.
The sea is His, and He made it, and His hands formed the dry land.
Oh come, let us worship and bow down; let us kneel before the LORD our maker.
For He is our God, and we are the people of His pasture, and the sheep of His hand. Today if you will hear His voice,
harden not your heart, as in the day of strife, as in the day of testing in the wilderness;
when your fathers tempted Me, tested Me, and saw My work.
For forty years I was grieved with this generation, and said, It is a people who go astray in their hearts, and they have not known My ways;
to whom I swore in My wrath that they should not enter into My rest.

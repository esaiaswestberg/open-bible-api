To the Chief Musician. On Gittith, A Psalm of Asaph. Sing aloud to God our strength; shout for joy to the God of Jacob.
Lift up a psalm, and bring the timbrel here, the pleasing lyre and harp.
Blow the ram's horn in the new moon, in the time appointed, on our solemn feast day.
For this was a statute for Israel, an ordinance of the God of Jacob.
This He ordained in Joseph for a testimony, when He went out over the land of Egypt; I heard a language I understood not.
I removed his shoulder from the burden; his hands were delivered from the pots.
You called in trouble, and I delivered you; I answered you in the secret place of thunder; I tested you at the waters of Meribah. Selah.
Hear, O My people, and I will testify to you; O Israel, if you will listen to Me,
there shall be no strange god in you; nor shall you worship any strange god.
I am the LORD your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt; open your mouth wide, and I will fill it.
But My people would not listen to My voice, and Israel would have none of Me.
So I gave them up to the stubbornness of their own hearts; and they walked in their own conceits.
Oh that My people had listened to Me, and Israel had walked in My ways!
I would soon have humbled their enemies, and would have turned My hand against their foes.
The haters of the LORD would have been found liars to Him, and their time would have lasted forever.
And He would have fed them also with the finest of the wheat; and with honey out of the rock I would have satisfied you.

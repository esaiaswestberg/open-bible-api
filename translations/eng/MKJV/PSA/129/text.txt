A Song of degrees. Many times they have afflicted me from my youth, Israel may now say;
many times they have afflicted me from my youth; yet they have not prevailed over me.
The plowers plowed on my back; they made their furrows long.
The LORD is righteous; He cuts off the cords of the wicked.
Let them all be ashamed and turned back, those who hate Zion.
Let them be like the grass on the housetops, which dries up before it grows up,
with which the reaper does not fill his hand, nor the binder of sheaves his bosom.
And those who pass by have never said, The blessing of the LORD be on you; we bless you in the name of the LORD.

To the Chief Musician. A Song. A Psalm. Make a joyful noise to God, all the earth.
Sing forth the honor of His name; make His praise glorious.
Say to God, How awesome are Your works! Through the greatness of Your power, Your enemies pretend obedience to You.
All the earth shall worship You, and shall sing to You; they praise Your name. Selah.
Come and see the works of God; He is awesome in His deeds toward the sons of men.
He turns the sea into dry land; they went through the flood on foot; there we rejoiced in Him.
He rules by His power forever; His eyes behold the nations; let not the rebels lift themselves up. Selah.
O bless our God, O peoples, and make the voice of His praise to be heard;
who holds our soul in life, and does not allow our feet to slide.
For You have proved us, O God; You have tested us, as silver is refined.
You have brought us into the net; You have laid affliction on our loins.
You have allowed men to ride at our head; we have gone through fire and through water, but You have brought us out to plenty.
I will go into Your house with burnt offerings; I will pay You my vows,
those which my lips have uttered and my mouth has spoken in my trouble.
I will offer to You burnt sacrifices of fatlings, with the incense of rams; I will offer bulls with goats. Selah.
Come and hear, all you who fear God, and I will declare what He has done for my soul.
I cried to Him with my mouth, and exaltations were under my tongue.
If I regard iniquity in my heart, the LORD will not hear;
Surely God has heard; He has attended to the voice of my prayer.
Blessed is God, who has not turned away my prayer, nor His mercy from me.

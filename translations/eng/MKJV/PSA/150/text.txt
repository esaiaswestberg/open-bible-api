Praise the LORD. Praise God in His sanctuary; praise Him in the expanse of His power.
Praise Him for His mighty acts; praise Him according to His excellent greatness.
Praise Him with the sound of the trumpet; praise Him with the harp and lyre.
Praise Him with the timbrel and dance; praise Him with stringed instruments and pipes.
Praise Him on the sounding cymbals; praise Him with the resounding cymbals.
Let everything that breathes praise the LORD. Praise the LORD!

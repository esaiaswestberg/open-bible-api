To the Chief Musician. Do not destroy. A Psalm of Asaph. A Song. To You, O God, we have given thanks, to You we have given thanks; for Your name is near, Your wonderful works declared.
When I take the appointed time, I will judge uprightly.
The earth and all its people are melting away; I hold up its pillars. Selah.
I said to the proud, Do not boast; and to the wicked, Do not lift up the horn;
do not lift up your horn on high; nor speak with a stiff neck.
For lifting up comes neither from the east, nor from the west, nor from the south.
But God is the judge; He puts down one and sets up another.
For in the hand of the LORD there is a cup, and the wine is red; it is fully mixed; and He pours out from it; but the dregs of it, all the wicked of the earth shall drain its dregs and drink.
But I will declare forever; I will sing praises to the God of Jacob.
Also I will cut off all the horns of the wicked; but the horns of the righteous shall be lifted up.

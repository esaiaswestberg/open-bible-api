Praise the LORD! Praise, O servants of the LORD, praise the name of the LORD.
Blessed is the name of the LORD from this time forth and forevermore.
From the rising of the sun to its going down, the LORD's name is to be praised.
The LORD is high above all nations, and His glory above the heavens.
Who is like the LORD our God, who dwells on high,
who humbles Himself to behold the things in the heavens and in the earth!
He raises up the poor out of the dust, and lifts the needy out of the dunghill,
in order to make him sit with nobles, with the nobles of his people.
He causes the barren to dwell in the house as a joyful mother of sons. Praise the LORD!

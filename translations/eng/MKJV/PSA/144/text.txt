A Psalm of David. Blessed is the LORD my Rock, who teaches My hands for war, my fingers for battle.
He is my goodness and my fortress; my high tower and my deliverer; my shield and He in whom I trust; who humbles my people under me.
O LORD, what is man that You take knowledge of him! Or the son of man, that You esteem him?
Man is like vanity; his days are like a shadow that passes away.
Bow down Your heavens, O LORD, and come down; touch the mountains, and they shall smoke.
Cast forth lightning and scatter them; shoot out Your arrows and destroy them.
Send Your hand from above; rescue me, and deliver me out of great waters, from the hand of a foreigner's sons;
because their mouth has spoken vanity, and their right hand is a right hand of lies.
I will sing a new song to You, O God; on a harp of ten strings I will sing praises to You.
It is You who gives salvation to kings; who delivers David His servant from the hurtful sword.
Rescue me, and deliver me from the hand of foreigners' sons, because their mouth has spoken vanity, and their right hand is a right hand of falsehood;
so that our sons may be like plants grown up in their youth; and our daughters may be like corner-stones, polished like a palace building;
and our storehouses may be full, furnishing kind to kind; and our flocks may breed thousands and ten thousands outside;
and our oxen may be loaded; there is no break in nor going out and no crying in our streets.
Blessed are the peoples who are so; blessed are the peoples to whom Jehovah is his God.

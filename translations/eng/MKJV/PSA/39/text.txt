To the Chief Musician, to Jeduthun. A Psalm of David. I said, I will take heed to my ways so that I do not sin with my tongue; I will keep my mouth with a bridle while the wicked are before me.
I became dumb, keeping still; I was silent, from good; and my pain was stirred.
My heart was hot within me; while I was musing, the fire burned; I spoke with my tongue:
O LORD, make me to know my end, and the measure of my days, what it is; I know how frail I am.
Behold, You have made my days as a handbreadth, and my age is as nothing before You. Surely every man standing is altogether vanity. Selah.
Surely a man walks about like a shadow! Surely they are in an uproar in vain. He heaps up, and does not know who shall gather them.
And now, Lord, what do I wait for? My hope is in You.
Deliver me from all my transgressions; make me not the reproach of the fool.
I was dumb, I did not open my mouth; because You have done it.
Remove Your stroke away from me; I am destroyed by the blow of Your hand.
You correct a man for iniquity with rebukes, and you make his desires vanish away like a moth. Surely every man is vanity. Selah.
Hear my prayer, O LORD, and give ear to my cry. Do not be silent at my tears; for I am a stranger with You, a pilgrim, as all my fathers were.
Look away from me, and I will smile before I go away and be no more.

But the Spirit expressly says that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits and teachings of demons,
speaking lies in hypocrisy, being seared in their own conscience,
forbidding to marry, saying to abstain from foods which God has created to be received with thanksgiving by those who believe and know the truth.
For every creation of God is good, and nothing to be refused if it is received with thanksgiving.
For it is sanctified through the Word of God and prayer.
Having suggested these things to the brothers, you shall be a good minister of Jesus Christ, nourished up in the words of faith and by the good doctrine which you have followed.
But refuse profane and old-womanish tales, and exercise yourself to godliness.
For bodily exercise profits a little, but godliness is profitable to all things, having promise of the present life, and of that which is to come.
Faithful is the Word, and worthy of all acceptance.
For to this we both labor and suffer reproach, because we trust in the living God, who is the preserver of all men, especially of those who believe.
Command and teach these things.
Let no one despise your youth, but be an example of the believers, in word, in conduct, in love, in spirit, in faith, in purity.
Until I come, attend to reading, to exhortation, to teaching.
Do not neglect the gift in you, which was given you by prophecy, with the laying on of the hands of the body of elders.
Meditate on these things; be in these things in order that your improvement may appear to all.
Hold on to yourself and to the doctrine; continue in them, for doing this you shall both save yourself and those who hear you.

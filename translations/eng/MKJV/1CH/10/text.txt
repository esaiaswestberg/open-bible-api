And the Philistines fought with Israel. And the men of Israel fled from the face of the Philistines, and fell down dead in Mount Gilboa.
And the Philistines followed hard after Saul and after his sons. And the Philistines killed Jonathan and Abinadab, and Malchishua, the sons of Saul.
And the battle went sorely against Saul. And the archers hit him, and he was wounded by the archers.
And Saul said to his armor-bearer, Draw your sword and pierce me with it, lest these uncircumcised ones come and abuse me. But his armor-bearer would not, for he was very much afraid. So Saul took a sword and fell on it.
And his armor-bearer saw that Saul was dead, and he also fell on the sword and died.
And Saul and his three sons died, and all his house died together.
And all the men of Israel in the valley saw that they fled, and that Saul and his sons had died. And they left their cities and fled. And the Philistines came and lived in them.
And it happened on the next day, when the Philistines came to strip the dead, and they found Saul and his sons fallen in Mount Gilboa.
And they stripped him, and carried his head and his armor, and sent into the land of the Philistines all around, to carry news to their idols and to the people.
And they put his armor in the house of their gods, and fastened his skull in the temple of Dagon.
And all Jabesh-gilead heard all that the Philistines had done to Saul.
And all the mighty men arose and took away the body of Saul, and the bodies of his sons, and brought them to Jabesh. And they buried their bones under the oak in Jabesh, and fasted seven days.
And Saul died for his sin which he committed against the LORD, against the word of the LORD, which he did not keep, and also for seeking of a medium, to inquire, and
inquired not of the LORD. And He killed him and turned the kingdom to David the son of Jesse.

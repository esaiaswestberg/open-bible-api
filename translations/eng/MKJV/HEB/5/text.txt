For every high priest taken from among men is ordained for men in the things pertaining to God, so that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins,
who can have compassion on the ignorant and on those who are out of the way. For he himself also is compassed with infirmity.
And because of this he should, as for the people, so also for himself, to offer for sins.
And no man takes this honor to himself, but he who is called of God, as Aaron was.
So also Christ did not glorify Himself to be made a high priest, but He who said to Him, "You are My Son, today I have begotten You."
As He says also in another place, "You are a priest forever after the order of Melchizedek."
For Jesus, in the days of His flesh, when He had offered up prayers and supplications with strong cryings and tears to Him who was able to save Him from death, and was heard in that He feared,
though being a Son, yet He learned obedience by the things which He suffered.
And being made perfect, He became the Author of eternal salvation to all those who obey Him,
being called by God a high priest after the order of Melchizedek;
of whom we have many things to say, and hard to be explained since you are dull of hearing.
For indeed because of the time, you ought to be teachers, you have need that one teach you again what are the first principles of the oracles of God. And you have become in need of milk, and not of solid food.
For everyone who uses milk is unskillful in the word of righteousness, for he is an infant.
But solid food belongs to those who are of full age, even those who because of use have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil.

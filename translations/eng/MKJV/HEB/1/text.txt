God, who at many times and in many ways spoke in time past to the fathers by the prophets,
has in these last days spoken to us by His Son, whom He has appointed heir of all things, by whom also He made the worlds,
who being the shining splendor of His glory, and the express image of His essence, and upholding all things by the word of His power, having made purification of our sins, He sat down on the right of the Majesty on high,
being made so much better than the angels, as He has by inheritance obtained a more excellent name than they.
For to which of the angels did He say at any time, "You are My Son, this day I have begotten Thee?" And again, "I will be to Him a Father, and He shall be to Me a Son?"
And again, when He brings in the First-born into the world, He says, "And let all the angels of God worship Him."
And of the angels He says, "Who makes His angels spirits and His ministers a flame of fire."
But to the Son He says, "Your throne, O God, is forever and ever. A scepter of righteousness is the scepter of Your kingdom.
You have loved righteousness and hated iniquity, therefore God, Your God, has anointed You with the oil of gladness above Your fellows."
And, "You, Lord, have laid the foundation of the earth in the beginning, and the heavens are the works of Your hands.
They shall perish, but You will remain. And they shall all become old as a garment,
and as a covering You shall fold them up, and they shall be changed. But You are the same, and Your years shall not fail."
But to which of the angels, did He say at any time, "Sit on My right hand until I make Your enemies Your footstool?"
Are they not all ministering spirits, sent forth to minister for those who shall be heirs of salvation?

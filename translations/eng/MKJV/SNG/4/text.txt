Behold, you are beautiful, My love. Behold, you are beautiful; your eyes are like doves' from behind your veil; your hair is like a flock of goats that appear from Mount Gilead.
Your teeth are like a flock of shorn sheep, which came up from the washing; they all are bearing twins and not one is barren among them.
Your lips are like a cord of scarlet, and your speech is becoming; your temples are like a piece of pomegranate behind your veil.
Your neck is like the tower of David built for an armory, on which there hang a thousand bucklers, all shields of mighty men.
Your two breasts are like two fawns, twins of a gazelle, feeding among the lilies.
Until when the day blows, and the shadows flee away, I will go to the mountain of myrrh and to the hill of frankincense.
You are all fair, My love; no blemish is in you.
Come with Me from Lebanon, My spouse; with Me from Lebanon. Look from the top of Amana, from the top of Shenir and Hermon, from the lions' dens, from the mountains of the leopards.
You have ravished My heart, My sister, My spouse; you have ravished My heart with one of your eyes, with one chain of your neck.
How fair is your love, My sister, My spouse! How much better are your loves than wine, and the smell of your ointments than all spices!
Your lips, My spouse, drop like the honeycomb; honey and milk are under your tongue; and the smell of your garments is like the smell of Lebanon.
A locked garden is My sister, My spouse; a rock heap locked up, a fountain sealed.
Your plants are an orchard of pomegranates, with pleasant fruits; with henna and spikenard,
spikenard and saffron; calamus and cinnamon, with all trees of frankincense; myrrh and aloes, with all the chief spices;
a fountain of gardens, a well of living waters, and streams from Lebanon.
Awake, O north wind; and come, south wind; blow on my garden, so that the spices of it may flow out. Let my Beloved come into His garden and eat His pleasant fruits.

I am the rose of Sharon, a lily of the valleys.
As the lily among thorns, so is My love among the daughters.
As the apple among the trees of the wood, so is my Beloved among the sons. I sat down under His shadow with great delight, and His fruit was sweet to my taste.
He brought me to the banqueting house, and His banner over me was love.
Feed me with raisin cakes, comfort me with apples, for I am sick with love.
His left hand is under my head, and His right hand embraces me.
I charge you, O daughters of Jerusalem, by the gazelles, and by the does of the field, do not stir up or awake my Love until He please.
The voice of my Beloved! Behold, He comes leaping on the mountains, skipping on the hills.
My Beloved is like a roe or a young hart. Behold, He stands behind our wall, He looks forth at the windows, peering from the lattice.
My Beloved spoke, and said to me, Rise up, My love, My beautiful one, and come away.
For lo, the winter is past, the rain is over; it goes to itself.
the flowers appear on the earth; the time of singing has come, and the voice of the turtle-dove is heard in our land;
the fig tree puts forth her green figs, and the vines with the tender grape give a good smell. Arise, My love, My beautiful one, and come away.
O My dove, in the clefts of the rock, in the secret places of the stairs, let Me see your face, let Me hear your voice; for your voice is sweet, and your face is beautiful.
Take us the foxes, the little foxes that spoil the vines; for our vines have tender grapes.
My Beloved is mine, and I am His; He feeds among the lilies.
Until when does the day blow, and the shadows flee away? Turn, my Beloved, and be like a gazelle, or a young deer, the stag, on the mountains of Bether.

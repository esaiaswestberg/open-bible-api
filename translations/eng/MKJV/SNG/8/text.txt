Who could give You to me as my brother, who sucked my mother's breasts? When I find You outside, I would kiss You; yea, they would not despise me.
I would lead You, and bring You into my mother's house. You would instruct me; I would cause You to drink spiced wine of the juice of my pomegranate.
His left hand would be under my head, and His right embrace me.
I charge you, O daughters of Jerusalem, why should you stir up or awaken my Love until it pleases?
Who is this coming up from the wilderness, leaning on her Beloved? I awakened you under the apple tree; there your mother travailed with you; there she travailed and bore you.
Set me as a seal on Your heart, as a seal on Your arm; for love is strong as death. Jealousy is cruel as the grave; its flames are flames of fire, a flame of Jehovah.
Many waters cannot quench love, nor will the rivers overflow it. If a man would give all the wealth of his house for love, it would be scorned.
We have a little sister, and she has no breasts; what shall we do for our sister in the day when she shall be spoken for?
If she is a wall, we will build on her a palace of silver; and if she is a door, we will enclose her with boards of cedar.
I was a wall, and my breasts like towers; then I was in His eyes as one finding peace.
Solomon had a vineyard in Baal-hamon; he let out the vineyard to keepers; everyone for its fruit was to bring a thousand of silver.
My vineyard, which is mine, is before me; you, O Solomon, must have a thousand, and for the keepers of its fruit, two hundred.
You who dwell in the gardens, the companions listen to your voice; cause me to hear.
Hurry, my Beloved, and be like a gazelle, or a young deer, the stag, on the mountains of spices.

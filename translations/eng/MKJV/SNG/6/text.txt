Where has your Beloved gone, most beautiful among women? Where has your Beloved turned? For we seek Him along with you.
My Beloved has gone down to His garden, to the beds of spices, to feed in the gardens and to gather lilies.
I am my Beloved's, and my Beloved is mine; He feeds among the lilies.
O my love, you are as beautiful as Tirzah, as lovely as Jerusalem, as inspiring as an army with banners.
Turn away your eyes from Me, for they have overcome Me; your hair is like a flock of goats that appears from Gilead.
Your teeth are like a flock of ewes which go up from the washing; they all are bearing twins, and a barren one is not among them.
Your temples behind your veil are like a piece of pomegranate.
There are sixty queens, and eighty concubines, and virgins without number.
But My dove, My undefiled is one alone. She is the only one of her mother. She is the choice of her who bore her. The daughters saw her and blessed her; the queens and the concubines saw her, and they praised her.
Who is she who looks forth like the morning, fair as the moon, clear as the sun, awesome armies with banners?
I went down into the garden of nuts to see the greenery of the valley, to see whether the vine flowered and the pomegranates budded.
I did not know, but my soul set me on the chariots of my princely people.
Return, return, O Shulamite! Return, return, that we may look on you. What will you see in the Shulamite? As it were the dance of two camps.

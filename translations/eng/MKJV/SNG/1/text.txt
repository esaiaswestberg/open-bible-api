The song of songs, which is Solomon's.
Let Him kiss me with the kisses of His mouth; for Your loves are better than wine.
For Your ointments have a lovely fragrance; Your name is as oil poured out; therefore the virgins love You.
Draw me, we will run after You, The King has brought me into his chambers; we will be glad and rejoice in You, we will remember Your love more than wine; the upright love You.
I am black, but comely, O daughters of Jerusalem, like the tents of Kedar, like the curtains of Solomon.
Do not look on me, that I am black, that the sun has looked on me. My mother's sons were angry with me; they made me the keeper of the vineyards; but my vineyard I have not kept.
Tell me, You whom my soul loves, where do You feed, where do You lie down at noon? For why should I be as one who is veiled beside the flocks of Your companions?
If you know not, most beautiful among women, go in the footsteps of the flock; and feed your kids beside the shepherds' tents.
O My love, I have compared you to My mares among Pharaoh's chariots.
Your cheeks are beautiful with ornaments, your neck with chains.
We will make you borders of gold with studs of silver.
While the King is in His circle, my spikenard gives its smell.
A bundle of myrrh is my Beloved to me. He shall lie all night between my breasts.
My Beloved is to me like a cluster of henna in the vineyards of Engedi.
Behold, you are beautiful, my love; behold, you are beautiful; you have doves' eyes.
Behold, you are beautiful, my Beloved, yea, pleasant. Also our bed is green.
The beams of our house are cedar, and our rafters are of fir.

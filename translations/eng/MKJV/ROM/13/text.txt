Let every soul be subject to the higher authorities. For there is no authority but of God; the authorities that exist are ordained by God.
So that the one resisting the authority resists the ordinance of God; and the ones who resist will receive judgment to themselves.
For the rulers are not a terror to good works, but to the bad. And do you desire to be not afraid of the authority? Do the good, and you shall have praise from it.
For it is a servant of God to you for good. For if you practice evil, be afraid, for it does not bear the sword in vain; for it is a servant of God, a revenger for wrath on him who does evil.
Therefore you must be subject, not only for wrath, but also for conscience' sake.
For because of this you also pay taxes. For they are God's servants, always giving attention to this very thing.
Therefore give to all their dues; to the one due tax, the tax; tribute to whom tribute is due, fear to whom fear is due, and honor to whom honor is due.
Owe no one anything, except to love one another; for he who loves another has fulfilled the law.
For: "Do not commit adultery; do not murder; do not steal; do not bear false witness; do not lust;" and if there is any other commandment, it is summed up in this word, "You shall love your neighbor as yourself."
Love works no ill to its neighbor, therefore love is the fulfilling of the law.
This also, knowing the time, that it is already time to awake out of sleep; for now our salvation is nearer than when we believed.
The night is far spent, the day is at hand; therefore let us cast off the works of darkness, and let us put on the armor of light.
Let us walk becomingly, as in the day; not in carousings and drinking; not in co-habitation and lustful acts; not in strife and envy.
But put on the Lord Jesus Christ, and do not take thought beforehand for the lusts of the flesh.

And it happened on the day that Moses had fully set up the tabernacle, and had anointed it and sanctified it, and all the vessels of it, both the altar and all its vessels, and had anointed them and sanctified them,
and the rulers of Israel offered, the head men of their fathers' house, the rulers of the tribes; these were they who stood over the numbered ones.
And they brought their offerings before the LORD: six covered wagons and twelve oxen, a wagon for two of the rulers, an ox for each one. And they brought them before the tabernacle.
And the LORD spoke to Moses saying,
Take it from them so that they may be used in doing the service of the tabernacle of the congregation. And you shall give them to the Levites, to every man according to his service.
And Moses took the wagons and the oxen and gave them to the Levites.
He gave two wagons and four oxen to the sons of Gershon, according to their service.
And he gave four wagons and eight oxen to the sons of Merari, according to their service, under the hand of Ithamar, the son of Aaron the priest.
But to the sons of Kohath he did not give any, because the service of the sanctuary belonging to them was that which they should carry upon their shoulders.
And the rulers offered for the dedication of the altar in the day that it was anointed, even the rulers offered their offering before the altar.
And the LORD said to Moses, They shall offer their offering, each ruler on his day, for the dedication of the altar.

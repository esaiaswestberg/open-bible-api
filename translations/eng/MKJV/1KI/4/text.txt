And Solomon reigned over all kingdoms from the River to the land of the Philistines, and to the border of Egypt. They brought presents and served Solomon all the days of his life.
And Solomon's food for one day was thirty measures of fine flour and sixty measures of meal,
ten fat oxen and twenty oxen out of the pastures, and a hundred sheep, besides harts and roebucks, and fallow deer, and fattened fowl.
For he had the rule over all on this side of the River, from Tiphsah even to Azzah, over all the kings on this side the River. And he had peace on all sides all around him.
And Judah and Israel lived safely, every man under his vine and under his fig-tree, from Dan even to Beer-sheba, all the days of Solomon.
And Solomon had forty thousand stalls of horses for his chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen.
And those officers provided food for king Solomon and for all who came to king Solomon's table, every man in his month. They did not lack anything.
They also brought barley and straw for the horses and mules, to the place where the officers were, every man according to his charge.
And God gave Solomon exceeding great wisdom and understanding, and largeness of heart, even as the sand that is on the seashore.
And Solomon's wisdom was greater than the wisdom of all the sons of the east, and all the wisdom of Egypt.
For he was wiser than all men; than Ethan the Ezrahite, and Heman, and Chalcol, and Darda, the sons of Mahol. And his fame was in all nations all around.
And he spoke three thousand proverbs, and his songs were a thousand and five.
And he spoke of trees, from the cedar tree in Lebanon even to the hyssop that springs out of the wall. He spoke also of beasts and of birds, and of creeping things, and of fish.
And there came from all the people, to hear the wisdom of Solomon, from all the kings of the earth, who had heard of his wisdom.

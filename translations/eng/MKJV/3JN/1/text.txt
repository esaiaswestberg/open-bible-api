The elder to Gaius the beloved, whom I love in the truth.
Beloved, in regard to all things I pray that you prosper and be in health, even as your soul prospers.
For I rejoiced greatly when the brothers came and testified of the truth that is in you, even as you walk in the truth.
I have no greater joy than these things, to hear that my children walk in the truth.
Beloved, you do faithfully whatever you work for the brothers and for strangers,
who in love bore witness of you before the church, whom you will do well to send forward worthily of God;
because they went forth for His name's sake, taking nothing from the nations.
Therefore we ought to entertain such, so that we might be co-workers in the truth.
I wrote to the church, but Diotrephes, who loves to have the preeminence among them, did not receive us.
Therefore if I come, I will remember his deeds which he does, ranting against us with evil words. And not content with these, neither does he himself receive the brothers. And he forbids those who would, and casts them out of the church.
Beloved, do not imitate the bad, but the good. He who does good is from God, but he who does evil has not seen God.
Demetrius has good report by all, and by the truth itself. And we also bear witness, and you know that our witness is true.
I had many things to write, but I will not write to you with pen and ink,
but I trust I shall shortly see you, and we shall speak face to face. Peace be to you. The friends greet you. Greet the friends by name.

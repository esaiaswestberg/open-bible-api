I am coming to you this third time. In the mouth of two or three witnesses every word shall be established.
I told you before, and I say beforehand, as being present the second time and being absent now. I write to those who sinned before, and to all the rest, that if I come again, I will not spare.
Since you seek a proof of Christ speaking in me (who is not weak toward you, but is powerful in you;
for even if He was crucified out of weakness, yet He lives by the power of God. For indeed even we are weak in Him, but we shall live with Him by the power of God toward you),
examine yourselves, whether you are in the faith, prove your own selves. Do you not know your own selves, that Jesus Christ is in you, unless you are reprobates?
But I trust that you will know that we are not reprobates.
But I pray to God for you not to do evil, none. And not that we may appear approved, but that you should do the good things, though we are deemed to be reprobates.
For we have no power against the truth, but for the truth.
For we are glad when we are weak, and you are powerful. But we pray also for this, your perfection.
Therefore I write these things while absent, lest being present I may not deal sharply with you according to the authority which the Lord gave me for building up, and not for pulling down.
Finally, brothers, rejoice. Perfect yourselves; encourage yourselves; mind the same thing; be at peace. And the God of love and peace will be with you.
Greet one another with a holy kiss.
All the saints greet you.
May the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all. Amen.

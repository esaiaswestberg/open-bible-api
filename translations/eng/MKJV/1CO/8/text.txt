But concerning the sacrifices to idols, we know that we all have knowledge. Knowledge puffs up, but love edifies.
And if any man thinks that he knows anything, he knows nothing yet as he ought to know.
But if any one loves God, he has been known of him.
Then concerning the eating of the things sacrificed to idols, we know that an idol is nothing in the world, and that there is no other God except one.
For though there are those who are called gods, whether in Heaven or in earth (as there are many gods and many lords),
there is to us only one God, the Father, of whom are all things, and we in Him; and one Lord Jesus Christ, through whom are all things, and we by Him.
But this knowledge is not in all. But some being aware of the idol eat as an idolatrous sacrifice until now, and their conscience being weak is defiled.
But food does not commend us to God. For neither if we eat are we the better, nor if we do not eat are we the worse.
But take heed lest by any means this liberty of yours becomes a stumbling block to those who are weak.
For if anyone sees you who have knowledge sitting in an idol temple, will not the weak one's conscience be lifted up so as to eat things sacrificed to idols?
And on your knowledge the weak brother will fall, he for whom Christ died.
And sinning in this way against your brothers, and wounding their conscience, being weak, you sin against Christ.
Therefore, if food offends my brother, I will eat no flesh forever, that I do not offend my brother.

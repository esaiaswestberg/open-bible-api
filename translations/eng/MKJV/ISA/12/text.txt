And in that day you shall say, O LORD, I will praise You; though You were angry with me, turn away Your anger, and You shall comfort me.
Behold, God is my salvation; I will trust and not be afraid for the LORD JEHOVAH is my strength and my song; He also has become my salvation.
And with joy you shall draw water out of the wells of salvation.
And in that day you shall say, Praise the LORD! Call on His name; declare His doings among the people, make mention that His name is exalted.
Sing to the LORD; for He has done excellent things; this is known in all the earth.
Cry out and shout, O dweller of Zion; for great is the Holy One of Israel in your midst.

In the year that Tartan came to Ashdod, when Sargon the king of Assyria sent him, and fought against Ashdod and took it;
at that time the LORD spoke by Isaiah the son of Amoz, saying, Go and take the sackcloth off your loins, and take your shoe off your foot. And he did so, walking naked and barefoot.
And the LORD said, Just as My servant Isaiah has walked naked and barefoot three years, a sign and wonder on Egypt and on Ethiopia;
so shall the king of Assyria lead away Egypt's prisoners, and the Ethiopian exiles, young and old, naked and barefoot, even with uncovered buttocks, to the shame of Egypt.
And they shall be afraid and ashamed of Ethiopia their hope, and of Egypt their glory.
And he who lives in this coast shall say in that day, Behold, this has become of our hope to which we fled for help there, to be delivered from before the king of Assyria; and, How shall we escape?

Brothers, if a man is overtaken in a fault, you the spiritual ones restore such a one in the spirit of meekness, considering yourself, lest you also be tempted.
Bear one another's burdens, and so you will fulfill the law of Christ.
For if anyone thinks himself to be something, being nothing, he deceives himself.
But let each one prove his own work, and then he alone will have a boast in himself, and not in another.
For each one will bear his own load.
But let him who is taught in the Word share with the one teaching in all good things.
Do not be deceived, God is not mocked. For whatever a man sows, that he also will reap.
For he sowing to his flesh will reap corruption from the flesh. But he sowing to the Spirit will reap life everlasting from the Spirit.
But we should not lose heart in well-doing, for in due season we shall reap, if we do not faint.
So then as we have time, let us work good toward all, especially toward those of the household of faith.
See in what large letters I write to you with my hand.
As many as desire to look well in the flesh, these compel you to be circumcised; only lest they should suffer persecution for the cross of Christ.
For they themselves, having been circumcised, do not even keep the Law, but they desire you to be circumcised so that they may boast in your flesh.
But may it never be for me to boast, except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom the world is crucified to me, and I to the world.
For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision has any strength, nor uncircumcision, but a new creation.
And as many as walk according to this rule, peace and mercy be upon them and upon the Israel of God.
For the rest, let no one give troubles to me, for I bear in my body the brands of the Lord Jesus.
Brothers, the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen.

Make a joyful noise unto the LORD, all you lands.
Serve the LORD with gladness: come before his presence with singing.
Know all of you that the LORD he is God: it is he that has made us, and not we ourselves; we are his people, and the sheep of his pasture.
Enter into his gates with thanksgiving, and into his courts with praise: be thankful unto him, and bless his name.
For the LORD is good; his mercy is everlasting; and his truth endures to all generations.

Sing to the Lord a new song, sing to the Lord, all the earth.
Sing to the Lord, bless his name, from day to day herald his victory.
Tell his glory among the nations, his wonders among all peoples.
For great is the Lord and worthy all praise; held in awe, above all gods:
for all the gods of the nations are idols, but the Lord created the heavens.
Before him are splendour and majesty, beauty and strength in his holy place.
Ascribe to the Lord, you tribes of the nations, ascribe to the Lord glory and strength.
Ascribe to the Lord the glory he manifests: bring you an offering, enter his courts.
Bow to the Lord in holy array: tremble before him, all the earth.
Say to the nations, “The Lord is king.” The world stands firm to be shaken no more. He will judge the peoples with equity.
Let the heavens be glad and the earth rejoice, let the sea and its fulness thunder.
Let the field, and all that is in it, exult; let the trees of the forest ring out their joy
before the Lord: for he comes, he comes to judge the earth. He will judge the world with justice and the nations with faithfulness.

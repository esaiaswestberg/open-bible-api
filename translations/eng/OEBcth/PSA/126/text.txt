When the Lord turned the fortunes of Zion, we were like dreamers.
Then was our mouth filled with laughter, our tongue with glad shouts; then among the nations they said, “The Lord has dealt greatly with them.”
The Lord had dealt greatly with us, and we were rejoicing.
Turn our fortunes, O Lord, as the streams in the Negreb.
They who sow in tears shall reap with glad shouts.
Forth they fare, with their burden of seed, and they weep as they go. But home, home, with glad shouts they shall come with their arms full of sheaves.

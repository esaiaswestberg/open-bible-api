I will extol you, O Lord, because you have lifted me up, and not suffered my foes to rejoice over me.
I cried to you for help, O Lord my God, and you healed me.
You have brought me up, Lord, from Sheol, from my way to the pit back to life you have called me.
Sing praise to the Lord, faithful people; give thanks to his holy name.
For his anger lasts only a moment, his favour endures for a lifetime. Weeping may lodge for the night, but the morning brings shouts of joy.
When all went well, I imagined that never should I be shaken.
For by your favour, O Lord, you had set me on mountains strong: but you hide your face, and I was confounded.
Then to you, Lord, I cried, to the Lord I begged for mercy,
“What profit is there in my blood, if I go down to the pit? Can you be praised by dust? Can it tell of your faithfulness?
Hear, Lord, and show me your favour, Lord be a helper to me.”
You have turned my mourning to dancing; my sackcloth you have unloosed, and clothed me with joy: that unceasingly I should sing your praise, and give thanks to you, Lord my God, forever.

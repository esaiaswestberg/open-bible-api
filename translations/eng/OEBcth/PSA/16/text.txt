Keep me, O God, for in you I take refuge.
I said to the Lord, “You are my Lord, my happiness rests in you alone.
Those who are holy in the land, they, they alone, are the noble ones; all my delight is in them.”
Those who choose other gods find endless sorrow. In their offerings of blood I will have no part nor take their name on my lips.
The Lord is my share and my portion, my fate is in your strong hands.
The boundary lines of my life mark out delightful country, my heritage pleases me well.
I praise the Lord for his counsel, which so stirs my heart in the night.
I keep the Lord always in mind: with him at my hand, I can never be moved.
So my heart is glad, there is joy inside me; and in safety of body I live.
For you will not give me up to Sheol nor let any who love you see the pit.
You will show me the path that leads to life, to that fulness of joy which is in your presence, and the pleasures dispensed by your hand evermore.

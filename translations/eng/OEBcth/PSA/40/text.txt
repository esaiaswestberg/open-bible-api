For the Lord I waited and waited, till, inclining to me, he heard my cry.
From the horrible pit he drew me, up out of the miry clay; he set my feet on a rock, and my steps he made firm.
He put a new song in my mouth, of praise to our God. Many see it, and, filled with awe, put their trust in the Lord.
Happy the person who has put in the Lord their trust, not looking to false gods or turning to idols.
With us you have wrought in rich measure, O Lord our God, your marvels and purposes for us --- none may compare with you --- were I to declare or to tell them, past counting are they.
In offerings bloody or bloodless you have no delight, but with open ears you have made me. Burnt-offering and offering for sin are not what you ask.
Then said I, “Here I am, as the roll of the book has enjoined.
My delight, O God, is to do your will, and your law is within my heart.”
Well, O Lord, you know that, with lips unrestrained, your righteousness I told in the great congregation,
not hiding it in my heart. I have told of your steadfast help, from the great congregation I hid not your love and your faithfulness.
So do not restrain, Lord, your pity from us. Your love and your faithfulness --- ever may they be our shield.
For evils that cannot be numbered have compassed me round. My transgressions have followed me up --- I can bear it no more. They are more than the hairs of my head, and my heart has forsaken me.
O Lord, be pleased to deliver me, haste to my help, O Lord.
May those who are seeking my life be ashamed and confounded together; may those who delight in my hurt be defeated and brought to dishonour.
May those who hurrah over me be dumbfounded because of their shame.
But may all who seek after you rejoice and be glad in you. May all those eager for your aid, say, “Great is the Lord” evermore.
I am weak and needy, yet the Lord cares for me. You are my help and deliverer; don’t delay, my God.

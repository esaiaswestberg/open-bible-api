Lord, I call to you: hasten, to me, give ear to my voice, when I call to you.
Let my prayer be presented as incense before you, and my uplifted hands as the evening meal-offering.
Set, O Lord, a watch on my mouth, put a guard on the door of my lips.
Incline not my heart to an evil matter, to busy myself in deeds of wickedness, in company with workers of evil: never may I partake of their dainties.
A wound or reproof from a good person in kindness is oil which my head shall never refuse. In their misfortune my prayer is still with them.
Abandoned they are to the hands of their judges: they shall learn that my words are true.
Like stones on a country road cleft and broken so lie our bones scattered for Death to devour.
But my eyes are turned towards you, O Lord. Do not pour out my life, for in you I take refuge.
Keep me safe from the trap they have laid for me, from the snares of the workers of trouble.
Into their own nets let wicked people fall; while I pass by in safety.

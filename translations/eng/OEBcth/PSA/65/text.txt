It is seemly to praise you, O God, in Zion, and to you shall the vow be performed in Jerusalem.
O you who hear prayer, unto you shall all flesh come.
Our sins are too mighty for us, our transgressions you only can cover them.
Happy the person whom you choose to live beside you in your courts. O may we be filled with the joys of your house, of your holy temple.
In dread deeds you loyally answer us, O God of our salvation, whom all ends of the earth put their trust in, and islands far away.
By your strength you establish the hills, you are armed with might;
you still the roaring of seas, and the turmoil of nations,
so that those who live at earth’s bounds are awed at your signs: the lands of the sunrise and sunset you make to ring with joy.
You visit and water the earth; you greatly enrich her with the river of God, which is full of water. You prepare the corn thereof,
watering her furrows, settling her ridges; you make her soft with showers, and bless what grows thereon.
You crown the year with your goodness, your chariot-tracks drip with fatness.
The desert pastures are lush, the hills greened with joy.
The meadows are clothed with flocks, the valleys are covered with corn; they shout to each other and sing.

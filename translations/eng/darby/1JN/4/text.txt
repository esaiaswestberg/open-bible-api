Beloved, believe not every spirit, but prove the spirits, if they are ofGod; because many false prophets are gone out into the world.
Hereby ye know the Spirit ofGod: every spirit which confesses Jesus Christ come in flesh is ofGod;
and every spirit which does not confess Jesus Christ come in flesh is not ofGod: and this is that [power] of the antichrist, [of] which ye have heard that it comes, and now it is already in the world.
Ye are ofGod, children, and have overcome them, because greater is he that [is] in you than he that [is] in the world.
They are of the world; for this reason they speak [as] of the world, and the world hears them.
We are ofGod; he that knowsGod hears us; he who is not ofGod does not hear us. From this we know the spirit of truth and the spirit of error.
Beloved, let us love one another; because love is ofGod, and every one that loves has been begotten ofGod, and knowsGod.
He that loves not has not knownGod; forGod is love.
Herein as to us has been manifested the love ofGod, thatGod has sent his only begotten Son into the world, that we might live through him.
Herein is love, not that we lovedGod, but that he loved us, and sent his Son a propitiation for our sins.
Beloved, ifGod has so loved us, we also ought to love one another.
No one has seenGod at any time: if we love one another,God abides in us, and his love is perfected in us.
Hereby we know that we abide in him and he in us, that he has given to us of his Spirit.
And we have seen, and testify, that the Father has sent the Son [as] Saviour of the world.
Whosoever shall confess that Jesus is the Son ofGod,God abides in him, and he inGod.
And we have known and have believed the love whichGod has to us.God is love, and he that abides in love abides inGod, andGod in him.
Herein has love been perfected with us that we may have boldness in the day of judgment, that even as he is, we also are in this world.
There is no fear in love, but perfect love casts out fear; for fear has torment, and he that fears has not been made perfect in love.
We love because he has first loved us.
If any one say, I loveGod, and hate his brother, he is a liar: for he that loves not his brother whom he has seen, how can he loveGod whom he has not seen?
And this commandment have we from him, That he that lovesGod love also his brother.

Shout aloud unto Jehovah, all the earth!
Serve Jehovah with joy: come before his presence with exultation.
Know that Jehovah isGod: it is he that hath made us, and not we ourselves; [we are] his people, and the sheep of his pasture.
Enter into his gates with thanksgiving [and] into his courts with praise; give thanks unto him, bless his name:
For Jehovah is good; his loving-kindness [endureth] for ever; and his faithfulness from generation to generation.

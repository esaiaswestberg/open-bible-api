Be gracious unto me, OGod; for man would swallow me up: all the day long fighting he oppresseth me.
Mine enemies would swallow [me] up all the day long; for they are many that fight against me haughtily.
In the day that I am afraid, I will confide in thee.
InGod will I praise his word, inGod I put my confidence: I will not fear; what can flesh do unto me?
All the day long they wrest my words; all their thoughts are against me for evil.
They gather themselves together, they hide themselves; they mark my steps, because they wait for my soul.
Shall they escape by iniquity? In anger cast down the peoples, OGod.
Thou countest my wanderings; put my tears into thy bottle: are they not in thy book?
Then shall mine enemies return backward in the day when I call: this I know, forGod is for me.
InGod will I praise [his] word; in Jehovah will I praise [his] word.
InGod have I put my confidence: I will not fear; what can man do unto me?
Thy vows are upon me, OGod: I will render thanks unto thee.
For thou hast delivered my soul from death; [wilt thou] not [keep] my feet from falling, that I may walk beforeGod in the light of the living?

Make haste, OGod, to deliver me; Jehovah, [hasten] to my help.
Let them be ashamed and brought to confusion that seek after my soul; let them be turned backward and confounded that take pleasure in mine adversity;
Let them turn back because of their shame that say, Aha! Aha!
Let all those that seek thee be glad and rejoice in thee, and let such as love thy salvation say continually, LetGod be magnified!
But I am afflicted and needy: make haste unto me, OGod. Thou art my help and my deliverer: O Jehovah, make no delay.

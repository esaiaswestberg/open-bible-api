Why boastest thou thyself in evil, thou mighty man? The loving-kindness ofGod [abideth] continually.
Thy tongue deviseth mischievous things, like a sharp razor, practising deceit.
Thou hast loved evil rather than good, lying rather than to speak righteousness. Selah.
Thou hast loved all devouring words, O deceitful tongue!
God shall likewise destroy thee for ever; he shall take thee away, and pluck thee out of [thy] tent, and root thee out of the land of the living. Selah.
The righteous also shall see, and fear, and shall laugh at him, [saying,]
Behold the man that made notGod his strength, but put confidence in the abundance of his riches, [and] strengthened himself in his avarice.
But as for me, I am like a green olive-tree in the house ofGod: I will confide in the loving-kindness ofGod for ever and ever.
I will praise thee for ever, because thou hast done [it]; and I will wait on thy name, before thygodly ones, for it is good.

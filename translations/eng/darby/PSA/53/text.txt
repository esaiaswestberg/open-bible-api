The fool hath said in his heart, There is noGod! They have corrupted themselves, and have done abominable iniquity: there is none that doeth good.
God looked down from the heavens upon the children of men, to see if there were any that did understand, that did seekGod.
Every one of them is gone back, they are together become corrupt: there is none that doeth good, not even one.
Have the workers of iniquity no knowledge, eating up my people [as] they eat bread? they call not uponGod.
There were they in great fear, where no fear was; forGod scattereth the bones of him that encampeth against thee. Thou hast put [them] to shame, forGod hath despised them.
Oh that the salvation of Israel were come out of Zion! WhenGod turneth again the captivity of his people, Jacob shall be glad, Israel shall rejoice.

OGod, by thy name save me, and by thy strength do me justice.
OGod, hear my prayer; give ear to the words of my mouth.
For strangers are risen up against me, and the violent seek after my life: they have not setGod before them. Selah.
Behold,God is my helper; the Lord is among them that uphold my soul.
He will requite evil to mine enemies: in thy truth cut them off.
I will freely sacrifice unto thee; I will praise thy name, O Jehovah, because it is good.
For he hath delivered me out of all trouble; and mine eye hath seen [its desire] upon mine enemies.

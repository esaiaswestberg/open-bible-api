Alleluia.  I had confidence, because of what I was saying, but then I was greatly humbled.
I said in my excess, “Every man is a liar.”
What shall I repay to the Lord, for all the things that he has repaid to me?
I will take up the cup of salvation, and I will call upon the name of the Lord.
I will repay my vows to the Lord, in the sight of all his people.
Precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of his holy ones.
O Lord, because I am your servant, your servant and the son of your handmaid, you have broken my bonds.
I will sacrifice to you the sacrifice of praise, and I will invoke the name of the Lord.
I will repay my vows to the Lord in the sight of all his people,
in the courts of the house of the Lord, in your midst, O Jerusalem.

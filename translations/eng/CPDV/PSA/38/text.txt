Unto the end. For Jeduthun himself. A Canticle of David.
I said, “I will keep to my ways, so that I will not offend with my tongue.” I posted a guard at my mouth, when a sinner took up a position against me.
I was silenced and humbled, and I was quiet before good things, and my sorrow was renewed.
My heart grew hot within me, and, during my meditation, a fire would flare up.
I spoke with my tongue, “O Lord, make me know my end, and what the number of my days will be, so that I may know what is lacking to me.”
Behold, you have made my days measurable, and, before you, my substance is as nothing. Yet truly, all things are vanity: every living man.
So then, truly man passes by like an image; even so, he is disquieted in vain. He stores up, and he knows not for whom he will gather these things.
And now, what is it that awaits me? Is it not the Lord? And my substance is with you.
Rescue me from all my iniquities. You have handed me over as a reproach to the foolish.
I was silenced, and I did not open my mouth, because it was you who acted.
Remove your scourges from me.
I fall short at corrections from the strength of your hand. For you have chastised man for iniquity. And you have made his soul shrink away like a spider. Nevertheless, it is in vain that any man be disquieted.
O Lord, heed my prayer and my supplication. Pay attention to my tears. Do not be silent. For I am a newcomer with you, and a sojourner, just as all my fathers were.
Forgive me, so that I may be refreshed, before I will go forth and be no more.

Alleluia.  Praise the Lord in his holy places. Praise him in the firmament of his power.
Praise him for his virtues. Praise him according to the multitude of his greatness.
Praise him with the sound of the trumpet. Praise him with psaltery and stringed instrument.
Praise him with timbrel and choir. Praise him with strings and organ.
Praise him with sweet-sounding cymbals. Praise him with cymbals of jubilation.
Let every spirit praise the Lord. Alleluia.

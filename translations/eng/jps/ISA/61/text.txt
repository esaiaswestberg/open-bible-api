The spirit of the L-rd GOD is upon me; because HaShem hath anointed me to bring good tidings unto the humble; He hath sent me to bind up the broken-hearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and the opening of the eyes to them that are bound;
To proclaim the year of HaShem'S good pleasure, and the day of vengeance of our G-d; to comfort all that mourn;
To appoint unto them that mourn in Zion, to give unto them a garland for ashes, the oil of joy for mourning, the mantle of praise for the spirit of heaviness; that they might be called terebinths of righteousness, the planting of HaShem, wherein He might glory.
And they shall build the old wastes, they shall raise up the former desolations, and they shall renew the waste cities, the desolations of many generations.
And strangers shall stand and feed your flocks, and aliens shall be your plowmen and your vinedressers.
But ye shall be named the priests of HaShem, men shall call you the ministers of our G-d; ye shall eat the wealth of the nations, and in their splendour shall ye revel.
For your shame which was double, and for that they rejoiced: 'Confusion is their portion'; therefore in their land they shall possess double, everlasting joy shall be unto them.
For I HaShem love justice, I hate robbery with iniquity; and I will give them their recompense in truth, and I will make an everlasting covenant with them.
And their seed shall be known among the nations, and their offspring among the peoples; all that see them shall acknowledge them, that they are the seed which HaShem hath blessed.
I will greatly rejoice in HaShem, my soul shall be joyful in my G-d; for He hath clothed me with the garments of salvation, He hath covered me with the robe of victory, as a bridegroom putteth on a priestly diadem, and as a bride adorneth herself with her jewels.
For as the earth bringeth forth her growth, and as the garden causeth the things that are sown in it to spring forth; so the L-rd GOD will cause victory and glory to spring forth before all the nations.

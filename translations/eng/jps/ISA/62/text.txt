For Zion's sake will I not hold My peace, and for Jerusalem's sake I will not rest, until her triumph go forth as brightness, and her salvation as a torch that burneth.
And the nations shall see thy triumph, and all kings thy glory; and thou shalt be called by a new name, which the mouth of HaShem shall mark out.
Thou shalt also be a crown of beauty in the hand of HaShem, and a royal diadem in the open hand of thy G-d.
Thou shalt no more be termed Forsaken, neither shall thy land any more be termed Desolate; but thou shalt be called, My delight is in her, and thy land, Espoused; for HaShem delighteth in thee, and thy land shall be espoused.
For as a young man espouseth a virgin, so shall thy sons espouse thee; and as the bridegroom rejoiceth over the bride, so shall thy G-d rejoice over thee.
I have set watchmen upon thy walls, O Jerusalem, they shall never hold their peace day nor night: 'Ye that are HaShem'S remembrancers, take ye no rest,
And give Him no rest, till He establish, and till He make Jerusalem a praise in the earth.'
HaShem hath sworn by His right hand, and by the arm of His strength: Surely I will no more give thy corn to be food for thine enemies; and strangers shall not drink thy wine, for which thou hast laboured;
But they that have garnered it shall eat it, and praise HaShem, and they that have gathered it shall drink it in the courts of My sanctuary.
Go through, go through the gates, clear ye the way of the people; cast up, cast up the highway, gather out the stones; lift up an ensign over the peoples.
Behold, HaShem hath proclaimed unto the end of the earth: say ye to the daughter of Zion: 'Behold, thy salvation cometh; behold, His reward is with Him, and His recompense before Him.'
And they shall call them The holy people, the redeemed of HaShem; and thou shalt be called Sought out, a city not forsaken.

Wisdom hath builded her house, she hath hewn out her seven pillars;
She hath prepared her meat, she hath mingled her wine; she hath also furnished her table.
She hath sent forth her maidens, she calleth, upon the highest places of the city:
'Whoso is thoughtless, let him turn in hither'; as for him that lacketh understanding, she saith to him:
'Come, eat of my bread, and drink of the wine which I have mingled.
Forsake all thoughtlessness, and live; and walk in the way of understanding.
He that correcteth a scorner getteth to himself shame, and he that reproveth a wicked man, it becometh unto him a blot.
Reprove not a scorner, lest he hate thee; reprove a wise man, and he will love thee.
Give to a wise man, and he will be yet wiser; teach a righteous man, and he will increase in learning.
The fear of HaShem is the beginning of wisdom, and the knowledge of the All-holy is understanding.
For by me thy days shall be multiplied, and the years of thy life shall be increased.
If thou art wise, thou art wise for thyself; and if thou scornest, thou alone shalt bear it.'
The woman Folly is riotous; she is thoughtless, and knoweth nothing.
And she sitteth at the door of her house, on a seat in the high places of the city,
To call to them that pass by, who go right on their ways:
'Whoso is thoughtless, let him turn in hither'; and as for him that lacketh understanding, she saith to him:
'Stolen waters are sweet, and bread eaten in secret is pleasant.'
But he knoweth not that the shades are there; that her guests are in the depths of the nether-world.

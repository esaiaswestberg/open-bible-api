Doth not wisdom call, and understanding put forth her voice?
In the top of high places by the way, where the paths meet, she standeth;
Beside the gates, at the entry of the city, at the coming in at the doors, she crieth aloud:
'Unto you, O men, I call, and my voice is to the sons of men.
O ye thoughtless, understand prudence, and, ye fools, be ye of an understanding heart.
Hear, for I will speak excellent things, and the opening of my lips shall be right things.
For my mouth shall utter truth, and wickedness is an abomination to my lips.
All the words of my mouth are in righteousness, there is nothing perverse or crooked in them.
They are all plain to him that understandeth, and right to them that find knowledge.
Receive my instruction, and not silver, and knowledge rather than choice gold.
For wisdom is better than rubies, and all things desirable are not to be compared unto her.
I wisdom dwell with prudence, and find out knowledge of devices.
The fear of HaShem is to hate evil; pride, and arrogancy, and the evil way, and the froward mouth, do I hate.
Counsel is mine, and sound wisdom; I am understanding, power is mine.
By me kings reign, and princes decree justice.
By me princes rule, and nobles, even all the judges of the earth.
I love them that love me, and those that seek me earnestly shall find me.
Riches and honour are with me; yea, enduring riches and righteousness.
My fruit is better than gold, yea, than fine gold; and my produce than choice silver.
I walk in the way of righteousness, in the midst of the paths of justice;
That I may cause those that love me to inherit substance, and that I may fill their treasuries.
HaShem made me as the beginning of His way, the first of His works of old.
I was set up from everlasting, from the beginning, or ever the earth was.
When there were no depths, I was brought forth; when there were no fountains abounding with water.
Before the mountains were settled, before the hills was I brought forth;
While as yet He had not made the earth, nor the fields, nor the beginning of the dust of the world.
When He established the heavens, I was there; when He set a circle upon the face of the deep,
When He made firm the skies above, when the fountains of the deep showed their might,
When He gave to the sea His decree, that the waters should not transgress His commandment, when He appointed the foundations of the earth;
Then I was by Him, as a nursling; and I was daily all delight, playing always before Him,
Playing in His habitable earth, and my delights are with the sons of men.
Now therefore, ye children, hearken unto me; for happy are they that keep my ways.
Hear instruction, and be wise, and refuse it not.
Happy is the man that hearkeneth to me, watching daily at my gates, waiting at the posts of my doors.
For whoso findeth me findeth life, and obtaineth favour of HaShem.
But he that misseth me wrongeth his own soul; all they that hate me love death.'

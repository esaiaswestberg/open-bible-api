Of Edom. Thus saith HaShem of hosts: Is wisdom no more in Teman? Is counsel perished from the prudent? Is their wisdom vanished?
Flee ye, turn back, dwell deep, O inhabitants of Dedan; for I do bring the calamity of Esau upon him, the time that I shall punish him.
If grape-gatherers came to thee, would they not leave some gleaning grapes? if thieves by night, would they not destroy till they had enough?

And I will cause Elam to be dismayed before their enemies, and before them that seek their life; and I will bring evil upon them, even My fierce anger, saith HaShem; and I will send the sword after them, till I have consumed them;
And I will set My throne in Elam, and will destroy from thence king and princes, saith HaShem.
But it shall come to pass in the end of days, that I will bring back the captivity of Elam, saith HaShem.

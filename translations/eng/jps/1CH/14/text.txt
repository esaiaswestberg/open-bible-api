And Huram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, and cedar-trees, and masons, and carpenters, to build him a house.
And David perceived that HaShem had established him king over Israel, for his kingdom was exalted exceedingly, for His people Israel's sake.
And David took more wives at Jerusalem; and David begot more sons and daughters.
And these are the names of the children whom he had in Jerusalem: Shammua, and Shobab, Nathan, and Solomon;
and Ibhar, and Elishua, and Elpelet;
and Nogah, and Nepheg, and Japhia;
and Elishama, and Beeliada, and Eliphelet.
And when the Philistines heard that David was anointed king over all Israel, all the Philistines went up to seek David; and David heard of it, and went out to meet them.
Now the Philistines had come and made a raid in the valley of Rephaim.
And David inquired of G-d, saying: 'Shall I go up against the Philistines? and wilt Thou deliver them into my hand?' And HaShem said unto him: 'Go up; for I will deliver them into thy hand.'
So they came up to Baal-perazim, and David smote them there; and David said: 'G-d hath broken mine enemies by my hand, like the breach of waters.' Therefore they called the name of that place Baal-perazim.
And they left their gods there; and David gave commandment, and they were burned with fire.
And the Philistines yet again made a raid in the valley.
And David inquired again of G-d; and G-d said unto him: 'Thou shalt not go up after them; turn away from them, and come upon them over against the mulberry-trees.
And it shall be, when thou hearest the sound of marching in the tops of the mulberry-trees, that then thou shalt go out to battle; for G-d is gone out before thee to smite the host of the Philistines.'
And David did as G-d commanded him; and they smote the host of the Philistines from Gibeon even to Gezer.
And the fame of David went out into all lands; and HaShem brought the fear of him upon all nations.

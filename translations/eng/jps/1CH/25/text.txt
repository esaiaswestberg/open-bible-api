Moreover David and the captains of the host separated for the service certain of the sons of Asaph, and of Heman, and of Jeduthun, who should prophesy with harps, with psalteries, and with cymbals; and the number of them that did the work according to their service was:
of the sons of Asaph: Zaccur, and Joseph, and Nethaniah, and Asarelah, the sons of Asaph; under the hand of Asaph, who prophesied according to the direction of the king.
Of Jeduthun: the sons of Jeduthun: Gedaliah, and Zeri, and Jeshaiah, Hashabiah, and Mattithiah, six; under the hands of their father Jeduthun with the harp, who prophesied in giving thanks and praising HaShem.
Of Heman: the sons of Heman: Bukkiah, Mattaniah, Uzziel, Shebuel, and Jerimoth, Hananiah, Hanani, Eliathah, Giddalti, and Romamti-ezer, Joshbekashah, Mallothi, Hothir, Mahazioth;
all these were the sons of Heman the king's seer in the things pertaining to G-d, to lift up the horn. And G-d gave to Heman fourteen sons and three daughters.
All these were under the hands of their fathers for song in the house of HaShem, with cymbals, psalteries, and harps, for the service of the house of G-d, according to the direction of the king--Asaph, Jeduthun, and Heman.
And the number of them, with their brethren that were instructed in singing unto HaShem, even all that were skilful, was two hundred fourscore and eight.

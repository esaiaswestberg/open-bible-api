And Hannah prayed, and said: my heart exulteth in HaShem, my horn is exalted in HaShem; my mouth is enlarged over mine enemies; because I rejoice in Thy salvation.
There is none holy as HaShem, for there is none beside Thee; neither is there any rock like our G-d.
Multiply not exceeding proud talk; let not arrogancy come out of your mouth; for HaShem is a G-d of knowledge, and by Him actions are weighed.
The bows of the mighty men are broken, and they that stumbled are girded with strength.
They that were full have hired out themselves for bread; and they that were hungry have ceased; while the barren hath borne seven, she that had many children hath languished.
HaShem killeth, and maketh alive; He bringeth down to the grave, and bringeth up.
HaShem maketh poor, and maketh rich; He bringeth low, He also lifteth up.
He raiseth up the poor out of the dust, He lifteth up the needy from the dung-hill, to make them sit with princes, and inherit the throne of glory; for the pillars of the earth are HaShem'S, and He hath set the world upon them.
He will keep the feet of His holy ones, but the wicked shall be put to silence in darkness; for not by strength shall man prevail.
They that strive with HaShem shall be broken to pieces; against them will He thunder in heaven; HaShem will judge the ends of the earth; and He will give strength unto His king, and exalt the horn of His anointed.
And Elkanah went to Ramah to his house. And the child did minister unto HaShem before Eli the priest.
Now the sons of Eli were base men; they knew not HaShem.
And the custom of the priests with the people was, that, when any man offered sacrifice, the priest's servant came, while the flesh was in seething, with a flesh-hook of three teeth in his band;
and he struck it into the pan, or kettle, or caldron, or pot; all that the flesh-hook brought up the priest took therewith. So they did unto all the Israelites that came thither in Shiloh.
Yea, before the fat was made to smoke, the priest's servant came, and said to the man that sacrificed: 'Give flesh to roast for the priest; for he will not have sodden flesh of thee, but raw.'
And if the man said unto him: 'Let the fat be made to smoke first of all, and then take as much as thy soul desireth'; then he would say: 'Nay, but thou shalt give it me now; and if not, I will take it by force.'
And the sin of the young men was very great before HaShem; for the men dealt contemptuously with the offering of HaShem.
But Samuel ministered before HaShem, being a child, girded with a linen ephod.
Moreover his mother made him a little robe, and brought it to him from year to year, when she came up with her husband to offer the yearly sacrifice.
And Eli would bless Elkanah and his wife, and say: 'The HaShem give thee seed of this woman for the loan which was lent to HaShem.' And they would go unto their own home.
So HaShem remembered Hannah, and she conceived, and bore three sons and two daughters. And the child Samuel grew before HaShem.
Now Eli was very old; and he heard all that his sons did unto all Israel, and how that they lay with the women that did service at the door of the tent of meeting.
And he said unto them: 'Why do ye such things? for I hear evil reports concerning you from all this people.
Nay, my sons; for it is no good report which I hear HaShem'S people do spread abroad.
If one man sin against another, G-d shall judge him; but if a man sin against HaShem, who shall entreat for him?' But they hearkened not unto the voice of their father, because HaShem would slay them.
And the child Samuel grew on, and increased in favour both with HaShem, and also with men.
And there came a man of G-d unto Eli, and said unto him: 'Thus saith HaShem: Did I reveal Myself unto the house of thy father, when they were in Egypt in bondage to Pharaoh's house?
And did I choose him out of all the tribes of Israel to be My priest, to go up unto Mine altar, to burn incense, to wear an ephod before Me? and did I give unto the house of thy father all the offerings of the children of Israel made by fire?
Wherefore kick ye at My sacrifice and at Mine offering, which I have commanded in My habitation; and honourest thy sons above Me, to make yourselves fat with the chiefest of all the offerings of Israel My people?
Therefore HaShem, the G-d of Israel, saith: I said indeed that thy house, and the house of thy father, should walk before Me for ever; but now HaShem saith: Be it far from Me: for them that honour Me I will honour, and they that despise Me shall be lightly esteemed.
Behold, the days come, that I will cut off thine arm, and the arm of thy father's house, that there shall not be an old man in thy house.
And thou shalt behold a rival in My habitation, in all the good which shall be done to Israel; and there shall not be an old man in thy house for ever.
Yet will I not cut off every man of thine from Mine altar, to make thine eyes to fail, and thy heart to languish; and all the increase of thy house shall die young men.
And this shall be the sign unto thee, that which shall come upon thy two sons, on Hophni and Phinehas: in one day they shall die both of them.
And I will raise Me up a faithful priest, that shall do according to that which is in My heart and in My mind; and I will build him a sure house; and he shall walk before Mine anointed for ever.
And it shall come to pass, that every one that is left in thy house shall come and bow down to him for a piece of silver and a loaf of bread, and shall say: Put me, I pray thee, into one of the priests' offices, that I may eat a morsel of bread.'

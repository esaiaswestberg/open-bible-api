And G-d spoke unto Moses, and said unto him: 'I am HaShem;
and I appeared unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob, as G-d Almighty, but by My name "HaShem" I made Me not known to them.
And I have also established My covenant with them, to give them the land of Canaan, the land of their sojournings, wherein they sojourned.
And moreover I have heard the groaning of the children of Israel, whom the Egyptians keep in bondage; and I have remembered My covenant.
Wherefore say unto the children of Israel: I am HaShem, and I will bring you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians, and I will deliver you from their bondage, and I will redeem you with an outstretched arm, and with great judgments;
and I will take you to Me for a people, and I will be to you a G-d; and ye shall know that I am HaShem your G-d, who brought you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians.
And I will bring you in unto the land, concerning which I lifted up My hand to give it to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob; and I will give it you for a heritage: I am HaShem.'
And Moses spoke so unto the children of Israel; but they hearkened not unto Moses for impatience of spirit, and for cruel bondage.
And HaShem spoke unto Moses, saying:
'Go in, speak unto Pharaoh king of Egypt, that he let the children of Israel go out of his land.'
And Moses spoke before HaShem, saying: 'Behold, the children of Israel have not hearkened unto me; how then shall Pharaoh hear me, who am of uncircumcised lips?'
And HaShem spoke unto Moses and unto Aaron, and gave them a charge unto the children of Israel, and unto Pharaoh king of Egypt, to bring the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt.

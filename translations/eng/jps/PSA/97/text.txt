HaShem reigneth; let the earth rejoice; let the multitude of isles be glad.
Clouds and darkness are round about Him; righteousness and justice are the foundation of His throne.
A fire goeth before Him, and burneth up His adversaries round about.
His lightnings lighted up the world; the earth saw, and trembled.
The mountains melted like wax at the presence of HaShem, at the presence of the L-rd of the whole earth.
The heavens declared His righteousness, and all the peoples saw His glory.
Ashamed be all they that serve graven images, that boast themselves of things of nought; bow down to Him, all ye gods.
Zion heard and was glad, and the daughters of Judah rejoiced; because of Thy judgments, O HaShem.
For Thou, HaShem, art most high above all the earth; Thou art exalted far above all gods.
O ye that love HaShem, hate evil; He preserveth the souls of His saints; He delivered them out of the hand of the wicked.
Light is sown for the righteous, and gladness for the upright in heart.
Be glad in HaShem, ye righteous; and give thanks to His holy name.

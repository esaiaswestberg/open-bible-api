For the Leader. A Psalm of the sons of Korah.
HaShem, Thou hast been favourable unto Thy land, Thou hast turned the captivity of Jacob.
Thou hast forgiven the iniquity of Thy people, Thou hast pardoned all their sin. Selah
Thou hast withdrawn all Thy wrath; Thou hast turned from the fierceness of Thine anger.
Restore us, O G-d of our salvation, and cause Thine indignation toward us to cease.
Wilt Thou be angry with us for ever? Wilt Thou draw out Thine anger to all generations?
Wilt Thou not quicken us again, that Thy people may rejoice in Thee?
Show us Thy mercy, O HaShem, and grant us Thy salvation.
I will hear what G-d HaShem will speak; for He will speak peace unto His people, and to His saints; but let them not turn back to folly.
Surely His salvation is nigh them that fear Him; that glory may dwell in our land.
Mercy and truth are met together; righteousness and peace have kissed each other.
Truth springeth out of the earth; and righteousness hath looked down from heaven.
Yea, HaShem will give that which is good; and our land shall yield her produce.
Righteousness shall go before Him, and shall make His footsteps a way.

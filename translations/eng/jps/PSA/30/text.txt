A Psalm; a Song at the Dedication of the House; of David.
I will extol thee, O HaShem, for Thou hast raised me up, and hast not suffered mine enemies to rejoice over me.
O HaShem my G-d, I cried unto Thee, and Thou didst heal me;
O HaShem, Thou broughtest up my soul from the nether-world; Thou didst keep me alive, that I should not go down to the pit.
Sing praise unto HaShem, O ye His godly ones, and give thanks to His holy name.
For His anger is but for a moment, His favour is for a life-time; weeping may tarry for the night, but joy cometh in the morning.
Now I had said in my security: 'I shall never be moved.'
Thou hadst established, O HaShem, in Thy favour my mountain as a stronghold--Thou didst hide Thy face; I was affrighted.
Unto Thee, O HaShem, did I call, and unto HaShem I made supplication:
'What profit is there in my blood, when I go down to the pit? Shall the dust praise Thee? shall it declare Thy truth?
Hear, O HaShem, and be gracious unto me; HaShem, be Thou my helper.'
Thou didst turn for me my mourning into dancing; Thou didst loose my sackcloth, and gird me with gladness;
So that my glory may sing praise to Thee, and not be silent; O HaShem my G-d, I will give thanks unto Thee for ever.

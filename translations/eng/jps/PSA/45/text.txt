For the Leader; upon Shoshannim; a Psalm of the sons of Korah. Maschil. A Song of loves.
My heart overfloweth with a goodly matter; I say: 'My work is concerning a king'; my tongue is the pen of a ready writer.
Thou art fairer than the children of men; grace is poured upon thy lips; therefore G-d hath blessed thee for ever.
Gird thy sword upon thy thigh, O mighty one, Thy glory and thy majesty.
And in thy majesty prosper, ride on, in behalf of truth and meekness and righteousness; and let thy right hand teach thee tremendous things.
Thine arrows are sharp--the peoples fall under thee-- they sink into the heart of the king's enemies.
Thy throne given of G-d is for ever and ever; a sceptre of equity is the sceptre of thy kingdom.
Thou hast loved righteousness, and hated wickedness; therefore G-d, thy G-d, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows.
Myrrh, and aloes, and cassia are all thy garments; out of ivory palaces stringed instruments have made thee glad.
Kings' daughters are among thy favourites; at thy right hand doth stand the queen in gold of Ophir.
'Hearken, O daughter, and consider, and incline thine ear; forget also thine own people, and thy father's house;
So shall the king desire thy beauty; for he is thy lord; and do homage unto him.
And, O daughter of Tyre, the richest of the people shall entreat thy favour with a gift.'
All glorious is the king's daughter within the palace; her raiment is of chequer work inwrought with gold.
She shall be led unto the king on richly woven stuff; the virgins her companions in her train being brought unto thee.
They shall be led with gladness and rejoicing; they shall enter into the king's palace.
Instead of thy fathers shall be thy sons, whom thou shalt make princes in all the land.
I will make thy name to be remembered in all generations; therefore shall the peoples praise thee for ever and ever.

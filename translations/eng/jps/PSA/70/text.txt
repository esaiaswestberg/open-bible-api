For the Leader. A Psalm of David; to make memorial. O G-d, to deliver me, O HaShem, to help me, make haste.
Let them be ashamed and abashed that seek after my soul; let them be turned backward and brought to confusion that delight in my hurt.
Let them be turned back by reason of their shame that say: 'Aha, aha.'
Let all those that seek Thee rejoice and be glad in Thee; and let such as love Thy salvation say continually: 'Let G-d be magnified.'
But I am poor and needy; O G-d, make haste unto me; Thou art my help and my deliverer; O HaShem, tarry not.

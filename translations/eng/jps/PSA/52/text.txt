For the Leader. Maschil of David;
when Doeg the Edomite came and told Saul, and said unto him: 'David is come to the house of Ahimelech.'
Why boastest thou thyself of evil, O mighty man? The mercy of G-d endureth continually.
Thy tongue deviseth destruction; like a sharp razor, working deceitfully.
Thou lovest evil more than good; falsehood rather than speaking righteousness. Selah
Thou lovest all devouring words, the deceitful tongue.
G-d will likewise break thee for ever, He will take thee up, and pluck thee out of thy tent, and root thee out of the land of the living. Selah
The righteous also shall see, and fear, and shall laugh at him:
'Lo, this is the man that made not G-d his stronghold; but trusted in the abundance of his riches, and strengthened himself in his wickedness.'
But as for me, I am like a leafy olive-tree in the house of G-d; I trust in the mercy of G-d for ever and ever.
I will give Thee thanks for ever, because Thou hast done it; and I will wait for Thy name, for it is good, in the presence of Thy saints.

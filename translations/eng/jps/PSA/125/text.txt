A Song of Ascents. They that trust in HaShem are as mount Zion, which cannot be moved, but abideth for ever.
As the mountains are round about Jerusalem, so HaShem is round about His people, from this time forth and for ever.
For the rod of wickedness shall not rest upon the lot of the righteous; that the righteous put not forth their hands unto iniquity.
Do good, O HaShem, unto the good, and to them that are upright in their hearts.
But as for such as turn aside unto their crooked ways, HaShem will lead them away with the workers of iniquity. Peace be upon Israel.

Hallelujah. I will give thanks unto HaShem with my whole heart, in the council of the upright, and in the congregation.
The works of HaShem are great, sought out of all them that have delight therein.
His work is glory and majesty; and His righteousness endureth for ever.
He hath made a memorial for His wonderful works; HaShem is gracious and full of compassion.
He hath given food unto them that fear Him; He will ever be mindful of His covenant.
He hath declared to His people the power of His works, in giving them the heritage of the nations.
The works of His hands are truth and justice; all His precepts are sure.
They are established for ever and ever, they are done in truth and uprightness.
He hath sent redemption unto His people; He hath commanded His covenant for ever; Holy and awful is His name.
The fear of HaShem is the beginning of wisdom; a good understanding have all they that do thereafter; His praise endureth for ever.

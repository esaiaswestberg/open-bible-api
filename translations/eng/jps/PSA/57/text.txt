For the Leader; Al-tashheth. A Psalm of David; Michtam; when he fled from Saul, in the cave.
Be gracious unto me, O G-d, be gracious unto me, for in Thee hath my soul taken refuge; yea, in the shadow of Thy wings will I take refuge, until calamities be overpast.
I will cry unto G-d Most high; unto G-d that accomplisheth it for me.
He will send from heaven, and save me, when he that would swallow me up taunteth; Selah; G-d shall send forth His mercy and His truth.
My soul is among lions, I do lie down among them that are aflame; even the sons of men, whose teeth are spears and arrows, and their tongue a sharp sword.
Be Thou exalted, O G-d, above the heavens; Thy glory be above all the earth.
They have prepared a net for my steps, my soul is bowed down; they have digged a pit before me, they are fallen into the midst thereof themselves. Selah
My heart is stedfast, O G-d, my heart is stedfast; I will sing, yea, I will sing praises.
Awake, my glory; awake, psaltery and harp; I will awake the dawn.
I will give thanks unto Thee, O L-rd, among the peoples; I will sing praises unto Thee among the nations.
For Thy mercy is great unto the heavens, and Thy truth unto the skies.
Be Thou exalted, O G-d, above the heavens; Thy glory be above all the earth.

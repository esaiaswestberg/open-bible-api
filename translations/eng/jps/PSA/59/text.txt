For the Leader; Al-tashheth. A Psalm of David; Michtam; when Saul sent, and they watched the house to kill him.
Deliver me from mine enemies, O my G-d; set me on high from them that rise up against me.
Deliver me from the workers of iniquity, and save me from the men of blood.
For, lo, they lie in wait for my soul; the impudent gather themselves together against me; not for my transgression, nor for my sin, O HaShem.
Without my fault, they run and prepare themselves; awake Thou to help me, and behold.
Thou therefore, O HaShem G-d of hosts, the G-d of Israel, arouse Thyself to punish all the nations; show no mercy to any iniquitous traitors. Selah
They return at evening, they howl like a dog, and go round about the city.
Behold, they belch out with their mouth; swords are in their lips: 'For who doth hear?'
But Thou, O HaShem, shalt laugh at them; Thou shalt have all the nations in derision.
Because of his strength, I will wait for Thee; for G-d is my high tower.
The G-d of my mercy will come to meet me; G-d will let me gaze upon mine adversaries.
Slay them not, lest my people forget, make them wander to and fro by Thy power, and bring them down, O L-rd our shield.
For the sin of their mouth, and the words of their lips, let them even be taken in their pride, and for cursing and lying which they speak.
Consume them in wrath, consume them, that they be no more; and let them know that G-d ruleth in Jacob, unto the ends of the earth. Selah
And they return at evening, they howl like a dog, and go round about the city;
They wander up and down to devour, and tarry all night if they have not their fill.
But as for me, I will sing of Thy strength; yea, I will sing aloud of Thy mercy in the morning; for Thou hast been my high tower, and a refuge in the day of my distress.
O my strength, unto Thee will I sing praises; for G-d is my high tower, the G-d of my mercy.

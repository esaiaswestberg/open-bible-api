A Psalm of David, when he was in the wilderness of Judah.
O G-d, Thou art my G-d, earnestly will I seek Thee; my soul thirsteth for Thee, my flesh longeth for Thee, in a dry and weary land, where no water is.
So have I looked for Thee in the sanctuary, to see Thy power and Thy glory.
For Thy lovingkindness is better than life; my lips shall praise Thee.
So will I bless Thee as long as I live; in Thy name will I lift up my hands.
My soul is satisfied as with marrow and fatness; and my mouth doth praise Thee with joyful lips;
When I remember Thee upon my couch, and meditate on Thee in the night-watches.
For Thou hast been my help, and in the shadow of Thy wings do I rejoice.
My soul cleaveth unto Thee; Thy right hand holdeth me fast.
But those that seek my soul, to destroy it, shall go into the nethermost parts of the earth.
They shall be hurled to the power of the sword; they shall be a portion for foxes.
But the king shall rejoice in G-d; every one that sweareth by Him shall glory; for the mouth of them that speak lies shall be stopped.

A Psalm of the sons of Korah; a Song. His foundation is in the holy mountains.
HaShem loveth the gates of Zion more than all the dwellings of Jacob.
Glorious things are spoken of Thee, O city of G-d. Selah
'I will make mention of Rahab and Babylon as among them that know Me; behold Philistia, and Tyre, with Ethiopia; this one was born there.'
But of Zion it shall be said: 'This man and that was born in her; and the Most High Himself doth establish her.'
HaShem shall count in the register of the peoples: 'This one was born there.' Selah
And whether they sing or dance, all my thoughts are in Thee.

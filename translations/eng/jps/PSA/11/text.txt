For the Leader. A Psalm of David. In HaShem have I taken refuge; how say ye to my soul: 'Flee thou! to your mountain, ye birds'?
For, lo, the wicked bend the bow, they have made ready their arrow upon the string, that they may shoot in darkness at the upright in heart.
When the foundations are destroyed, what hath the righteous wrought?
HaShem is in His holy temple, HaShem, His throne is in heaven; His eyes behold, His eyelids try, the children of men.
HaShem trieth the righteous; but the wicked and him that loveth violence His soul hateth.
Upon the wicked He will cause to rain coals; fire and brimstone and burning wind shall be the portion of their cup.
For HaShem is righteous, He loveth righteousness; the upright shall behold His face.

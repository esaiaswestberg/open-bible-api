I love that HaShem should hear my voice and my supplications.
Because He hath inclined His ear unto me, therefore will I call upon Him all my days.
The cords of death compassed me, and the straits of the nether-world got hold upon me; I found trouble and sorrow.
But I called upon the name of HaShem: 'I beseech thee, O HaShem, deliver my soul.'
Gracious is HaShem, and righteous; yea, our G-d is compassionate.
HaShem preserveth the simple; I was brought low, and He saved me.
Return, O my soul, unto Thy rest; for HaShem hath dealt bountifully with thee.
For thou hast delivered my soul from death, mine eyes from tears, and my feet from stumbling.
I shall walk before HaShem in the lands of the living.
I trusted even when I spoke: 'I am greatly afflicted.'
I said in my haste: 'All men are liars.'
How can I repay unto HaShem all His bountiful dealings toward me?
I will lift up the cup of salvation, and call upon the name of HaShem.
My vows will I pay unto HaShem, yea, in the presence of all His people.
Precious in the sight of HaShem is the death of His saints.
I beseech Thee, O HaShem, for I am Thy servant; I am Thy servant, the son of Thy handmaid; Thou hast loosed my bands.
I will offer to thee the sacrifice of thanksgiving, and will call upon the name of HaShem.
I will pay my vows unto HaShem, yea, in the presence of all His people;
In the courts of HaShem'S house, in the midst of thee, O Jerusalem. Hallelujah.

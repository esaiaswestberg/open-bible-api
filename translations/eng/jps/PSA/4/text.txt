For the Leader; with string-music. A Psalm of David.
Answer me when I call, O G-d of my righteousness, Thou who didst set me free when I was in distress; be gracious unto me, and hear my prayer.
O ye sons of men, how long shall my glory be put to shame, in that ye love vanity, and seek after falsehood? Selah
But know that HaShem hath set apart the godly man as His own; HaShem will hear when I call unto Him.
Tremble, and sin not; commune with your own heart upon your bed, and be still. Selah
Offer the sacrifices of righteousness, and put your trust in HaShem.
Many there are that say: 'Oh that we could see some good!' HaShem, lift Thou up the light of Thy countenance upon us.
Thou hast put gladness in my heart, more than when their corn and their wine increase.
In peace will I both lay me down and sleep; for Thou, HaShem, makest me dwell alone in safety.

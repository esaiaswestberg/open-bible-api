Hallelujah. Praise, O ye servants of HaShem, praise the name of HaShem.
Blessed be the name of HaShem from this time forth and for ever.
From the rising of the sun unto the going down thereof HaShem'S name is to be praised.
HaShem is high above all nations, His glory is above the heavens.
Who is like unto HaShem our G-d, that is enthroned on high,
That looketh down low upon heaven and upon the earth?
Who raiseth up the poor out of the dust, and lifteth up the needy out of the dunghill;
That He may set him with princes, even with the princes of His people.
Who maketh the barren woman to dwell in her house as a joyful mother of children. Hallelujah.

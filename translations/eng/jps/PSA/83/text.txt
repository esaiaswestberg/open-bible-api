A Song, a Psalm of Asaph.
O G-d, keep not Thou silence; hold not Thy peace, and be not still, O G-d.
For, lo, Thine enemies are in an uproar; and they that hate Thee have lifted up the head.
They hold crafty converse against Thy people, and take counsel against Thy treasured ones.
They have said: 'Come, and let us cut them off from being a nation; that the name of Israel may be no more in remembrance.'
For they have consulted together with one consent; against Thee do they make a covenant;
The tents of Edom and the Ishmaelites; Moab, and the Hagrites;
Gebal, and Ammon, and Amalek; Philistia with the inhabitants of Tyre;
Assyria also is joined with them; they have been an arm to the children of Lot. Selah
Do Thou unto them as unto Midian; as to Sisera, as to Jabin, at the brook Kishon;
Who were destroyed at En-dor; they became as dung for the earth.
Make their nobles like Oreb and Zeeb, and like Zebah and Zalmunna all their princes;
Who said: 'Let us take to ourselves in possession the habitations of G-d.'
O my G-d, make them like the whirling dust; as stubble before the wind.
As the fire that burneth the forest, and as the flame that setteth the mountains ablaze;
So pursue them with Thy tempest, and affright them with Thy storm.
Fill their faces with shame; that they may seek Thy name, O HaShem.
Let them be ashamed and affrighted for ever; yea, let them be abashed and perish;
That they may know that it is Thou alone whose name is HaShem, the Most High over all the earth.

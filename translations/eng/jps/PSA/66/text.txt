For the Leader. A Song, a Psalm. Shout unto G-d, all the earth;
Sing praises unto the glory of His name; make His praise glorious.
Say unto G-d: 'How tremendous is Thy work! Through the greatness of Thy power shall Thine enemies dwindle away before Thee.
All the earth shall worship Thee, and shall sing praises unto Thee; they shall sing praises to Thy name.' Selah
Come, and see the works of G-d; He is terrible in His doing toward the children of men.
He turned the sea into dry land; they went through the river on foot; there let us rejoice in Him!
Who ruleth by His might for ever; His eyes keep watch upon the nations; let not the rebellious exalt themselves. Selah
Bless our G-d, ye peoples, and make the voice of His praise to be heard;
Who hath set our soul in life, and suffered not our foot to be moved,
For Thou, O G-d, hast tried us; Thou hast refined us, as silver is refined.
Thou didst bring us into the hold; Thou didst lay constraint upon our loins.
Thou hast caused men to ride over our heads; we went through fire and through water; but Thou didst bring us out unto abundance.
I will come into Thy house with burnt-offerings, I will perform unto Thee my vows,
Which my lips have uttered, and my mouth hath spoken, when I was in distress.
I will offer unto Thee burnt-offerings of fatlings, with the sweet smoke of rams; I will offer bullocks with goats. Selah
Come, and hearken, all ye that fear G-d, and I will declare what He hath done for my soul.
I cried unto Him with my mouth, and He was extolled with my tongue.
If I had regarded iniquity in my heart, the L-rd would not hear;
But verily G-d hath heard; He hath attended to the voice of my prayer.
Blessed be G-d, who hath not turned away my prayer, nor His mercy from me.

A Song of Ascents; of Solomon. Except HaShem build the house, they labour in vain that build it; except HaShem keep the city, the watchman waketh but in vain.
It is vain for you that ye rise early, and sit up late, ye that eat the bread of toil; so He giveth unto His beloved in sleep.
Lo, children are a heritage of HaShem; the fruit of the womb is a reward.
As arrows in the hand of a mighty man, so are the children of one's youth.
Happy is the man that hath his quiver full of them; they shall not be put to shame, when they speak with their enemies in the gate.

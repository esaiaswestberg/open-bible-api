For the Leader; for Jeduthun. A Psalm of David.
Only for G-d doth my soul wait in stillness; from Him cometh my salvation.
He only is my rock and my salvation, my high tower, I shall not be greatly moved.
How long will ye set upon a man, that ye may slay him, all of you, as a leaning wall, a tottering fence?
They only devise to thrust him down from his height, delighting in lies; they bless with their mouth, but they curse inwardly. Selah
Only for G-d wait thou in stillness, my soul; for from Him cometh my hope.
He only is my rock and my salvation, my high tower, I shall not be moved.
Upon G-d resteth my salvation and my glory; the rock of my strength, and my refuge, is in G-d.
Trust in Him at all times, ye people; pour out your heart before Him; G-d is a refuge for us. Selah
Men of low degree are vanity, and men of high degree are a lie; if they be laid in the balances, they are together lighter than vanity.
Trust not in oppression, and put not vain hope in robbery; if riches increase, set not your heart thereon.
G-d hath spoken once, twice have I heard this: that strength belongeth unto G-d;
Also unto Thee, O L-rd, belongeth mercy; for Thou renderest to every man according to his work.

And HaShem spoke unto Moses, saying:
Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them: The appointed seasons of HaShem, which ye shall proclaim to be holy convocations, even these are My appointed seasons.
Six days shall work be done; but on the seventh day is a sabbath of solemn rest, a holy convocation; ye shall do no manner of work; it is a sabbath unto HaShem in all your dwellings.
These are the appointed seasons of HaShem, even holy convocations, which ye shall proclaim in their appointed season.
In the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month at dusk, is HaShem'S passover.
And on the fifteenth day of the same month is the feast of unleavened bread unto HaShem; seven days ye shall eat unleavened bread.
In the first day ye shall have a holy convocation; ye shall do no manner of servile work.
And ye shall bring an offering made by fire unto HaShem seven days; in the seventh day is a holy convocation; ye shall do no manner of servile work.
And HaShem spoke unto Moses saying:
Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them: When ye are come into the land which I give unto you, and shall reap the harvest thereof, then ye shall bring the sheaf of the first-fruits of your harvest unto the priest.
And he shall wave the sheaf before HaShem, to be accepted for you; on the morrow after the sabbath the priest shall wave it.
And in the day when ye wave the sheaf, ye shall offer a he-lamb without blemish of the first year for a burnt-offering unto HaShem.
And the meal-offering thereof shall be two tenth parts of an ephah of fine flour mingled with oil, an offering made by fire unto HaShem for a sweet savour; and the drink-offering thereof shall be of wine, the fourth part of a hin.
And ye shall eat neither bread, nor parched corn, nor fresh ears, until this selfsame day, until ye have brought the offering of your G-d; it is a statute for ever throughout your generations in all your dwellings.
And ye shall count unto you from the morrow after the day of rest, from the day that ye brought the sheaf of the waving; seven weeks shall there be complete;
even unto the morrow after the seventh week shall ye number fifty days; and ye shall present a new meal-offering unto HaShem.
Ye shall bring out of your dwellings two wave-loaves of two tenth parts of an ephah; they shall be of fine flour, they shall be baked with leaven, for first-fruits unto HaShem.
And ye shall present with the bread seven lambs without blemish of the first year, and one young bullock, and two rams; they shall be a burnt-offering unto HaShem, with their meal-offering, and their drink-offerings, even an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto HaShem.
And ye shall offer one he-goat for a sin-offering, and two he-lambs of the first year for a sacrifice of peace-offerings.
And the priest shall wave them with the bread of the first-fruits for a wave-offering before HaShem, with the two lambs; they shall be holy to HaShem for the priest.
And ye shall make proclamation on the selfsame day; there shall be a holy convocation unto you; ye shall do no manner of servile work; it is a statute for ever in all your dwellings throughout your generations.
And when ye reap the harvest of your land, thou shalt not wholly reap the corner of thy field, neither shalt thou gather the gleaning of thy harvest; thou shalt leave them for the poor, and for the stranger: I am HaShem your G-d.
And HaShem spoke unto Moses, saying:
Speak unto the children of Israel, saying: In the seventh month, in the first day of the month, shall be a solemn rest unto you, a memorial proclaimed with the blast of horns, a holy convocation.
Ye shall do no manner of servile work; and ye shall bring an offering made by fire unto HaShem.
And HaShem spoke unto Moses, saying:
Howbeit on the tenth day of this seventh month is the day of atonement; there shall be a holy convocation unto you, and ye shall afflict your souls; and ye shall bring an offering made by fire unto HaShem.
And ye shall do no manner of work in that same day; for it is a day of atonement, to make atonement for you before HaShem your G-d.
For whatsoever soul it be that shall not be afflicted in that same day, he shall be cut off from his people.
And whatsoever soul it be that doeth any manner of work in that same day, that soul will I destroy from among his people.
Ye shall do no manner of work; it is a statute for ever throughout your generations in all your dwellings.
It shall be unto you a sabbath of solemn rest, and ye shall afflict your souls; in the ninth day of the month at even, from even unto even, shall ye keep your sabbath.
And HaShem spoke unto Moses, saying:
Speak unto the children of Israel, saying: On the fifteenth day of this seventh month is the feast of tabernacles for seven days unto HaShem.
On the first day shall be a holy convocation; ye shall do no manner of servile work.
Seven days ye shall bring an offering made by fire unto HaShem; on the eighth day shall be a holy convocation unto you; and ye shall bring an offering made by fire unto HaShem; it is a day of solemn assembly; ye shall do no manner of servile work.
These are the appointed seasons of HaShem, which ye shall proclaim to be holy convocations, to bring an offering made by fire unto HaShem, a burnt-offering, and a meal-offering, a sacrifice, and drink-offerings, each on its own day;
beside the sabbaths of HaShem, and beside your gifts, and beside all your vows, and beside all your freewill-offerings, which ye give unto HaShem.
Howbeit on the fifteenth day of the seventh month, when ye have gathered in the fruits of the land, ye shall keep the feast of HaShem seven days; on the first day shall be a solemn rest, and on the eighth day shall be a solemn rest.
And ye shall take you on the first day the fruit of goodly trees, branches of palm-trees, and boughs of thick trees, and willows of the brook, and ye shall rejoice before HaShem your G-d seven days.
And ye shall keep it a feast unto HaShem seven days in the year; it is a statute for ever in your generations; ye shall keep it in the seventh month.
Ye shall dwell in booths seven days; all that are home-born in Israel shall dwell in booths;
that your generations may know that I made the children of Israel to dwell in booths, when I brought them out of the land of Egypt: I am HaShem your G-d.
And Moses declared unto the children of Israel the appointed seasons of HaShem.

And HaShem said unto me: 'Go yet, love a woman beloved of her friend and an adulteress, even as HaShem loveth the children of Israel, though they turn unto other gods, and love cakes of raisins.
So I bought her to me for fifteen pieces of silver and a homer of barley, and a half-homer of barley;
and I said unto her: 'Thou shalt sit solitary for me many days; thou shalt not play the harlot, and thou shalt not be any man's wife; nor will I be thine.'
For the children of Israel shall sit solitary many days without king, and without prince, and without sacrifice, and without pillar, and without ephod or teraphim;
afterward shall the children of Israel return, and seek HaShem their G-d, and David their king; and shall come trembling unto HaShem and to His goodness in the end of days.

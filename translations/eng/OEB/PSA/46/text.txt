God is our refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble.
So we have no fear, though earth should change, and the hills totter into the heart of the ocean.
Let its waters roar and foam, let the mountains shake with the swelling thereof. On our side is the Lord of hosts, our sure defence is the God of Jacob. (Selah)
A river there is, whose streams make glad God’s city, the home the Most High has hallowed.
God is within her: she cannot be shaken. God helps her at the turn of the morning.
Nations roared, kingdoms tottered: he uttered his voice, earth melted away.
On our side is the Lord of hosts, our sure defence is the God of Jacob.
Come and see what the Lord has done, working appallingly in the earth.
He stills wars to the ends of the earth- breaking the bow, snapping the spear, burning the chariots in the fire.
“Refrain; and know surely that I am God, high over the nations, high over the world.”
On our side is the Lord of Hosts, our sure defence is the God of Jacob. (Selah)

Elihu spoke moreover, and said,

I will answer you, and your companions with you.
Look to the heavens, and see; and behold the clouds which are higher than you.
If you sin, what do you against him? or if your transgressions be multiplied, what do you to him?
If you be righteous, what give you him? or what receives he of your hand?

Who teaches us more than the beasts of the earth, and makes us wiser than the fowls of heaven?
There they cry, but none gives answer, because of the pride of evil men.

Although you say you shall not see him, yet judgment is before him; therefore trust you in him.
But now, because it is not so, he has visited in his anger; yet he knows it not in great extremity:
Therefore does Job open his mouth in vain; he multiplies words without knowledge.

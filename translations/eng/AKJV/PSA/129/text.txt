Many a time have they afflicted me from my youth, may Israel now say:
Many a time have they afflicted me from my youth: yet they have not prevailed against me.
The plowers plowed on my back: they made long their furrows.
The LORD is righteous: he has cut asunder the cords of the wicked.
Let them all be confounded and turned back that hate Zion.
Let them be as the grass on the housetops, which wither before it grows up:
With which the mower fills not his hand; nor he that binds sheaves his bosom.
Neither do they which go by say, The blessing of the LORD be on you: we bless you in the name of the LORD.

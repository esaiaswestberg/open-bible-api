Give to the LORD, O you mighty, give to the LORD glory and strength.
Give to the LORD the glory due to his name; worship the LORD in the beauty of holiness.
The voice of the LORD is on the waters: the God of glory thunders: the LORD is on many waters.
The voice of the LORD is powerful; the voice of the LORD is full of majesty.
The voice of the LORD breaks the cedars; yes, the LORD breaks the cedars of Lebanon.
He makes them also to skip like a calf; Lebanon and Sirion like a young unicorn.
The voice of the LORD divides the flames of fire.
The voice of the LORD shakes the wilderness; the LORD shakes the wilderness of Kadesh.
The voice of the LORD makes the hinds to calve, and discovers the forests: and in his temple does every one speak of his glory.
The LORD sits on the flood; yes, the LORD sits King for ever.
The LORD will give strength to his people; the LORD will bless his people with peace.

Make a joyful noise to God, all you lands:
Sing forth the honor of his name: make his praise glorious.
Say to God, How terrible are you in your works! through the greatness of your power shall your enemies submit themselves to you.
All the earth shall worship you, and shall sing to you; they shall sing to your name. Selah.
Come and see the works of God: he is terrible in his doing toward the children of men.
He turned the sea into dry land: they went through the flood on foot: there did we rejoice in him.
He rules by his power for ever; his eyes behold the nations: let not the rebellious exalt themselves. Selah.
O bless our God, you people, and make the voice of his praise to be heard:
Which holds our soul in life, and suffers not our feet to be moved.
For you, O God, have proved us: you have tried us, as silver is tried.
You brought us into the net; you laid affliction on our loins.
You have caused men to ride over our heads; we went through fire and through water: but you brought us out into a wealthy place.
I will go into your house with burnt offerings: I will pay you my vows,
Which my lips have uttered, and my mouth has spoken, when I was in trouble.
I will offer to you burnt sacrifices of fatted calves, with the incense of rams; I will offer bullocks with goats. Selah.
Come and hear, all you that fear God, and I will declare what he has done for my soul.
I cried to him with my mouth, and he was extolled with my tongue.
If I regard iniquity in my heart, the Lord will not hear me:
But truly God has heard me; he has attended to the voice of my prayer.
Blessed be God, which has not turned away my prayer, nor his mercy from me.

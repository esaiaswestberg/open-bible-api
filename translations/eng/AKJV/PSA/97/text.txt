The LORD reigns; let the earth rejoice; let the multitude of isles be glad thereof.
Clouds and darkness are round about him: righteousness and judgment are the habitation of his throne.
A fire goes before him, and burns up his enemies round about.
His lightning enlightened the world: the earth saw, and trembled.
The hills melted like wax at the presence of the LORD, at the presence of the Lord of the whole earth.
The heavens declare his righteousness, and all the people see his glory.
Confounded be all they that serve graven images, that boast themselves of idols: worship him, all you gods.
Zion heard, and was glad; and the daughters of Judah rejoiced because of your judgments, O LORD.
For you, LORD, are high above all the earth: you are exalted far above all gods.
You that love the LORD, hate evil: he preserves the souls of his saints; he delivers them out of the hand of the wicked.
Light is sown for the righteous, and gladness for the upright in heart.
Rejoice in the LORD, you righteous; and give thanks at the remembrance of his holiness.

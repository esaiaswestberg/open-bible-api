In my distress I cried to the LORD, and he heard me.
Deliver my soul, O LORD, from lying lips, and from a deceitful tongue.
What shall be given to you? or what shall be done to you, you false tongue?
Sharp arrows of the mighty, with coals of juniper.
Woe is me, that I sojourn in Mesech, that I dwell in the tents of Kedar!
My soul has long dwelled with him that hates peace.
I am for peace: but when I speak, they are for war.

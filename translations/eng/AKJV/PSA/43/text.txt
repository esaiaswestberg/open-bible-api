Judge me, O God, and plead my cause against an ungodly nation: O deliver me from the deceitful and unjust man.
For you are the God of my strength: why do you cast me off? why go I mourning because of the oppression of the enemy?
O send out your light and your truth: let them lead me; let them bring me to your holy hill, and to your tabernacles.
Then will I go to the altar of God, to God my exceeding joy: yes, on the harp will I praise you, O God my God.
Why are you cast down, O my soul? and why are you disquieted within me? hope in God: for I shall yet praise him, who is the health of my countenance, and my God.

Give ear to my words, O LORD, consider my meditation.
Listen to the voice of my cry, my King, and my God: for to you will I pray.
My voice shall you hear in the morning, O LORD; in the morning will I direct my prayer to you, and will look up.
For you are not a God that has pleasure in wickedness: neither shall evil dwell with you.
The foolish shall not stand in your sight: you hate all workers of iniquity.
You shall destroy them that speak leasing: the LORD will abhor the bloody and deceitful man.
But as for me, I will come into your house in the multitude of your mercy: and in your fear will I worship toward your holy temple.
Lead me, O LORD, in your righteousness because of my enemies; make your way straight before my face.
For there is no faithfulness in their mouth; their inward part is very wickedness; their throat is an open sepulcher; they flatter with their tongue.
Destroy you them, O God; let them fall by their own counsels; cast them out in the multitude of their transgressions; for they have rebelled against you.
But let all those that put their trust in you rejoice: let them ever shout for joy, because you defend them: let them also that love your name be joyful in you.
For you, LORD, will bless the righteous; with favor will you compass him as with a shield.

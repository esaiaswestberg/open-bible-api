God stands in the congregation of the mighty; he judges among the gods.
How long will you judge unjustly, and accept the persons of the wicked? Selah.
Defend the poor and fatherless: do justice to the afflicted and needy.
Deliver the poor and needy: rid them out of the hand of the wicked.
They know not, neither will they understand; they walk on in darkness: all the foundations of the earth are out of course.
I have said, You are gods; and all of you are children of the most High.
But you shall die like men, and fall like one of the princes.
Arise, O God, judge the earth: for you shall inherit all nations.

And king Solomon was king over all Israel.
And these were the princes whom he had: Azariah the son of Zadok, the priest;
Elihoreph and Ahijah, the sons of Shisha, scribes; Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud, the recorder;
and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the host; and Zadok and Abiathar were priests;
and Azariah the son of Nathan was over the officers; and Zabud the son of Nathan was chief minister and the king's friend;
and Ahishar was over the household; and Adoniram the son of Abda was over the levy.
And Solomon had twelve officers over all Israel, who provided victuals for the king and his household: each man had to make provision for a month in the year.
And these are their names: The son of Hur, in the hill-country of Ephraim;
the son of Deker, in Makaz, and in Shaalbim, and Beth-shemesh, and Elon-beth-hanan;
the son of Hesed, in Arubboth; to him pertained Socoh, and all the land of Hepher;
the son of Abinadab, in all the region of Dor; he had Taphath the daughter of Solomon to wife;
Baana the son of Ahilud, in Taanach and Megiddo, and all Beth-shean which is beside Zarethan, beneath Jezreel, from Beth-shean to Abel-meholah, as far as beyond Jokmeam;
the son of Geber, in Ramoth-gilead; to him pertained the villages of Jair the son of Manasseh, which are in Gilead; even to him pertained the region of Argob, which is in Bashan, threescore great cities with walls and brazen bars;
Ahinadab the son of Iddo, in Mahanaim;
Ahimaaz, in Naphtali; he also took Basemath the daughter of Solomon to wife;
Baana the son of Hushai, in Asher and Bealoth;

Judah and Israel were many, as the sand which is by the sea in multitude, eating and drinking and making merry.

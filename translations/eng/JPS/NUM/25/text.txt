And Israel abode in Shittim, and the people began to commit harlotry with the daughters of Moab.
And they called the people unto the sacrifices of their gods; and the people did eat, and bowed down to their gods.
And Israel joined himself unto the Baal of Peor; and the anger of HaShem was kindled against Israel.
And HaShem said unto Moses: 'Take all the chiefs of the people, and hang them up unto HaShem in face of the sun, that the fierce anger of HaShem may turn away from Israel.'
And Moses said unto the judges of Israel: 'Slay ye every one his men that have joined themselves unto the Baal of Peor.'
And, behold, one of the children of Israel came and brought unto his brethren a Midianitish woman in the sight of Moses, and in the sight of all the congregation of the children of Israel, while they were weeping at the door of the tent of meeting.
And when Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest, saw it, he rose up from the midst of the congregation, and took a spear in his hand.

And the name of the Midianitish woman that was slain was Cozbi, the daughter of Zur; he was head of the people of a fathers' house in Midian.
And HaShem spoke unto Moses, saying:
'Harass the Midianites, and smite them;
for they harass you, by their wiles wherewith they have beguiled you in the matter of Peor, and in the matter of Cozbi, the daughter of the prince of Midian, their sister, who was slain on the day of the plague in the matter of Peor.'

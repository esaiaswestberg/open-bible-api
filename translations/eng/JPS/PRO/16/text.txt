All the ways of a man are clean in his own eyes; but HaShem weigheth the spirits.

It is an abomination to kings to commit wickedness; for the throne is established by righteousness.
Righteous lips are the delight of kings; and they love him that speaketh right.

How much better is it to get wisdom than gold! yea, to get understanding is rather to be chosen than silver.
The highway of the upright is to depart from evil; he that keepeth his way preserveth his soul.
Pride goeth before destruction, and a haughty spirit before a fall.

The heart of the wise teacheth his mouth, and addeth learning to his lips.
Pleasant words are as a honeycomb, sweet to the soul, and health to the bones.
There is a way which seemeth right unto a man, but the end thereof are the ways of death.

An ungodly man diggeth up evil, and in his lips there is as a burning fire.
A froward man soweth strife; and a whisperer separateth familiar friends.
A man of violence enticeth his neighbour, and leadeth him into a way that is not good.
He that shutteth his eyes, it is to devise froward things; he that biteth his lips bringeth evil to pass.
The hoary head is a crown of glory, it is found in the way of righteousness.
He that is slow to anger is better than the mighty; and he that ruleth his spirit than he that taketh a city.
The lot is cast into the lap; but the whole disposing thereof is of HaShem.

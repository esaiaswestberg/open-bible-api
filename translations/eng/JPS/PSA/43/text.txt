Be Thou my judge, O G-d, and plead my cause against an ungodly nation; O deliver me from the deceitful and unjust man.
For Thou art the G-d of my strength; why hast Thou cast me off? Why go I mourning under the oppression of the enemy?
O send out Thy light and Thy truth; let them lead me; let them bring me unto Thy holy mountain, and to Thy dwelling-places.
Then will I go unto the altar of G-d, unto G-d, my exceeding joy; and praise Thee upon the harp, O G-d, my G-d.
Why art thou cast down, O my soul? and why moanest thou within me? Hope thou in G-d; for I shall yet praise Him, the salvation of my countenance, and my G-d.

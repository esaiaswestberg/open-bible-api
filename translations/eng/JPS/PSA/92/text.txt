A Psalm, a Song. For the sabbath day.
It is a good thing to give thanks unto HaShem, and to sing praises unto Thy name, O Most High;
To declare Thy lovingkindness in the morning, and Thy faithfulness in the night seasons,
With an instrument of ten strings, and with the psaltery; with a solemn sound upon the harp.
For Thou, HaShem, hast made me glad through Thy work; I will exult in the works of Thy hands.
How great are Thy works, O HaShem! Thy thoughts are very deep.
A brutish man knoweth not, neither doth a fool understand this.
When the wicked spring up as the grass, and when all the workers of iniquity do flourish; it is that they may be destroyed for ever.
But Thou, O HaShem, art on high for evermore.
For, lo, Thine enemies, O HaShem, for, lo, Thine enemies shall perish: all the workers of iniquity shall be scattered.
But my horn hast Thou exalted like the horn of the wild-ox; I am anointed with rich oil.
Mine eye also hath gazed on them that lie in wait for me, mine ears have heard my desire of the evil-doers that rise up against me.
The righteous shall flourish like the palm-tree; he shall grow like a cedar in Lebanon.
Planted in the house of HaShem, they shall flourish in the courts of our G-d.
They shall still bring forth fruit in old age; they shall be full of sap and richness;
To declare that HaShem is upright, my Rock, in whom there is no unrighteousness.

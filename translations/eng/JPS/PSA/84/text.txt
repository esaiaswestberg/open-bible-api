For the Leader; upon the Gittith. A Psalm of the sons of Korah.
How lovely are Thy tabernacles, O HaShem of hosts!
My soul yearneth, yea, even pineth for the courts of HaShem; my heart and my flesh sing for joy unto the living G-d.
Yea, the sparrow hath found a house, and the swallow a nest for herself, where she may lay her young; Thine altars, O HaShem of hosts, my King, and my G-d--.
Happy are they that dwell in Thy house, they are ever praising Thee. Selah
Happy is the man whose strength is in Thee; in whose heart are the highways.
Passing through the valley of Baca they make it a place of springs; yea, the early rain clotheth it with blessings.
They go from strength to strength, every one of them appeareth before G-d in Zion.
O HaShem G-d of hosts, hear my prayer; give ear, O G-d of Jacob. Selah
Behold, O G-d our shield, and look upon the face of Thine anointed.
For a day in Thy courts is better than a thousand; I had rather stand at the threshold of the house of my G-d, than to dwell in the tents of wickedness.
For HaShem G-d is a sun and a shield; HaShem giveth grace and glory; no good thing will He withhold from them that walk uprightly.
O HaShem of hosts, happy is the man that trusteth in Thee.

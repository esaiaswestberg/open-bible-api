Hallelujah. Praise ye HaShem from the heavens; praise Him in the heights.
Praise ye Him, all His angels; praise ye Him, all His hosts.
Praise ye Him, sun and moon; praise Him, all ye stars of light.
Praise Him, ye heavens of heavens, and ye waters that are above the heavens.
Let them praise the name of HaShem; for He commanded, and they were created.
He hath also established them for ever and ever; He hath made a decree which shall not be transgressed.
Praise HaShem from the earth, ye sea-monsters, and all deeps;
Fire and hail, snow and vapour, stormy wind, fulfilling His word;
Mountains and all hills, fruitful trees and all cedars;
Beasts and all cattle, creeping things and winged fowl;
Kings of the earth and all peoples, princes and all judges of the earth;
Both young men and maidens, old men and children;
Let them praise the name of HaShem, for His name alone is exalted; His glory is above the earth and heaven.
And He hath lifted up a horn for His people, a praise for all His saints, even for the children of Israel, a people near unto Him. Hallelujah.

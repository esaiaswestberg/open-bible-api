A Psalm. O sing unto HaShem a new song; for He hath done marvellous things; His right hand, and His holy arm, hath wrought salvation for Him.
HaShem hath made known His salvation; His righteousness hath He revealed in the sight of the nations.
He hath remembered His mercy and His faithfulness toward the house of Israel; all the ends of the earth have seen the salvation of our G-d.
Shout unto HaShem, all the earth; break forth and sing for joy, yea, sing praises.
Sing praises unto HaShem with the harp; with the harp and the voice of melody.
With trumpets and sound of the horn shout ye before the King, HaShem.
Let the sea roar, and the fulness thereof; the world, and they that dwell therein;
Let the floods clap their hands; let the mountains sing for joy together;
Before HaShem, for He is come to judge the earth; He will judge the world with righteousness, and the peoples with equity.

A Prayer of David. Incline Thine ear, O HaShem, and answer me; for I am poor and needy.
Keep my soul, for I am godly; O Thou my G-d, save Thy servant that trusteth in Thee.
Be gracious unto me, O L-rd; for unto Thee do I cry all the day.
Rejoice the soul of Thy servant; for unto Thee, O L-rd, do I lift up my soul.
For Thou, L-rd, art good, and ready to pardon, and plenteous in mercy unto all them that call upon Thee.
Give ear, O HaShem, unto my prayer; and attend unto the voice of my supplications.
In the day of my trouble I call upon Thee; for Thou wilt answer me.
There is none like unto Thee among the gods, O L-rd, and there are no works like Thine.
All nations whom Thou hast made shall come and prostrate themselves before Thee, O L-rd; and they shall glorify Thy name.
For Thou art great, and doest wondrous things; Thou art G-d alone.
Teach me, O HaShem, Thy way, that I may walk in Thy truth; make one my heart to fear Thy name.
I will thank Thee, O L-rd my G-d, with my whole heart; and I will glorify Thy name for evermore.
For great is Thy mercy toward me; and Thou hast delivered my soul from the lowest nether-world.
O G-d, the proud are risen up against me, and the company of violent men have sought after my soul, and have not set Thee before them.
But Thou, O L-rd, art a G-d full of compassion and gracious, slow to anger, and plenteous in mercy and truth.
O turn unto me, and be gracious unto me; give Thy strength unto Thy servant, and save the son of Thy handmaid.
Work in my behalf a sign for good; that they that hate me may see it, and be put to shame, because Thou, HaShem, hast helped me, and comforted me.

For the Leader. A Psalm of David.
The heavens declare the glory of G-d, and the firmament showeth His handiwork;
Day unto day uttereth speech, and night unto night revealeth knowledge;
There is no speech, there are no words, neither is their voice heard.
Their line is gone out through all the earth, and their words to the end of the world. In them hath He set a tent for the sun,
Which is as a bridegroom coming out of his chamber, and rejoiceth as a strong man to run his course.
His going forth is from the end of the heaven, and his circuit unto the ends of it; and there is nothing hid from the heat thereof.
The law of HaShem is perfect, restoring the soul; the testimony of HaShem is sure, making wise the simple.
The precepts of HaShem are right, rejoicing the heart; the commandment of HaShem is pure, enlightening the eyes.
The fear of HaShem is clean, enduring for ever; the ordinances of HaShem are true, they are righteous altogether;
More to be desired are they than gold, yea, than much fine gold; sweeter also than honey and the honeycomb.
Moreover by them is Thy servant warned; in keeping of them there is great reward.
Who can discern his errors? Clear Thou me from hidden faults.
Keep back Thy servant also from presumptuous sins, that they may not have dominion over me; then shall I be faultless, and I shall be clear from great transgression.
Let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be acceptable before Thee, O HaShem, my Rock, and my Redeemer.

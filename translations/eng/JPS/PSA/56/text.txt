For the Leader; upon Jonath-elem-rehokim. A Psalm of David; Michtam; when the Philistines took him in Gath.
Be gracious unto me, O G-d, for man would swallow me up; all the day he fighting oppresseth me.
They that lie in wait for me would swallow me up all the day; for they are many that fight against me, O Most High,
In the day that I am afraid, I will put my trust in Thee.
In G-d--I will praise His word--in G-d do I trust, I will not be afraid; what can flesh do unto me?
All the day they trouble mine affairs; all their thoughts are against me for evil.
They gather themselves together, they hide themselves, they mark my steps; according as they have waited for my soul.
Because of iniquity cast them out; in anger bring down the peoples, O G-d.
Thou has counted my wanderings; put Thou my tears into Thy bottle; are they not in Thy book?
Then shall mine enemies turn back in the day that I call; this I know, that G-d is for me.
In G-d--I will praise His word--in HaShem--I will praise His word--
In G-d do I trust, I will not be afraid; what can man do unto me?
Thy vows are upon me, O G-d; I will render thank-offerings unto Thee.
For thou hast delivered my soul from death; hast Thou not delivered my feet from stumbling? that I may walk before G-d in the light of the living?

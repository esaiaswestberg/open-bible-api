A Psalm of David. Judge me, O HaShem, for I have walked in mine integrity, and I have trusted in HaShem without wavering.
Examine me, O HaShem, and try me; test my reins and my heart.
For Thy mercy is before mine eyes; and I have walked in Thy truth.
I have not sat with men of falsehood; neither will I go in with dissemblers.
I hate the gathering of evil doers, and will not sit with the wicked.
I will wash my hands in innocency; so will I compass Thine altar, O HaShem,
That I may make the voice of thanksgiving to be heard, and tell of all Thy wondrous works.
HaShem, I love the habitation of Thy house, and the place where Thy glory dwelleth.
Gather not my soul with sinners, nor my life with men of blood;
In whose hands is craftiness, and their right hand is full of bribes.
But as for me, I will walk in mine integrity; redeem me, and be gracious unto me.
My foot standeth in an even place; in the congregations will I bless HaShem.

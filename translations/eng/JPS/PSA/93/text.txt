HaShem reigneth; He is clothed in majesty; HaShem is clothed, He hath girded Himself with strength; yea, the world is established, that it cannot be moved.
Thy throne is established of old; Thou art from everlasting.
The floods have lifted up, O HaShem, the floods have lifted up their voice; the floods lift up their roaring.
Above the voices of many waters, the mighty breakers of the sea, HaShem on high is mighty.
Thy testimonies are very sure, holiness becometh Thy house, O HaShem, for evermore.

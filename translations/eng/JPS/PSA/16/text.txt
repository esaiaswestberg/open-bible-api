Michtam of David. Keep me, O G-d; for I have taken refuge in Thee.
I have said unto HaShem: 'Thou art my L-rd; I have no good but in Thee';
As for the holy that are in the earth, they are the excellent in whom is all my delight.
Let the idols of them be multiplied that make suit unto another; their drink-offerings of blood will I not offer, nor take their names upon my lips.
O HaShem, the portion of mine inheritance and of my cup, Thou maintainest my lot.
The lines are fallen unto me in pleasant places; yea, I have a goodly heritage.
I will bless HaShem, who hath given me counsel; yea, in the night seasons my reins instruct me.
I have set HaShem always before me; surely He is at my right hand, I shall not be moved.
Therefore my heart is glad, and my glory rejoiceth; my flesh also dwelleth in safety;
For Thou wilt not abandon my soul to the nether-world; neither wilt Thou suffer Thy godly one to see the pit.
Thou makest me to know the path of life; in Thy presence is fulness of joy, in Thy right hand bliss for evermore.

A Song of Ascents; of David. HaShem, my heart is not haughty, nor mine eyes lofty; neither do I exercise myself in things too great, or in things too wonderful for me.
Surely I have stilled and quieted my soul; like a weaned child with his mother; my soul is with me like a weaned child.
O Israel, hope in HaShem from this time forth and for ever.

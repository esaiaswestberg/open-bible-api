For the Leader; upon Shushan Eduth; Michtam of David, to teach;
when he strove with Aram-naharaim and with Aram-zobah, and Joab returned, and smote of Edom in the Valley of Salt twelve thousand.
O G-d, Thou hast cast us off, Thou hast broken us down; Thou hast been angry; O restore us.
Thou hast made the land to shake, Thou hast cleft it; heal the breaches thereof; for it tottereth.
Thou hast made Thy people to see hard things; Thou hast made us to drink the wine of staggering.
Thou hast given a banner to them that fear Thee, that it may be displayed because of the truth. Selah
That Thy beloved may be delivered, save with Thy right hand, and answer me.
G-d spoke in His holiness, that I would exult; that I would divide Shechem, and mete out the valley of Succoth.
Gilead is mine, and Manasseh is mine; Ephraim also is the defence of my head; Judah is my sceptre.
Moab is my washpot; upon Edom do I cast my shoe; Philistia, cry aloud because of me!
Who will bring me into the fortified city? Who will lead me unto Edom?
Hast not Thou, O G-d, cast us off? And Thou goest not forth, O G-d, with our hosts.
Give us help against the adversary; for vain is the help of man.
Through G-d we shall do valiantly; for He it is that will tread down our adversaries.

A Song of Ascents. HaShem, remember unto David all his affliction;
How he swore unto HaShem, and vowed unto the Mighty One of Jacob:
'Surely I will not come into the tent of my house, nor go up into the bed that is spread for me;
I will not give sleep to mine eyes, nor slumber to mine eyelids;
Until I find out a place for HaShem, a dwelling-place for the Mighty One of Jacob.'
Lo, we heard of it as being in Ephrath; we found it in the field of the wood.
Let us go into His dwelling-place; let us worship at His footstool.
Arise, O HaShem, unto Thy resting-place; Thou, and the ark of Thy strength.
Let Thy priests be clothed with righteousness; and let Thy saints shout for joy.
For Thy servant David's sake turn not away the face of Thine anointed.
HaShem swore unto David in truth; He will not turn back from it: 'Of the fruit of thy body will I set upon thy throne.
If thy children keep My covenant and My testimony that I shall teach them, their children also for ever shall sit upon thy throne.'
For HaShem hath chosen Zion; He hath desired it for His habitation:
'This is My resting-place for ever; here will I dwell; for I have desired it.
I will abundantly bless her provision; I will give her needy bread in plenty.
Her priests also will I clothe with salvation; and her saints shall shout aloud for joy.
There will I make a horn to shoot up unto David, there have I ordered a lamp for Mine anointed.
His enemies will I clothe with shame; but upon himself shall his crown shine.'

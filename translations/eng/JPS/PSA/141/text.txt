A Psalm of David. HaShem, I have called Thee; make haste unto me; give ear unto my voice, when I call unto Thee.
Let my prayer be set forth as incense before Thee, the lifting up of my hands as the evening sacrifice.
Set a guard, O HaShem, to my mouth; keep watch at the door of my lips.
Incline not my heart to any evil thing, to be occupied in deeds of wickedness with men that work iniquity; and let me not eat of their dainties.
Let the righteous smite me in kindness, and correct me; oil so choice let not my head refuse; for still is my prayer because of their wickedness.
Their judges are thrown down by the sides of the rock; and they shall hear my words, that they are sweet.
As when one cleaveth and breaketh up the earth, our bones are scattered at the grave's mouth.
For mine eyes are unto Thee, O GOD the L-rd; in Thee have I taken refuge, O pour not out my soul.
Keep me from the snare which they have laid for me, and from the gins of the workers of iniquity.
Let the wicked fall into their own nets, whilst I withal escape.

For the Leader. A Psalm of David.
Deliver me, O HaShem, from the evil man; preserve me from the violent man;
Who devise evil things in their heart; every day do they stir up wars.
They have sharpened their tongue like a serpent; vipers' venom is under their lips. Selah
Keep me, O HaShem, from the hands of the wicked; preserve me from the violent man; who have purposed to make my steps slip.
The proud have hid a snare for me, and cords; they have spread a net by the wayside; they have set gins for me. Selah
I have said unto HaShem: 'Thou art my G-d'; give ear, O HaShem, unto the voice of my supplications.
O GOD the L-rd, the strength of my salvation, who hast screened my head in the day of battle,
Grant not, O HaShem, the desires of the wicked; further not his evil device, so that they exalt themselves. Selah
As for the head of those that compass me about, let the mischief of their own lips cover them.
Let burning coals fall upon them; let them be cast into the fire, into deep pits, that they rise not up again.
A slanderer shall not be established in the earth; the violent and evil man shall be hunted with thrust upon thrust.
I know that HaShem will maintain the cause of the poor, and the right of the needy.
Surely the righteous shall give thanks unto Thy name; the upright shall dwell in Thy presence.

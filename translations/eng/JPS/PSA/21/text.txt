For the Leader. A Psalm of David.
O HaShem, in Thy strength the king rejoiceth; and in Thy salvation how greatly doth he exult!
Thou hast given him his heart's desire, and the request of his lips Thou hast not withholden. Selah
For Thou meetest him with choicest blessings; Thou settest a crown of fine gold on his head.
He asked life of Thee, Thou gavest it him; even length of days for ever and ever.
His glory is great through Thy salvation; honour and majesty dost Thou lay upon him.
For Thou makest him most blessed for ever; Thou makest him glad with joy in Thy presence.
For the king trusteth in HaShem, yea, in the mercy of the Most High; he shall not be moved.
Thy hand shall be equal to all thine enemies; thy right hand shall overtake those that hate thee.
Thou shalt make them as a fiery furnace in the time of thine anger; HaShem shall swallow them up in His wrath, and the fire shall devour them.
Their fruit shalt thou destroy from the earth, and their seed from among the children of men.
For they intended evil against thee, they imagined a device, wherewith they shall not prevail.
For thou shalt make them turn their back, thou shalt make ready with thy bowstrings against the face of them.
Be Thou exalted, O HaShem, in Thy strength; so will we sing and praise Thy power.

O come, let us sing unto HaShem; let us shout for joy to the Rock of our salvation.
Let us come before His presence with thanksgiving, let us shout for joy unto Him with psalms.
For HaShem is a great G-d, and a great King above all gods;
In whose hand are the depths of the earth; the heights of the mountains are His also.
The sea is His, and He made it; and His hands formed the dry land.
O come, let us bow down and bend the knee; let us kneel before HaShem our Maker;
For He is our G-d, and we are the people of His pasture, and the flock of His hand. To-day, if ye would but hearken to His voice!
'Harden not your heart, as at Meribah, as in the day of Massah in the wilderness;
When your fathers tried Me, proved Me, even though they saw My work.
For forty years was I wearied with that generation, and said: It is a people that do err in their heart, and they have not known My ways;
Wherefore I swore in My wrath, that they should not enter into My rest.'

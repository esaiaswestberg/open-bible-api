Hallelujah. Praise ye the name of HaShem; give praise, O ye servants of HaShem,
Ye that stand in the house of HaShem, in the courts of the house of our G-d.
Praise ye HaShem, for HaShem is good; sing praises unto His name, for it is pleasant.
For HaShem hath chosen Jacob unto Himself, and Israel for His own treasure.
For I know that HaShem is great, and that our L-rd is above all gods.
Whatsoever HaShem pleased, that hath He done, in heaven and in earth, in the seas and in all deeps;
Who causeth the vapours to ascend from the ends of the earth; He maketh lightnings for the rain; He bringeth forth the wind out of His treasuries.
Who smote the first-born of Egypt, both of man and beast.
He sent signs and wonders into the midst of thee, O Egypt, upon Pharaoh, and upon all his servants.
Who smote many nations, and slew mighty kings:
Sihon king of the Amorites, and Og king of Bashan, and all the kingdoms of Canaan;
And gave their land for a heritage, a heritage unto Israel His people.
O HaShem, Thy name endureth for ever; thy memorial, O HaShem, throughout all generations.
For HaShem will judge His people, and repent Himself for His servants.
The idols of the nations are silver and gold, the work of men's hands.
They have mouths, but they speak not; eyes have they, but they see not;
They have ears, but they hear not; neither is there any breath in their mouths.
They that make them shall be like unto them; yea, every one that trusteth in them.
O house of Israel, bless ye HaShem; O house of Aaron, bless ye HaShem;
O house of Levi, bless ye HaShem; ye that fear HaShem, bless ye HaShem.
Blessed be HaShem out of Zion, who dwelleth at Jerusalem. Hallelujah.

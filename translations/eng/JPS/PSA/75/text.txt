For the Leader; Al-tashheth. A Psalm of Asaph, a Song.
We give thanks unto Thee, O G-d, we give thanks, and Thy name is near; men tell of Thy wondrous works.
'When I take the appointed time, I Myself will judge with equity.
When the earth and all the inhabitants thereof are dissolved, I Myself establish the pillars of it.' Selah
I say unto the arrogant: 'Deal not arrogantly'; and to the wicked: 'Lift not up the horn.'
Lift not up your horn on high; speak not insolence with a haughty neck.
For neither from the east, nor from the west, nor yet from the wilderness, cometh lifting up.
For G-d is judge; He putteth down one, and lifteth up another.
For in the hand of HaShem there is a cup, with foaming wine, full of mixture, and He poureth out of the same; surely the dregs thereof, all the wicked of the earth shall drain them, and drink them.
But as for me, I will declare for ever, I will sing praises to the G-d of Jacob.
All the horns of the wicked also will I cut off; but the horns of the righteous shall be lifted up.

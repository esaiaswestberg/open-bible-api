And yet for all this we make a sure covenant, and subscribe it; and our princes, our Levites, and our priests, set their seal unto it.

And the rest of the people, the priests, the Levites, the porters, the singers, the Nethinim, and all they that had separated themselves from the peoples of the lands unto the law of G-d, their wives, their sons, and their daughters, every one that had knowledge and understanding;
they cleaved to their brethren, their nobles, and entered into a curse, and into an oath, to walk in G-d's law, which was given by Moses the servant of G-d, and to observe and do all the commandments of HaShem our L-rd, and His ordinances and His statutes;
and that we would not give our daughters unto the peoples of the land, nor take their daughters for our sons;
and if the peoples of the land bring ware or any victuals on the sabbath day to sell, that we would not buy of them on the sabbath, or on a holy day; and that we would forego the seventh year, and the exaction of every debt.
Also we made ordinances for us, to charge ourselves yearly with the third part of a shekel for the service of the house of our G-d;
for the showbread, and for the continual meal-offering, and for the continual burnt-offering, of the sabbaths, of the new moons, for the appointed seasons, and for the holy things, and for the sin-offerings to make atonement for Israel, and for all the work of the house of our G-d.
And we cast lots, the priests, the Levites, and the people, for the wood-offering, to bring it into the house of our G-d, according to our fathers' houses, at times appointed, year by year, to burn upon the altar of HaShem our G-d, as it is written in the Law;
and to bring the first-fruits of our land, and the first-fruits of all fruit of all manner of trees, year by year, unto the house of HaShem;
also the first-born of our sons, and of our cattle, as it is written in the Law, and the firstlings of our herds and of our flocks, to bring to the house of our G-d, unto the priests that minister in the house of our G-d;
and that we should bring the first of our dough, and our heave-offerings, and the fruit of all manner of trees, the wine and the oil, unto the priests, to the chambers of the house of our G-d; and the tithes of our land unto the Levites; for they, the Levites, take the tithes in all the cities of our tillage.
And the priest the son of Aaron shall be with the Levites, when the Levites take tithes; and the Levites shall bring up the tithe of the tithes unto the house of our G-d, to the chambers, into the treasure-house.
For the children of Israel and the children of Levi shall bring the heave-offering of the corn, of the wine, and of the oil, unto the chambers, where are the vessels of the sanctuary, and the priests that minister, and the porters, and the singers; and we will not forsake the house of our G-d.

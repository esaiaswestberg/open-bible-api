Paul, and Silvanus, and Timotheus, unto the assembly of the Thessalonians in יהוה our Father and the Master Yahushua the Messiah:
Favour unto you, and peace, from יהוה our Father and the Master Yahushua the Messiah.
We are bound to thank יהוה always for you, brethren, as it is meet, because that your faith groweth exceedingly, and the charity of every one of you all toward each other aboundeth;
So that we ourselves glory in you in the assemblies of יהוה for your patience and faith in all your persecutions and tribulations that ye endure:
Which is a manifest token of the righteous judgment of יהוה, that ye may be counted worthy of the kingdom of יהוה, for which ye also suffer:
Seeing it is a righteous thing with יהוה to recompense tribulation to them that trouble you;
And to you who are troubled rest with us, when the Master Yahushua shall be revealed from heaven with his mighty angels,
In flaming fire taking vengeance on them that know not יהוה, and that obey not the gospel of our Master Yahushua the Messiah:
Who shall be punished with everlasting destruction from the presence of יהוה, and from the glory of his power;
When he shall come to be glorified in his saints, and to be admired in all them that believe (because our testimony among you was believed) in that day.
Wherefore also we pray always for you, that our Elohim would count you worthy of this calling, and fulfil all the good pleasure of his goodness, and the work of faith with power:
That the name of our Master Yahushua the Messiah may be glorified in you, and ye in him, according to the favour of our Elohim and the Master Yahushua the Messiah.

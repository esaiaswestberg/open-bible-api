And it came to pass in the fourth year of king Darius, that the word of יהוה came unto Zechariah in the fourth day of the ninth month, even in Chisleu;
When they had sent unto the house of El Sherezer and Regem-melech, and their men, to pray before יהוה,
And to speak unto the priests which were in the house of יהוה of hosts, and to the prophets, saying, Should I weep in the fifth month, separating myself, as I have done these so many years?
Then came the word of יהוה of hosts unto me, saying,
Speak unto all the people of the land, and to the priests, saying, When ye fasted and mourned in the fifth and seventh month, even those seventy years, did ye at all fast unto me, even to me?
And when ye did eat, and when ye did drink, did not ye eat for yourselves, and drink for yourselves?
Should ye not hear the words which יהוה hath cried by the former prophets, when Jerusalem was inhabited and in prosperity, and the cities thereof round about her, when men inhabited the south and the plain?
And the word of יהוה came unto Zechariah, saying,
Thus speaketh יהוה of hosts, saying, Execute true judgment, and shew mercy and compassions every man to his brother:
And oppress not the widow, nor the fatherless, the stranger, nor the poor; and let none of you imagine evil against his brother in your heart.
But they refused to hearken, and pulled away the shoulder, and stopped their ears, that they should not hear.
Yea, they made their hearts as an adamant stone, lest they should hear the law, and the words which יהוה of hosts hath sent in his spirit by the former prophets: therefore came a great wrath from יהוה of hosts.
Therefore it is come to pass, that as he cried, and they would not hear; so they cried, and I would not hear, saith יהוה of hosts:
But I scattered them with a whirlwind among all the nations whom they knew not. Thus the land was desolate after them, that no man passed through nor returned: for they laid the pleasant land desolate.

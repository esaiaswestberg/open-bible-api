Paul, and Silvanus, and Timotheus, unto the assembly of the Thessalonians which is in יהוה the Father and in the Master Yahushua the Messiah: favour be unto you, and peace, from יהוה our Father, and the Master Yahushua the Messiah.
We give thanks to יהוה always for you all, making mention of you in our prayers;
Remembering without ceasing your work of faith, and labour of love, and patience of hope in our Master Yahushua the Messiah, in the sight of יהוה and our Father;
Knowing, brethren beloved, your election of Elohim.
For our gospel came not unto you in word only, but also in power, and in the Holy Spirit, and in much assurance; as ye know what manner of men we were among you for your sake.
And ye became followers of us, and of the Master, having received the word in much affliction, with joy of the Holy Spirit:
So that ye were ensamples to all that believe in Macedonia and Achaia.
For from you sounded out the word of the Master not only in Macedonia and Achaia, but also in every place your faith toward יהוה is spread abroad; so that we need not to speak any thing.
For they themselves shew of us what manner of entering in we had unto you, and how ye turned to יהוה from idols to serve the living and true Elohim;
And to wait for his Son from heaven, whom he raised from the dead, even Yahushua, which delivered us from the wrath to come.

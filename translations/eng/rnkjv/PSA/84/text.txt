How amiable are thy tabernacles, O יהוה of hosts!
My soul longeth, yea, even fainteth for the courts of יהוה: my heart and my flesh crieth out for the living El.
Yea, the sparrow hath found an house, and the swallow a nest for herself, where she may lay her young, even thine altars, O יהוה of hosts, my King, and my Elohim.
Blessed are they that dwell in thy house: they will be still praising thee. Selah.
Blessed is the man whose strength is in thee; in whose heart are the ways of them.
Who passing through the valley of Baca make it a well; the rain also filleth the pools.
They go from strength to strength, every one of them in Zion appeareth before Elohim.
O יהוה Elohim of hosts, hear my prayer: give ear, O Elohim of Jacob. Selah.
Behold, O Elohim our shield, and look upon the face of thine anointed.
For a day in thy courts is better than a thousand. I had rather be a doorkeeper in the house of my Elohim, than to dwell in the tents of wickedness.
For יהוה Elohim is a sun and shield: יהוה will give favour and glory: no good thing will he withhold from them that walk uprightly.
O יהוה of hosts, blessed is the man that trusteth in thee.

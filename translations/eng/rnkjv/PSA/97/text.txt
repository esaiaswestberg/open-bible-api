יהוה reigneth; let the earth rejoice; let the multitude of isles be glad thereof.
Clouds and darkness are round about him: righteousness and judgment are the habitation of his throne.
A fire goeth before him, and burneth up his enemies round about.
His lightnings enlightened the world: the earth saw, and trembled.
The hills melted like wax at the presence of יהוה, at the presence of the Master of the whole earth.
The heavens declare his righteousness, and all the people see his glory.
Confounded be all they that serve graven images, that boast themselves of idols: worship him, all ye elohim.
Zion heard, and was glad; and the daughters of Judah rejoiced because of thy judgments, O יהוה.
For thou, יהוה, art high above all the earth: thou art exalted far above all elohim.
Ye that love יהוה, hate evil: he preserveth the souls of his saints; he delivereth them out of the hand of the wicked.
Light is sown for the righteous, and gladness for the upright in heart.
Rejoice in יהוה, ye righteous; and give thanks at the remembrance of his holiness.

I will praise thee with my whole heart: before the mighty will I sing praise unto thee.
I will worship toward thy holy temple, and praise thy name for thy lovingkindness and for thy truth: for thou hast magnified above all, thy name, thy word.
In the day when I cried thou answeredst me, and strengthenedst me with strength in my soul.
All the kings of the earth shall praise thee, O יהוה, when they hear the words of thy mouth.
Yea, they shall sing in the ways of יהוה: for great is the glory of יהוה.
Though יהוה be high, yet hath he respect unto the lowly: but the proud he knoweth afar off.
Though I walk in the midst of trouble, thou wilt revive me: thou shalt stretch forth thine hand against the wrath of mine enemies, and thy right hand shall save me.
יהוה will perfect that which concerneth me: thy mercy, O יהוה, endureth for ever: forsake not the works of thine own hands.

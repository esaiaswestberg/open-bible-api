יהוה, how are they increased that trouble me! many are they that rise up against me.
Many there be which say of my soul, There is no help for him in Elohim. Selah.
But thou, O יהוה, art a shield for me; my glory, and the lifter up of mine head.
I cried unto יהוה with my voice, and he heard me out of his holy hill. Selah.
I laid me down and slept; I awaked; for יהוה sustained me.
I will not be afraid of ten thousands of people, that have set themselves against me round about.
Arise, O יהוה; save me, O my Elohim: for thou hast smitten all mine enemies upon the cheek bone; thou hast broken the teeth of the wicked.
Salvation belongeth unto יהוה: thy blessing is upon thy people. Selah.

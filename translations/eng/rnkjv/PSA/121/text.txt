I will lift up mine eyes unto the hills, from whence cometh my help.
My help cometh from יהוה, which made heaven and earth.
He will not suffer thy foot to be moved: he that keepeth thee will not slumber.
Behold, he that keepeth Israel shall neither slumber nor sleep.
יהוה is thy keeper: יהוה is thy shade upon thy right hand.
The sun shall not smite thee by day, nor the moon by night.
יהוה shall preserve thee from all evil: he shall preserve thy soul.
יהוה shall preserve thy going out and thy coming in from this time forth, and even for evermore.

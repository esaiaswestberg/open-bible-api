Judge me, O Elohim, and plead my cause against an wicked nation: O deliver me from the deceitful and unjust man.
For thou art the Elohim of my strength: why dost thou cast me off? why go I mourning because of the oppression of the enemy?
O send out thy light and thy truth: let them lead me; let them bring me unto thy holy hill, and to thy tabernacles.
Then will I go unto the altar of Elohim, unto El my exceeding joy: yea, upon the harp will I praise thee, O Elohim my Elohim.
Why art thou cast down, O my soul? and why art thou disquieted within me? hope in Elohim: for I shall yet praise him, who is the health of my countenance, and my Elohim.

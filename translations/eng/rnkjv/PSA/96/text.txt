O sing unto יהוה a new song: sing unto יהוה, all the earth.
Sing unto יהוה, bless his name; shew forth his salvation from day to day.
Declare his glory among the heathen, his wonders among all people.
For יהוה is great, and greatly to be praised: he is to be feared above all elohim.
For all the elohim of the nations are idols: but יהוה made the heavens.
Honour and majesty are before him: strength and beauty are in his sanctuary.
Give unto יהוה, O ye kindreds of the people, give unto יהוה glory and strength.
Give unto יהוה the glory due unto his name: bring an offering, and come into his courts.
O worship יהוה in the beauty of holiness: fear before him, all the earth.
Say among the heathen that יהוה reigneth: the world also shall be established that it shall not be moved: he shall judge the people righteously.
Let the heavens rejoice, and let the earth be glad; let the sea roar, and the fulness thereof.
Let the field be joyful, and all that is therein: then shall all the trees of the wood rejoice
Before יהוה: for he cometh, for he cometh to judge the earth: he shall judge the world with righteousness, and the people with his truth.

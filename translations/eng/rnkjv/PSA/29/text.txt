Give unto יהוה, O ye mighty, give unto יהוה glory and strength.
Give unto יהוה the glory due unto his name; worship יהוה in the beauty of holiness.
The voice of יהוה is upon the waters: the El of glory thundereth: יהוה is upon many waters.
The voice of יהוה is powerful; the voice of יהוה is full of majesty.
The voice of יהוה breaketh the cedars; yea, יהוה breaketh the cedars of Lebanon.
He maketh them also to skip like a calf; Lebanon and Sirion like a young unicorn.
The voice of יהוה divideth the flames of fire.
The voice of יהוה shaketh the wilderness; יהוה shaketh the wilderness of Kadesh.
The voice of יהוה maketh the hinds to calve, and discovereth the forests: and in his temple doth every one speak of his glory.
יהוה sitteth upon the flood; yea, יהוה sitteth King for ever.
יהוה will give strength unto his people; יהוה will bless his people with peace.

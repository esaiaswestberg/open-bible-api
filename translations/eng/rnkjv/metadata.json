  "description": "The Restored Name King James Version is an English Bible translation that modifies the traditional King James Version by replacing the title \"Lord\" or \"God\" with the original Hebrew names, such as \"Yahweh\", and \"Jesus\" with Yahushua. It aims to align the KJV text more closely with its Hebraic roots."

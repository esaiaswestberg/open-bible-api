And he overlaid it with pure gold within and without, and made a crown of gold for it all around.
And he cast for it four rings of gold, to be set by its four corners; even two rings upon its one side, and two rings upon its other side

And he made the mercy seat of pure gold: two cubits and a half was the length of it, and one cubit and a half the breadth of it.
And he made two cherubim of gold, beaten out of one piece he made them, on the two ends of the mercy seat;
One cherub on the end on this side, and another cherub on the other end on that side: out of the mercy seat made he the cherubim on its two ends.
And the cherubim spread out their wings on high, and covered with their wings over the mercy seat, with their faces one to another; even toward the mercy seat were the faces of the cherubim.

Also he made for it a border of an handbreadth all around; and made a crown of gold for its border all around.

Three bowls made after the fashion of almonds in one branch, a knob and a flower; and three bowls made like almonds in another branch, a knob and a flower: so throughout the six branches going out of the lampstand.
And in the lampstand were four bowls made like almonds, its knobs, and its flowers:
And a knob under two branches of the same, and a knob under two branches of the same, and a knob under two branches of the same, according to the six branches going out of it.
Their knobs and their branches were of the same: all of it was one beaten work of pure gold.

I will sing of mercy and judgment: to thee, O LORD, will I sing.
I will behave myself wisely in a perfect way. O when wilt thou come to me? I will walk within my house with a perfect heart.
I will set no wicked thing before my eyes: I hate the work of them that turn aside; it shall not cleave to me.
A perverse heart shall depart from me: I will not know a wicked person .
Whoever secretly slandereth his neighbour, him will I cut off: him that hath an high look and a proud heart I will not endure.
My eyes shall be upon the faithful of the land, that they may dwell with me: he that walketh in a perfect way, he shall serve me.
He that worketh deceit shall not dwell within my house: he that telleth lies shall not tarry in my sight.
I will early destroy all the wicked of the land; that I may cut off all who practise wickedness from the city of the LORD.

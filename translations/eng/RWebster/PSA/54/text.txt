Save me, O God, by thy name, and judge me by thy strength.
Hear my prayer, O God; give ear to the words of my mouth.
For strangers have risen up against me, and oppressors seek after my soul: they have not set God before them. Selah.
Behold, Godis my helper: the Lord is with them that uphold my soul.
He shall reward evil to my enemies: cut them off in thy truth.
I will freely sacrifice to thee: I will praise thy name, O LORD; for it is good.
For he hath delivered me out of all trouble: and my eye hath seen its desire upon my enemies.

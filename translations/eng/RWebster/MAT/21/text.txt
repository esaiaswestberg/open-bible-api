Saying to them, Go into the village opposite you, and immediately ye shall find a donkey tied, and a colt with her: loose them, and bring them to me.
And if any man shall say any thing to you, ye shall say,  The Lord hath need of them; and immediately he will send them.
All this was done, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, saying,
Tell ye the daughter of Zion, Behold, thy King cometh to thee, meek, and sitting upon a donkey, and a colt the foal of a donkey.
And the disciples went, and did as Jesus commanded them,
And brought the donkey, and the colt, and put on them their clothes, and they set him on it.

And when he saw a fig tree in the way, he came to it, and found nothing on it, but leaves only, and said to it, Let no fruit grow on thee henceforth for ever. And immediately the fig tree withered away.
And when the disciples saw it, they marvelled, saying, How soon is the fig tree withered away!
Jesus answered and said to them, Verily I say to you, If ye have faith, and doubt not, ye shall not only do this which is done to the fig tree, but also if ye shall say to this mountain, Be thou removed, and be thou cast into the sea; it shall be done.
And all things, whatever ye shall ask in prayer, believing, ye shall receive.

The baptism of John, where was it from? from heaven, or from men? And they reasoned with themselves, saying, If we shall say, From heaven; he will say to us, Why then did ye not believe him?

But what think ye? A certainman had two sons; and he came to the first, and said, Son, go work to day in my vineyard.

Which of the two did the will of his father? They say to him, The first. Jesus saith to them, Verily I say to you, That the tax collectors and the harlots go into the kingdom of God before you.
For John came to you in the way of righteousness, and ye believed him not: but the tax collectors and the harlots believed him: and ye, when ye had seen it, repented not afterward, that ye might believe him.
Hear another parable: There was a certain householder, who planted a vineyard, and hedged around it, and dug a winepress in it, and built a tower, and let it out to vinedressers, and went into a far country:
And when the time of the fruit drew near, he sent his servants to the vinedressers, that they might receive its fruits.
And the vinedressers took his servants, and beat one,  and killed another, and stoned another.
Again, he sent other servants more than the first: and they did to them in like manner.
But last of all he sent to them his son, saying, They will reverence my son.
But when the vinedressers saw the son, they said among themselves, This is the heir; come, let us kill him, and let us seize on his inheritance.
And they caught him, and cast him out of the vineyard, and slew him .

Jesus saith to them, Did ye never read in the scriptures, The stone which the builders rejected, the same is become the head of the corner: this is the Lord’s doing, and it is marvellous in our eyes?

And whoever shall fall on this stone shall be broken: but on whomever it shall fall, it will grind him to powder.
And when the chief priests and Pharisees had heard his parables, they perceived that he spoke of them.

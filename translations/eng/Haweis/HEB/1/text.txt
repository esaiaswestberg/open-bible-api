GOD, who spake to the fathers of old at various times, and in different manners by the prophets,
in these last days hath spoken to us by a Son, whom he hath appointed heir of all things, by whom also he made the worlds;
who being the splendour of his glory, and the very impress of his substance, and upholding all things with his powerful word, by himself having effected the cleansing of our sins, he sat down at the right hand of Majesty on high;
made as much superior to the angels, as he hath inherited a more distinguished name than they.
For to which of the angels ever said he, “My Son art thou, I have to-day begotten thee?” And again, “I will be to him a Father, and he shall be to me a Son?”
And again, when he introduces the first-begotten into the world, he saith, “Let all the angels of God also worship him.”
And concerning the angels indeed he thus speaks: “Who maketh his angels spirits, and his ministering servants a flame of fire.”
But to the Son, “Thy throne, O God, is unto eternity; a sceptre of rectitude is the sceptre of thy kingdom.
Thou hast loved righteousness, and hated iniquity; therefore God, thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of exultation above those who partake with thee.”
“And thou from the beginning, O Lord, hast founded the earth, and the heavens are the works of thine hands.
They will be destroyed, but thou remainest; and they all will grow old as a garment,
and as a cloak thou wilt wrap them up, and they will undergo a change: but thou art the same, and thy years will never end.”
Unto which indeed of the angels said he ever, “Sit at my right hand until I put thine enemies for a footstool of thy feet?”
Are they not all ministerial spirits, sent to perform service on account of those who are about to inherit salvation?

NOW the Spirit speaketh expresly, that in the latter days some will apostatise from the faith, giving heed to spirits of delusion, and doctrines of devils;
men who teach lies with hypocrisy; and have their own consciences cauterised;
prohibiting marriage, and enjoining abstinence from particular meats, which God created to be received with thanksgiving by the faithful, and those who acknowledge the truth.
For every creature of God is good, and none to be rejected, if used with thanksgiving:
for it is sanctified by the word of God and prayer.
If thou suggest these truths to the brethren, thou shalt be a good minister of Jesus Christ, nourished up in the words of faith and sound doctrine, whereunto thou hast attained.
But profane and antiquated fables reject, but exercise thyself unto godliness.
For bodily exercise is of little advantage, but godliness is profitable for all things, having the promise of the life which now is, and of that which is to come.
This is a faithful saying, and deserving all acceptance.
For therefore do we labour and are exposed to abuse, because we have hoped in the living God, who is the Saviour of all men, especially of the faithful.
Announce and teach these things.
Let no man despise thy youth; but be a pattern of the faithful, in discourse; in conduct, in love, in spirit, in faith, in purity.
Till I come, apply to reading, to exhortation, to teaching.
Neglect not the gift which is in thee, which was given thee by prophecy, with imposition of the hands of the presbytery.
Let these things be thy care; be wholly devoted to them; that thy progress may be evident to all men.
Take heed unto thyself, and to thy doctrine; abide in them: for so doing thou shalt both save thyself, and those who hear thee.

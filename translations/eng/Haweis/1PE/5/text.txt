THE presbyters among you I exhort, who am a co-presbyter and a witness of the sufferings of Christ, and a partaker of the glory which shall be revealed:
feed the flock of God which is among you, exercising your pastoral office not of necessity, but of choice, not for base gain, but with alacrity of mind;
not as domineering over your allotted congregations, but as being examples of the flock.
And when the arch Shepherd shall appear, ye shall receive a crown of glory that will never fade away.
In like manner, ye who are younger persons, be in subjection to your elders: but all of you be subject one to another, and be clothed from head to foot with humility: for God sets himself in opposition to the proud, but he giveth grace to the lowly.
Humble yourselves therefore beneath the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt you in due season:
casting all your anxiety upon him; for he careth for you.
Be sober, be vigilant; for your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, prowleth around, seeking whom he may devour:
against whom stand fast, firm in the faith, knowing that the very same sufferings are fully endured by the brotherhood which is in the world.
But the God of all grace, who hath called us to his eternal glory by Christ Jesus, when ye have suffered a little while, himself perfect, stablish, strengthen, settle you.
To him be glory and might for ever and ever. Amen.
By Silvanus, a faithful brother as I think, I have written to you a few words, exhorting, and testifying that this is the true grace of God wherein ye are standing fast.
She who is co-elect at Babylon, saluteth you, and my son Mark.
Salute one another with a kiss of love. Peace be with you all that are in Christ Jesus. Amen. \p

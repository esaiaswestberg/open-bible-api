THIS third time I am coming to you: by the mouth of two or three witnesses shall every charge be established.
I have told you before, and I repeat it, as when I was present the second time, and now absent, I write to those who have sinned already, and to all the rest, that if I come again, I will not spare you:
since ye demand a proof that Christ speaketh in me, who to you-ward is not weak, but is mighty in you.
For though he was crucified in weakness, yet he liveth by the power of God: for we also are weak in him, but we shall live with him by the power of God displayed towards you.
Examine yourselves, whether ye are in the faith; prove your ownselves: know ye not your ownselves, that Jesus Christ is in you, except ye be reprobate?
But I hope that ye shall know that we are not reprobate.
Now I pray unto God that ye do no evil, not that we should appear approved, but that you may do that which is laudable, though we should be as reprobates.
For we can do nothing against the truth, but for the truth.
For we rejoice when we are weak, but ye are strong: and this also we pray for, even your perfect establishment.
For this cause, though absent, I have written these things, that when I am present I may not use severity, according to the power which the Lord hath given me for edification, and not for destruction.
Finally, brethren, rejoice: be perfectly united together, be comforted, be of one mind, live in peace; and the God of love and peace shall be with you.
Salute one another with a holy kiss.
All the saints salute you.
The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the communion of the Holy Ghost be with you all. Amen.   The second epistle to the Corinthians was written from Philippi, a city of Macedonia, by Titus and Luke. \p

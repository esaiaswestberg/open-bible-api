IT is generally reported that there is whoredom among you, and such whoredom as is not even named among the Gentiles, that one should have his father’s wife.
And ye are puffed up, though ought ye not rather to be grieved? that he who hath done this deed might be plucked from the midst of you.
For I indeed, as absent in body, but present in spirit, have already, as present, passed judgment on him who hath so done this thing;
in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, ye being assembled together and my spirit with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ,
to deliver such a one over to Satan for the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus.
Your glorying is not good: know ye not that a little leaven leaveneth the whole mass?
Purge out therefore the old leaven, that ye may be a new mass, as ye are unleavened.   For our passover hath been sacrificed for us, even Christ.
Therefore let us keep the feast, not with old leaven, nor with the leaven of malice and wickedness, but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.
I have written unto you in an epistle that you should not associate with fornicators.
Yet not altogether with the fornicators of this world, or the covetous, or extortioners, or idolaters: for then must ye indeed go out of the world.
But now I have written unto you not to associate with him, if any man, professing to be a brother, be a fornicator, or covetous, or an idolater, or a railer, or a drunkard, or an extortioner, with such a one not even to eat.
For what call have I to judge those who are without? Do not ye judge those who are within the church?
But those who are without God judgeth. Put then away that wicked man from among yourselves.

PAUL, and Silvanus, and Timothy, to the church of the Thessalonians in God the Father, and in the Lord Jesus Christ: grace unto you, and peace from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ.
We give thanks to God always for you all, making mention of you in our prayers;
without ceasing calling to mind your work of faith, and labour of love, and patience of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ, before our God and Father;
knowing, brethren, beloved of God, your election.
For our gospel came not unto you in word only, but in power, and in the Holy Ghost, and in great fulness of assurance; as ye know what manner of men we have been among you for your sakes.
And ye became imitators of us, and of the Lord, receiving the word in much affliction, with joy of the Holy Ghost;
so that ye became models for all that believe in Macedonia and Achaia.
For from you sounded forth the word of the Lord, not only into Macedonia and Achaia, but into every region also your fidelity towards God is gone out, so that we have no need to say any thing.
For they publish concerning you what manner of entrance we had unto you, and how ye turned unto God from idols, to serve the living and true God,
and to wait for his Son from the heavens, whom he raised from the dead, even Jesus, who delivereth us from the wrath to come.

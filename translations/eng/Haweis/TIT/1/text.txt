PAUL, a servant of God, and an apostle of Jesus Christ, according to the faith of the elect of God, and the knowledge of truth which leads to godliness;
in hope of life eternal, which God, who cannot lie, hath promised before time had a being;
but hath manifested in his own appointed season his word by the preaching, with which I have been entrusted, according to the command of our Saviour God;
to Titus, my genuine son after the common faith, be grace, mercy, peace, from God the Father and our Lord Jesus Christ our Saviour.
For this purpose I left thee behind me at Crete, that thou mightest direct the regulations which remained to be executed, and that thou shouldest appoint presbyters in every city, as I charged thee to do:

For a bishop ought to be irreproachable, as the steward of God; not self-willed, not irritable, not addicted to wine, not quarrelsome, not greedy of filthy lucre;
but the stranger’s host, the good man’s friend, grave, just, holy, temperate;
firmly attached to the faithful word, according to the doctrine delivered, that he may be able to exhort with sound instruction and to confute the opposers.
For there are many disorderly persons vainly talkative, and under a spirit of delusion, especially some of the circumcised;

This testimony is true. For which cause rebuke them with severity, that they may be sound in the faith;
not attending to Jewish fables, and injunctions of men, who have turned away from the truth.
All things indeed are clean to the clean: but to the defiled and to the unbelievers there is nothing clean; but their very mind and conscience are defiled.
They profess to know God; but in works deny him, being abominable and disobedient, and unto every good work reprobate.

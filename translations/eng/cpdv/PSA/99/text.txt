A Psalm of Confession.
Shout joyfully to God, all the earth. Serve the Lord with rejoicing. Enter into his sight in exultation.
Know that the Lord himself is God. He made us, and we ourselves did not. We are his people and the sheep of his pasture.
Enter his gates with confession, his courts with hymns, and acknowledge him. Praise his name.
For the Lord is sweet, his mercy is in eternity, and his truth is from generation to generation.

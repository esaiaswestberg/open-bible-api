Alleluia. Of Haggai and Zachariah.
Praise the Lord, O my soul. I will praise the Lord with my life. I will sing psalms to my God as long as I shall be. Do not trust in the leaders,
in the sons of men, in whom there is no salvation.
His spirit will depart, and he will return to his earth. In that day, all their thoughts will perish.
Blessed is he whose help is the God of Jacob: his hope is in the Lord God himself,
who made heaven and earth, the sea, and all the things that are in them.
He preserves the truth forever. He executes judgment for those who suffer injury. He provides food for the hungry. The Lord releases those who are bound.
The Lord enlightens the blind. The Lord sets upright those who have been thrown down. The Lord loves the just.
The Lord watches over new arrivals. He will support the orphan and the widow. And he will destroy the ways of sinners.
The Lord shall reign forever: your God, O Zion, from generation to generation.

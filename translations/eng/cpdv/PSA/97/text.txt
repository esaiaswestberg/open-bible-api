A Psalm of David himself.  Sing to the Lord a new song, for he has performed wonders. His right hand has accomplished salvation for him, with his holy arm.
The Lord has made known his salvation. He has revealed his justice in the sight of the nations.
He has remembered his mercy and his truth toward the house of Israel. All the ends of the earth have seen the salvation of our God.
Sing joyfully to God, all the earth. Sing and exult, and sing psalms.
Sing psalms to the Lord with stringed instruments, with strings and the voice of a psalmist,
with subtle wind instruments and the voice of woodwinds. Make a joyful noise before the Lord our king.
Let the sea be moved and all its fullness, the whole world and all who dwell in it.
The rivers will clap their hands, the mountains will exult together,
before the presence of the Lord. For he comes to judge the earth. He will judge the whole world with justice, and the peoples with fairness.

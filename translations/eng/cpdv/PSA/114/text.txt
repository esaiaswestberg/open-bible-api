Alleluia.  I have loved: therefore, the Lord will heed the voice of my prayer.
For he has inclined his ear to me. And in my days, I will call upon him.
The sorrows of death have surrounded me, and the perils of Hell have found me. I have found tribulation and sorrow.
And so, I called upon the name of the Lord. O Lord, free my soul.
Merciful is the Lord, and just. And our God is compassionate.
The Lord is the keeper of little ones. I was humbled, and he freed me.
Turn again, my soul, to your rest. For the Lord has done good to you.
For he has rescued my soul from death, my eyes from tears, my feet from slipping.
I will please the Lord in the land of the living.

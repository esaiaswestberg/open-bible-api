For although I may be unskilled in speech, yet I am not so in knowledge. But, in all things, we have been made manifest to you.
Or did I commit a sin by humbling myself so that you would be exalted? For I preached the Gospel of God to you freely.
I have taken from other churches, receiving a stipend from them to the benefit of your ministry.
And when I was with you and in need, I was burdensome to no one. For the brothers who came from Macedonia supplied whatever was lacking to me. And in all things, I have kept myself, and I will keep myself, from being burdensome to you.

And no wonder, for even Satan presents himself as if he were an Angel of light.
Therefore, it is no great thing if his ministers present themselves as if they were ministers of justice, for their end shall be according to their works.
I say again. And let no one consider me to be foolish. Or, at least, accept me as if I were foolish, so that I also may glory a small amount.

Since so many glory according to the flesh, I will glory also.

They are Hebrews; so am I. They are Israelites; so am I. They are the offspring of Abraham; so am I.

Who is weak, and I am not weak? Who is scandalized, and I am not being burned?
If it is necessary to glory, I will glory of the things that concern my weaknesses.
The God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who is blessed forever, knows that I am not lying.

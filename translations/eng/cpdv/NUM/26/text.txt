After the blood of the guilty was shed, the Lord said to Moses, and to Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest:
“Number the entire sum of the sons of Israel, from twenty years and above, by their houses and kinships, all who are able to go forth to war.”
And so, Moses and Eleazar the priest, who were in the plains of Moab, above the Jordan, opposite Jericho, spoke to those who were
from twenty years and above, just as the Lord had commanded. And this is their number:
Ruben, the firstborn of Israel; his son, Hanoch, from whom is the family of the Hanochites; and Pallu, from whom is the family of the Palluites;
and Hezron, from whom is the family of the Hezronites; and Carmi, from whom is the family of the Carmites.

The son of Phallu: Eliab;

so that, when Korah perished, his sons did not perish.

And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:
“The land shall be divided to these, as their possessions, according to the number of their names.
To the greater number you shall give a greater portion, and to the lesser number, a lesser portion. To each one, just as they have now been counted, a possession shall be delivered.
Yet only in so far as the land is divided by lot to a tribe and to families.
Whatever the lot will happen to be, it shall be accepted, either by the greater, or by the lesser.

From Aaron were born Nadab and Abihu, and Eleazar and Ithamar.
Of these, Nadab and Abihu died, when they had offered strange fire before the Lord.
And these were all who were numbered: twenty-three thousand of the male gender, from one month and above. For they were not counted among the sons of Israel, neither was a possession given to them with the others.
This is the number of the sons of Israel, who were enrolled by Moses and by Eleazar the priest, in the plains of Moab, above the Jordan, opposite Jericho.
Among these, not one of them was numbered before, by Moses and Aaron in the desert of Sinai.
For the Lord had foretold that all would die in the wilderness. And not one of them remained, except Caleb the son of Jephunneh, and Joshua the son of Nun.

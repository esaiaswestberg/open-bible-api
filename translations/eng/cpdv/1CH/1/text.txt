Then Bela died, and Jobab, the son of Zerah, from Bozrah, reigned in his place.
And when Jobab also had died, Husham, from the land of the Temanites, reigned in his place.
Then Husham also passed away, and Hadad, the son of Bedad, reigned in his place. And he struck the Midianites in the land of Moab. The name of his city was Avith.
And when Hadad also had died, Samlah from Masrekah reigned in his place.
Then Samlah also died, and Shaul from Rehoboth, which is situated beside a river, reigned in his place.
Shaul also having died, Baal-hanan, the son of Achbor, reigned in his place.
Then he too died, and Hadar reigned in his place. And the name of his city was Pau. And his wife was called Mehetabel, the daughter of Matred, the daughter of Mezahab.

commander Oholibamah, commander Elah, commander Pinon,

For the kyngdome of heven ys lyke vnto an houssholder which went out erly in the morninge to hyre labourers into hys vyneyarde.
And he agreed wt the labourers for a peny a daye and sent them into his vyneyarde.
And he went out about the thyrde houre and sawe other stonding ydell in the marketplace
and sayd vnto them go ye also into my vyneyarde: and whatsoever is right I will geve you. And they went there waye.
Agayne he wet out about the sixte and nynthe houre and dyd lyke wyse.
And he went out aboute the eleventhe houre and founde other stondynge ydell and sayde vnto them: Why stonde ye here all the daye ydell?
They sayde vnto hym: because no man hath hyred vs. He sayde to them: goo ye alsoo into my vyneyarde and whatsoever is right that shall ye receave.
When even was come the lorde of the vyneyarde sayde vnto hys steward: call the labourers and geve them their hyre beginnyng at ye laste tyll thou come to ye fyrste.
And they whiche were hyred aboute the eleventhe houre came and receaved every man a peny.
Then came ye fyrst supposyng yt they shuld receave moare: and they likewyse receaved every man a peny.
And when they had receaved it they murmured agaynst the good man of the housse
saying: These laste have wrought but one houre and thou hast made them equall vnto vs which have born ye burthe and heet of the daye.
He answered to one of the sayinge: frende I do the no wronge: dyddest thou not agre wt me for a peny?
Take that which is thy duty and go thy waye. I will geve vnto this last as moche as to the.
Ys it not lawfull for me to do as me listeth with myne awne? Ys thyne eye evyll because I am good?
Soo the laste shalbe fyrste and the fyrste shalbe laste. For many are called and feawe be chosen.
And Iesus ascended to Ierusalem and toke the .xii. disciples a parte in the waye and sayde to the.

Then came to hym the mother of zebedes chyldren with her sonnes worshippynge him and desyringe a certayne thinge of him.
And he sayd vnto her: what wilt thou have? She sayde vnto him: Gravnte that these my two sonnes may sit ye one on thy right hond and the other on ye lifte hond in thy kyngdome.
Iesus answered and sayd: Ye wot not what ye axe. Are ye able to drynke of the cuppe yt I shall drynke of and to be baptised wt the baptyme that I shalbe baptised with? They answered to him that we are.

And when the ten hearde this they disdayned at ye two brethre:
But Iesus called them vnto him and sayde: Ye knowe yt the lordes of the gentyls have dominacio over them. And they that are great exercise power over the.
It shall not be so amoge you. But whosoever wyll be greate amoge you let him be youre minister:

For every hye prest that is taken from amoge men is ordeyned for men in thynges pertaynynge to god: to offer gyftes and sacryfyses for synne:
which can have compassion on the ignoraunt and on them that are out of the waye because that he him silfe also is compased with infirmitie:
For the which infirmities sake he is bounde to offer for synnes as well for hys awne parte as for the peoples.
And no man taketh honour vnto him silfe but he that is called of God as was Aaron.
Even so lykewise Christ glorified not him silfe to be made the hye prest: but he that sayde vnto him: thou arte my sonne this daye begat I the glorified him.
As he also in another place speaketh: Thou arte a prest for ever after the order of Melchisedech.
Which in the dayes of his flesshe did offer vp prayers and sup plicacions with stronge cryinge and teares vnto him that was able to save him from deeth: and was also hearde because of his godlines.
And though he were Goddes sonne yet learned he obediece by tho thynges which he suffered
and was made parfaite and the cause of eternall saluacion vnto all them that obey him:
and is called of God an hye prest after the order of Melchisedech.
Wherof we have many thynges to saye which are harde to be vttered: because ye are dull of hearinge.
For when as cocerninge ye tyme ye ought to be teachers yet have ye nede agayne that we teache you the fyrst principles of the worde of god: and are become soche as have nede of mylke and not of stronge meate:
For every man that is feed with mylke is inexperte in the worde of rightewesnes. For he is but a babe.
But stronge meate belongeth to them that are parfecte which thorow custome have their wittes exercised to iudge both good and evyll also.

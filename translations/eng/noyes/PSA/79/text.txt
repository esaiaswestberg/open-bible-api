O God! the nations have come into thine inheritance; They have polluted thy holy temple; They have made Jerusalem a heap of ruins!
They have given the dead bodies of thy servants to be food for the birds of heaven, The flesh of thy holy ones to the wild beasts of the earth!
Their blood have they shed like water around Jerusalem, And there was none to bury them!
We have become the reproach of our neighbors,—The scorn and derision of those around us.
How long, O LORD! wilt thou be angry for ever? How long shall thy jealousy burn like fire?
Pour out thy wrath on the nations which acknowledge thee not. And on the kingdoms which call not upon thy name!
For they have devoured Jacob, And laid waste his dwelling-place.
O remember not against us former iniquities; Let thy tender mercy speedily succor us,
For we are brought very low! Help us, O God of our salvation! for the honor of thy name; F or thy name’s sake save us, and forgive our iniquities!
Why should the nations say, "Where is their God?" May the revenging of the blood of thy servants, which hath been shed, Be manifested among the nations before our eyes!
Let the cry of the prisoner come before thee! According to the greatness of thy power preserve those that are appointed to die!
And return sevenfold into our neighbors’ bosoms The reproach with which they have reproached thee, O Lord!
So shall we, thy people, and the flock of thy pasture, Give thanks to thee for ever. And show forth thy praise to all generations.

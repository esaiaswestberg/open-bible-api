Be thou my judge, O LORD! for I have walked in uprightness. I have put my trust in the LORD, therefore shall I not fall.
Examine me, O LORD! and prove me; Try my reins and my heart!
For thy kindness is ever before my eyes, And I walk in thy truth.
I sit not with men of falsehood. And go not in company with dissemblers.
I hate the assembly of evil-doers, And do not sit with the wicked.
I wash my hands in innocence. And go around thine altar. O LORD!
To utter the voice of thanksgiving, And tell of all thy wondrous works.
O LORD! I love the habitation of thy house, The place where thine honor dwelleth!
Gather not my breath with sinners, Nor my life with men of blood,
In whose hands is mischief, And whose right hands are full of bribes!
But as for me, I walk in my integrity; Oh, redeem me, and be merciful to me!
My feet tread in a straight path; In the congregation will I bless the LORD.

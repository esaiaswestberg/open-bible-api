O LORD! thou hast been favorable to thy land; Thou hast brought back the captives of Jacob;
Thou didst forgive the iniquity of thy people, And cover all their sins! [Pause.]
Thou didst take away all thy displeasure, And abate the fierceness of thy wrath.
Restore us, O God of our salvation! And let thine anger towards us cease!
Wilt thou be angry with us for ever? Wilt thou continue thy wrath from generation to generation?
Wilt thou not revive us again, That thy people may rejoice in thee?
Show us thy compassion, O LORD! And grant us thy salvation!
I will hear what God the LORD will speak: Truly he will speak peace to his people, and to his servants; Only let them not turn again to folly!
Yea, his salvation is near to those who fear him, That glory may dwell in our land.
Mercy and truth shall meet together, Righteousness and peace shall kiss each other;
Truth shall spring out of the earth; Righteousness shall look down from heaven.
Yea, Jehovah will give prosperity, And our land shall yield her increase.
Righteousness shall go before him, And set us in the way of his steps.

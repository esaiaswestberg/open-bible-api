Make haste, O God! to deliver me, O LORD! come speedily to mine aid!
May they all be confounded, and covered with shame, Who seek to take my life! May they be driven back with disgrace Who desire to do me injury!
May they be turned back with shame Who cry out to me, "Aha! aha!"
But let all who seek thee be glad and rejoice in thee! Let them that love thy protection ever say, "May God be praised!"
But I am poor and needy; O God! hasten to mine aid! Thou art my help and my deliverer, O LORD! make no delay!

O God! thou hast forsaken us; thou hast broken us in pieces; Thou hast been angry! O revive us again!
Thou hast made the land tremble; thou hast rent it; O heal its breaches, for it tottereth!
Thou hast caused thy people to see hard things; Thou hast made us drink the wine of reeling.
Lift up a banner for them that fear thee, For the sake of thy faithfulness, that they may escape!
That thy beloved may be delivered, Save with thy right hand, and answer me!
God promiseth in his holiness; I will rejoice; I shall yet divide Shechem, And measure out the valley of Succoth.
Gilead shall be mine, and mine Manasseh; Ephraim shall be my helmet, And Judah my sceptre;
Moab shall be my wash-bowl; Upon Edom shall I cast my shoe; I shall triumph over Philistia!
Who will bring me to the strong city? Who will lead me into Edom?
Wilt not thou, O God! who didst forsake us, And didst not go forth with our armies?
Give us thine aid in our distress, For vain is the help of man!
Through God we shall do valiantly; For he will tread down our enemies.

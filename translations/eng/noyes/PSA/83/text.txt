O God! keep not silence! Hold not thy peace, and be not still, O God!
For, lo! thine enemies roar, And they who hate thee lift up their heads.
For they form secret plots against thy people, And consult together against thy chosen ones.
"Come," say they, "let us blot them out from the number of the nations, That the name of Israel may no more be remembered!"
With one consent they consult together, Against thee do they form a league,—
The tents of Edom and the Ishmaelites, Of Moab and the Hagarenes,
Gebal and Ammon and Amalek, The Philistines, with the inhabitants of Tyre.
The Assyrians also are joined with them; They lend their strength to the children of Lot.
Do to them as to the Midianites, As to Sisera, as to Jabin at the brook Kison,
Who perished at Endor, And were trampled like dung to the earth.
Make their chiefs like Oreb and Zeeb; Yea, all their princes as Zeba and Zalmunna!
Who say, "Let us seize on God’s habitations!"
Make them, O my God! like whirling chaff; Like stubble before the wind!
As fire consumeth the forest, And as flame setteth the mountains in a blaze,
So pursue them with thy tempest, And terrify them with thy storm!
Cover their faces with shame, That they may seek thy name, O LORD!
Let them be confounded! Yea, let them be put to shame, and perish!
That they may know that thy name alone is Jehovah; That thou art the Most High over all the earth.

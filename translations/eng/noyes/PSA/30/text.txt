I will extol thee, O LORD! for thou hast lifted me up, And hast not suffered my enemies to rejoice over me.
O Jehovah, my God! I called upon thee, and thou hast healed me!
O LORD! thou hast raised me up from the underworld; Thou hast kept me alive, that I should not go down to the pit.
Sing unto the LORD, O ye his servants! And praise his holy name!
For his anger endureth but a moment, But his favor through life; In the evening sorrow may be a guest, But joy cometh in the morning.
I said in my prosperity, "I shall never be moved!"
Thou, O LORD! by thy favor, hast made my mountain to stand strong; Thou didst hide thy face, and I was troubled!
I cried unto thee, O LORD! To the LORD I made supplication:
"What will my blood profit thee, that I should go down to the pit? Can dust praise thee? Can it declare thy faithfulness?
Hear, O LORD! and have pity upon me! Be thou, LORD! my helper!"
Thou didst turn my mourning into dancing; Thou didst loose my sackcloth, and gird me with gladness.
Therefore I will sing praise to thee, and not be silent. O Jehovah, my God! I will give thanks to thee for ever!

When Israel came forth from Egypt, The house of Jacob from a people of strange language,
Judah was his sanctuary, And Israel his dominion.
The sea beheld, and fled; The Jordan turned back.
The mountains skipped like rams, And the hills like lambs.
What aileth thee, O thou sea! that thou fleest? Thou, Jordan, that thou runnest back?
Ye mountains, that ye skip like rams, And ye hills like lambs?
Tremble, O earth! at the presence of the Lord, At the presence of the God of Jacob;
Who turned the rock into a standing lake, And the flint into a fountain of water!

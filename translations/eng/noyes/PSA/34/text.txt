I will bless the LORD at all times; His praise shall continually be in my mouth.
In the LORD doth my soul boast; Let the afflicted hear, and rejoice!
O magnify the LORD with me, And let us exalt his name together!
I sought the LORD, and he heard me, And delivered me from all my fears.
Look up to him, and ye shall have light; Your faces shall never be ashamed.
This afflicted man cried, and the LORD heard, And saved him from all his troubles.
The angels of the LORD encamp around those who fear him, And deliver them.
O taste, and see how good is the LORD! Happy the man who trusteth in him!
O fear the LORD, ye his servants! For to those who fear him there shall be no want.
Young lions want, and suffer hunger; But they who fear the LORD want no good thing.
Come, ye children, hearken to me! I will teach you the fear of the LORD.
Who is he that loveth life, And desireth many days, in which he may see good?
Guard well thy tongue from evil, And thy lips from speaking guile!
Depart from evil, and do good; Seek peace, and pursue it!
The eyes of the LORD are upon the righteous, And his ears are open to their cry.
But the face of the LORD is against evil-doers, To cut off their remembrance from the earth.
The righteous cry, and the LORD heareth, And delivereth them from all their troubles.
The LORD is near to them that are of a broken heart, And saveth such as are of a contrite spirit.
Many are the afflictions of the righteous; But the LORD delivereth him from them all.
He guardeth all his bones; Not one of them shall be broken.
Calamity destroyeth the wicked, And they who hate the righteous suffer for it.
The LORD redeemeth the life of his servants, And none that put their trust in him will suffer for it.

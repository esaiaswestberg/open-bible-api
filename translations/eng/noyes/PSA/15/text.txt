LORD, who shall abide at thy tabernacle? Who shall dwell upon thy holy hill?
He that walketh uprightly, and doeth righteousness, And speaketh the truth from his heart;
He that slandereth not with his tongue, That doeth no injury to his neighbor, And uttereth no reproach against his neighbor;
In whose eyes a vile person is contemned; But who honoreth them that fear the LORD; Who sweareth to his own hurt, and changeth not;
He that lendeth not his money for interest, And taketh not a bribe against the innocent: He that doeth these things shall never be moved.

O LORD! rebuke me not in thine anger; Chasten me not in thy hot displeasure!
Have pity upon me, O LORD! for I am weak; Heal me, O LORD! for my bones tremble!
My soul, also, is sore troubled; And thou, O LORD! how long—?
Return, O LORD! and deliver me; Oh, save me according to thy mercy!
For in death no praise is given to thee; In the underworld who can give thee thanks?
I am weary with my groaning; All the night I make my bed to swim, And drench my couch with my tears.
Mine eye is wasted with grief; It hath become old because of all my enemies.
Depart from me, all ye that do iniquity; For the LORD heareth the voice of my weeping.
The LORD heareth my supplication; The LORD accepteth my prayer.
All my enemies shall be ashamed and utterly confounded; They shall be turned back, and put to shame suddenly.

May Jehovah hear thee in the day of trouble; May the name of the God of Jacob defend thee!
May he send thee help from his sanctuary, And strengthen thee out of Zion!
May he have regard to all thine offerings, And accept thy burnt sacrifice! [Pause.]
May he grant thee thy heart’s desire, And fulfill all thy purposes!
We will rejoice in thy protection, And in the name of our God will we set up our banners, When Jehovah hath fulfilled all thy petitions.
Now I know that Jehovah helpeth his anointed; That he heareth him from his holy heaven, And aideth him with the saving strength of his right hand.
Some glory in chariots, and some in horses, But we in the name of Jehovah our God.
They stumble and fall, But we stand and are erect.
The LORD save the king! May he hear us when we call!

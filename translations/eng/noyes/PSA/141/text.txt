I cry to thee, O LORD! make haste unto me! Give ear to my voice, when I cry unto thee!
Let my prayer come before thee as incense, And the lifting-up of my hands, as the evening sacrifice!
Set a watch, O LORD! before my mouth; Guard the door of my lips!
Let not my heart incline to any evil thing; Let me not practise wickedness with the doers of iniquity, And let me not eat of their delicacies!
Let the righteous smite me,—it shall be a kindness; Let him reprove me, and it shall be oil for my head; Let him do it again, and my head shall not refuse it; But now I pray against their wickedness!
When their judges are hurled over the side of the rock, They shall hear how pleasant are my words.
So are our bones scattered at the mouth of the underworld, As when one furroweth and ploweth up the land.
But to thee do my eyes look, O Lord Jehovah! In thee is my trust; Let not my life be poured out!
Preserve me from the snares which they have laid for me, And from the nets of evil-doers!
Let the wicked fall together into their own traps, Whilst I make my escape!

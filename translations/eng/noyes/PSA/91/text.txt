He who sitteth under the shelter of the Most High Maketh his abode in the shadow of the Almighty.
I say to the LORD, Thou art my refuge and my fortress; My God, in whom I trust.
Surely he will deliver thee from the snare of the fowler, And from the wasting pestilence;
He will cover thee with his feathers, And under his wings shalt thou find refuge; His faithfulness shall be thy shield and buckler.
Thou shalt not be afraid of the terror of the night, Nor of the arrow that flieth by day;
Nor of the pestilence that walketh in darkness, Nor of the plague that destroyeth at noonday.
A thousand shall fall by thy side, And ten thousand at thy right hand; But thee it shall not touch.
Thou shalt only behold with thine eyes, And see the recompense of the wicked.
Because thou hast made the LORD thy refuge, And the Most High thy habitation,
No evil shall befall thee, Nor any plague come near thy dwelling.
For he will give his angels charge over thee, To guard thee in all thy ways.
They shall bear thee up in their hands, Lest thou dash thy foot against a stone.
Thou shalt tread upon the lion and the adder; The young lion and the dragon shalt thou trample under foot.
"Because he loveth me, I will deliver him; I will set him on high, because he knoweth my name.
When he calleth upon me, I will answer him; I will be with him in trouble; I will deliver him, and bring him to honor.
With long life will I satisfy him, And show him my salvation."

Except the LORD build the house, The builders labor in vain; Except the LORD guard the city, The watchman waketh in vain.
In vain ye rise up early, and go to rest late, And eat the bread of care! The same giveth he his beloved one in sleep.
Behold! sons are an inheritance from the LORD, And the fruit of the womb is his gift.
As arrows in the hand of the warrior, So are the sons of young men:
Happy the man that hath his quiver full of them! They shall not be put to shame, When they speak with adversaries in the gate.

Give ear to my words, O LORD; Have regard to my cry!
Listen to the voice of my supplication, my King and my God! For to thee do I address my prayer.
In the morning shalt thou hear my voice, O LORD! In the morning will I address my prayer to thee, and look for help.
For thou art not a God that hath pleasure in wickedness; The unrighteous man dwelleth not with thee.
The haughty shall not stand in thy sight; Thou hatest all that do iniquity.
Thou destroyest them that speak falsehood; The man of blood and deceit the LORD abhorreth.
But I, through thy great goodness, will come to thy house; In thy fear will I worship at thy holy temple.
Lead me, O LORD! in thy righteousness, because of mine enemies; Make thy path straight before my face!
For in their mouth there is no truth; Their heart is malignity; Their throat is an open sepulchre; They flatter with their tongue.
Requite them, O God! Let them be confounded in their devices; Cast them out for the multitude of their transgressions; For against thee have they rebelled!
But let all, that put their trust in thee, rejoice; Let them ever shout for joy, because thou defendest them; Let them, that love thy name, be joyful in thee!
For thou, O LORD! dost bless the righteous; With favor dost thou encompass him, as with a shield.

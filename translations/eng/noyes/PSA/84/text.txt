How lovely are thy tabernacles, O LORD of hosts!
My soul longeth, yea, fainteth, for the courts of the LORD; My heart and my flesh cry aloud for the living God.
The very sparrow findeth an abode, And the swallow a nest, where they may lay their young, By thine altars, O LORD of hosts, My king and my God!
Happy they who dwell in thy house, Who are continually praising thee! [Pause.]
Happy the man whose glory is in thee, In whose heart are the ways [to Jerusalem]!
Passing through the valley of Baca, they make it a fountain; and the early rain covereth it with blessings.
They go on from strength to strength; Every one of them appeareth before God in Zion.
Hear my prayer, O LORD, God of hosts! Give ear, O God of Jacob! [Pause.]
Look down, O God! our shield, And behold the face of thine anointed!
For a day spent in thy courts is better than a thousand: I would rather stand on the threshold of the house of my God, Than dwell in the tents of wickedness.
For the LORD God is a sun and a shield; The LORD giveth grace and glory; No good thing doth he withhold From them that walk uprightly.
O LORD of hosts! Happy the man who trusteth in thee!

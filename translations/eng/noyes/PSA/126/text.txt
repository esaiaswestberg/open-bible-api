When the LORD brought back the captivity of Zion, We were like them that dream.
Then was our mouth filled with laughter, And our tongue with singing. Then said they among the nations, "The LORD hath done great things for them!"
Yea, the LORD hath done great things for us, For which we are glad.
Bring back, O LORD! our captivity, Like streams in the South!
They who sow in tears Shall reap in joy.
Yea, he goeth forth weeping, bearing his seed; He shall surely come back rejoicing, bearing his sheaves.

Why do the heathen rage, And the nations meditate a vain thing?
Why do the kings of the earth rise up, And the princes combine together, Against Jehovah, and against his anointed king?
"Let us break their bonds asunder; Let us cast away from us their fetters!"
He that sitteth in heaven will laugh; The Lord will have them in derision.
Then shall he speak to them in his wrath, And confound them in his hot displeasure.
"I myself have anointed my king, Upon Zion, my holy hill!"
I will declare the decree of Jehovah: He hath said to me, "Thou art my son; This day I have begotten thee.
Ask of me, and I will give thee the nations for thine inheritance, And the ends of the earth for thy possession.
Thou shalt break them with a rod of iron; Thou shalt dash them in pieces like a potter’s vessel."
Be wise, therefore, O ye kings! Be admonished, ye rulers of the earth!
Be subject to Jehovah with awe, And fear with trembling!
Kiss the son, lest He be angry, and ye perish in your way; For soon shall his wrath be kindled. Happy are all they who seek refuge in him.

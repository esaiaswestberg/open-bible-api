Save me, O God! by thy name, And by thy strength defend my cause!
O God! hear my prayer, Give ear to the words of my mouth!
For enemies have risen up against me, And oppressors seek my life; They have not set God before their eyes. [Pause.]
Behold! God is my helper; The Lord is the support of my life.
He will repay evil to my enemies; For thy truth’s sake, O God! cut them off!
With a willing heart will I sacrifice to thee; I will praise thy name, O LORD! for it is good;
For thou hast delivered me from all trouble, So that my eye hath looked with joy upon my enemies!

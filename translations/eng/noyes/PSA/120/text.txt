In my distress I called upon the LORD, And he answered me.
O LORD! deliver me from lying lips, From the deceitful tongue!
What profit to thee, Or what advantage to thee, is the false tongue?
It is like the sharp arrows of the mighty man; Like coals of the juniper.
Alas for me, that I sojourn in Mesech, That I dwell in the tents of Kedar!
Too long have I dwelt With them that hate peace!
I am for peace; yet, when I speak for it, They are for war.

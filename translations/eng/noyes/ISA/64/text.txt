O that thou wouldst rend the heavens, and come down; That the mountains might tremble at thy presence,
As fire kindleth the dry stubble, As fire causeth water to boil, To make known thy name to thine adversaries, That the nations might tremble at thy presence;
As thou once didst wonderful things, which we looked not for, And camest down, so that the mountains trembled at thy presence.
For never have men heard, nor perceived by the ear, Nor hath eye seen, a God beside thee. Who doeth such things for those that trust in him.
Thou art the friend of those who joyfully do righteousness, Those who remember thee in thy ways. Behold, thou art angry, and we are punished; Long doth the punishment endure, before we are delivered.
We are all of us an unclean thing; Like a filthy garment is all our righteousness; We are all withered like a leaf, And our sins, like a storm, have blown us away.
There is none that calleth upon thy name, That stirreth himself up to cleave to thee; For thou hidest thy face from us, And lettest us perish by our iniquities.
But now, O Jehovah, thou art our father; We are the clay, and thou hast formed us; We are all of us the work of thy hands.
Be not wroth, O Jehovah, to the uttermost, Nor remember our iniquity forever! Behold, look upon us, we beseech thee, we are all thy people!
Thy holy cities have become a wilderness; Zion is become a wilderness, Jerusalem a desolation.
Our holy and glorious house, Where our fathers praised thee, Is burned with fire, And all our precious things are laid waste.
Wilt thou contain thyself at these things, O Jehovah, Wilt thou keep silence, and still grievously afflict us?

In that day shall seven women lay hold of one man saying: We will eat our own bread, And wear our own garments, Only let us be called by thy name, And take away our reproach!
In that day shall the increase of Jehovah be glorious and honorable, And the fruit of the land excellent and beautiful, For them that have escaped of Israel.
All that remain in Zion, And all that are left in Jerusalem, Shall be called holy; Every one that is written down for life in Jerusalem.
When the Lord shall have washed away the filth of the daughters of Zion, And have removed the blood of Jerusalem from the midst of her, By a spirit of judgment and a spirit of destruction,
Then shall Jehovah create upon the whole extent of mount Zion, and upon her places of assembly, A cloud and smoke by day, And the brightness of a flaming fire by night; Yea, for all that is glorious there shall be a shelter;
There shall be a tent by day for a shadow from the heat, And for a refuge and shelter from the storm and rain.

In the year in which Tartan, being sent by Sargon, the king of Assyria, came to Ashdod, and fought against Ashdod, and took it,
at that time spake Jehovah through Isaiah the son of Amoz in this manner: Go, and loose the sackcloth from thy loins, and put off thy shoes from thy feet. And he did so, walking naked and barefoot.
And Jehovah said: As my servant Isaiah hath walked naked and barefoot three years, a sign and a token for Egypt and Ethiopia,
so shall the king of Assyria lead the captives of Egypt, and prisoners of Ethiopia, young and old, naked and barefoot, with their hind parts uncovered, to the shame of the Egyptians.
Then shall they be afraid and ashamed on account of Ethiopia their trust, and of Egypt their glory.
The inhabitant of this coast shall say in that day, "Behold, so is it with them in whom we trusted, and to whom we fled for help, that we might be delivered from the king of Assyria. How then shall we escape?"

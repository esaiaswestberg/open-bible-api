For Zion’s sake I will not keep silence, And for Jerusalem’s sake I will not rest, Until her deliverance break forth like the shining light, And her salvation like a blazing torch.
Then shall the nations see thy prosperity, And all the kings thy glory; Thou shalt be called by a new name, Which the mouth of Jehovah shall give thee.
Thou shalt be a beautiful crown in the hand of Jehovah, A royal diadem in the hand of thy God.
No more shalt thou be called the Desolate, And thy land, the Forsaken. But thou shall be named My-delight-is-in-her. And thy land the wedded Matron. For Jehovah shall delight in thee, And thy land shall be married.
For as a young man weddeth a virgin. So shall thy children wed thee. And as a bridegroom rejoiceth in his bride, So shall thy God rejoice in thee.
Upon thy walls, O Jerusalem, have I set watchmen; All the day, and all the night, shall they not keep silence; O ye that praise Jehovah, keep not silence,
And give him no rest, Until he establish Jerusalem, and make her a praise in the earth!
Jehovah hath sworn by his right hand, and his mighty arm: No more will I give thy corn to be food for thine enemies, Nor shall the sons of the stranger drink thy wine, for which thou hast labored.
But they that reap the harvest shall eat it, And praise Jehovah; And they that gather the vintage shall drink it, In my holy comets.
Pass ye, pass ye through the gates; Prepare the way for the people; Cast ye up, cast ye up the highway, Clear it from the stones; Lift up on high a standard for the tribes!
Behold, Jehovah proclaimeth to the end of the earth: "Say ye to the daughter of Zion, Behold, thy Deliverer cometh! Behold, his reward is with him, and his recompense before him!"
They shall be called, The holy people, The redeemed of Jehovah. And thou shalt be called, The Sought out, The Not forsaken City.

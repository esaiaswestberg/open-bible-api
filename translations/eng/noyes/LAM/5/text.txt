Remember, O Jehovah, what is come upon us! Look down and behold our reproach!
Our inheritance is fallen to strangers, Our houses to aliens.
We are orphans; we are without a father; Our mothers are as widows.
Our water we drink for money; Our wood is sold to us.
With the yoke upon our necks, we are driven; We are wearied, and have no rest.
We have given the hand to the Egyptians, And to the Assyrians, to be satisfied with bread.
Our fathers sinned; they are no more, And we bear their iniquities.
Servants rule over us; There is none that delivereth out of their hand.
With the peril of our lives we get our bread, Because of the sword of the wilderness.
Our skin is parched like an oven Because of the burnings of hunger.
Matrons in Zion have they ravished, And maidens in the cities of Judah.
Princes were hanged up by their hand; The faces of the elders were not honored.
Young men carried millstones, And boys fell under burdens of wood.
The elders sit no more at the gate; The young men have ceased from their music.
The joy of our heart is at an end; Our dancing is turned into mourning.
The crown is fallen from our head; Woe unto us, that we have sinned!
For this is our heart faint, For these things our eyes are dim;
On account of mount Zion, which is desolate; Foxes roam over it.
But thou, O Jehovah, sittest as king forever; Thy throne endureth from generation to generation.
Wherefore dost thou wholly forget us, And abandon us, for so long a time?
Turn us again to thee, O Jehovah, that we may be restored! Renew our days as of old!
For shouldst thou utterly reject us? Shouldst thou be so exceedingly wroth against us?

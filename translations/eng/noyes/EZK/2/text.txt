And he said to me, Son of man, stand upon thy feet, and I will speak with thee.
And the spirit entered into me when he spoke to me, and set me upon my feet; and I heard him that spake with me.
And he said to me, Son of man, I send thee to the sons of Israel, to a rebellious nation, that hath rebelled against me; they and their fathers have rebelled against me to this very day.
Brazen-faced and stiff-hearted are the sons to whom I send thee. And thou shalt say to them, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah.
And whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear, for they are a rebellious house, yet shall they know that a prophet is in the midst of them.
And thou, son of man, be not afraid of them, and of their words be not afraid, though they be briers and thorns toward thee, and though thou dwell among scorpions; be not afraid of their words, nor be dismayed at their looks, for they are a rebellious house.
Speak thou my words to them, whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear, for they are most rebellious.
But thou, son of man, hear what I say to thee! Be not thou rebellious, like that rebellious house. Open thy mouth, and eat that which I give thee.
And when I looked, behold, a hand was put forth to me; and lo, a book-roll was therein.
And he spread it before me, and it was written within and without. And therein was written lamentation and mourning and woe.

Wherefore, when we could no longer forbear, we chose to be left at Athens alone,
and sent Timothy, our brother and a fellow-laborer with God in the gospel of Christ, to establish you, and to encourage you in your faith,
so that no one should be shaken by these afflictions; for yourselves know that to this we are appointed;
for even when we were with you, we told you before that we are to suffer affliction, just as it came to pass, and ye know.
For this cause, when I too could no longer forbear, I sent in order to know your faith, lest by some means the tempter might have tempted you, and our labor should prove in vain.
But when Timothy just now came to us from you, and brought us good tidings of your faith and love, and that ye have good remembrance of us always, desiring greatly to see us, as we also to see you;
for this cause, brethren, we were comforted over you in all our distress and affliction by your faith;
for now we live, if ye stand fast in the Lord.
For what thanks can we render to God for you, for all the joy wherewith we rejoice for your sakes before our God;
night and day praying exceedingly that we may see your face, and may supply that which is lacking in your faith?
Now God himself, our Father, and our Lord Jesus direct our way to you;
and the Lord make you to increase and abound in love toward one another and toward all, even as we do in love toward you;
in order that he may establish your hearts unblamable in holiness before God, our Father, at the coming of our Lord Jesus with all his holy ones.

Persevere in prayer, being watchful therein with thanksgiving;
praying at the same time for us also, that God may open to us a door for the word, to speak the mystery of Christ, for the sake of which I am also in bonds;

Walk in wisdom toward them that are without, buying up opportunities.
Let your speech be always with grace, seasoned with salt, that ye may know how ye ought to answer every one.
Of all my affairs Tychicus will inform you, the beloved brother and faithful minister and fellow-servant in the Lord;

Aristarchus, my fellow-prisoner, saluteth you, and Mark, the cousin of Barnabas, concerning whom ye received directions (if he come to you, receive him),

And say to Archippus, Take heed to the ministry which thou hast received in the Lord, that thou fulfill it.
The salutation by the hand of me, Paul. Remember my bonds. Grace be with you.

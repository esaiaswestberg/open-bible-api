This is the third time I am coming to you. In the mouth of two or three witnesses shall every word be established.
I said before, and now say beforehand, as when present the second time, so also absent now, to those who have sinned before, and to all the others, that if I come again, I will not spare;
since ye seek a proof of Christ speaking in me, who towards you is not weak, but is mighty among you.
For though he was crucified through weakness, yet he liveth through the power of God; for we also are weak in him, but we shall live together with him by the power of God toward you.
Try yourselves, whether ye are in the faith; prove your own selves. Know ye not your own selves, that Christ Jesus is in you, unless ye are unapproved?
But I trust that ye shall know, that we are not unapproved.
Now we pray to God that ye do no evil; not in order that we may appear approved, but that ye may do what is good, though we be as unapproved.
For we have no power against the truth, but for the truth.
For we are glad, when we are weak, and ye are strong; this also we pray for, even your perfection.
For this cause I write these things while absent, that when present I may not use sharpness, according to the power which the Lord gave me for edification, and not for destruction.
Finally, brethren, farewell! Be perfect, be of good comfort, be of one mind, live in peace; and the God of love and peace shall be with you.
Salute one another with a holy kiss.
All the saints salute you.
The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the partaking of the Holy Spirit, be with you all.

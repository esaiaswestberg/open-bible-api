I lifted up mine eyes again, and looked, and behold, a man with a measuring-line in his hand.
Then said I, Whither goest thou? And he said to me, To measure Jerusalem, to see what is the breadth thereof, and what is the length thereof.
And behold, the angel who talked with me went forth, and another angel went forth to meet him,
and said to him, Run, speak to that young man, saying: Jerusalem shall be inhabited without walls On account of the multitude of men and of cattle within her.
And I will be to her, saith Jehovah, A wall of fire round about, And glory will I be within her.
Ho! ho! flee ye out of the land of the North, saith Jehovah; For toward the four winds of heaven have I scattered you abroad, saith Jehovah.
Ho, Zion, escape, Thou that dwellest with the daughter of Babylon!
For thus saith Jehovah of hosts: For glory hath he sent me to the nations which plundered you; (For he that toucheth you toucheth the apple of his eye.)
For, behold, I will shake my hand over them, And they shall be a spoil to those that served them; And ye shall know that Jehovah of hosts hath sent me.
Sing and rejoice, O daughter of Zion! For, behold, I will come, And I will dwell in the midst of thee, saith Jehovah;
And many nations shall join themselves to Jehovah in that day, And shall be my people; And I will dwell in the midst of thee; And thou shalt know that Jehovah of hosts hath sent me to thee.
And Jehovah will possess Judah as his portion in the holy land, And will again choose Jerusalem.
Be silent, all flesh, before Jehovah! For he riseth up from his holy habitation.

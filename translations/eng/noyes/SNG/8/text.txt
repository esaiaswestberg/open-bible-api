O that thou wert as my brother, That sucked the breast of my mother! When I found thee abroad, I might kiss thee; And for it no one would deride me.
I will lead thee, and bring thee into my mother’s house, that thou mayst teach me; I will give thee spiced wine to drink, and the juice of my pomegranates.
His left hand is under my head, And his right hand embraceth me.
[Lov.] I charge you, O ye daughters of Jerusalem! That ye stir not up, nor awake my love, Till she please!
[Lad.] Who is this that cometh up from the wilderness, Leaning upon her beloved? [M.] Under the apple-tree I awakened thee; There thy mother brought thee forth; There she that bore thee brought thee forth!
O set me as a seal upon thy heart, As a seal upon thine arm! For love is strong as death; True love is firm as the grave: Its flames are flames of fire, The fire of Jehovah.
Many waters cannot quench love, Nor can floods drown it. Would a man give all the wealth of his house for love, It would be utterly contemned.
[Br.] We have a sister who is yet young; She is yet without breasts. What shall we do with our sister, When she shall be spoken for?
If she be a wall, We will build upon it a silver tower; If she be an open gate, We will inclose her with planks of cedar.
[Sis.] I am a wall, and my breasts like towers; Therefore am I become in his eyes as one that findeth peace.
Solomon had a vineyard at Baal-hamon; He let out the vineyard to keepers; Every one was to bring a thousand shekels of silver for its fruit.
My vineyard is before my eyes. Be thine the thousand, O Solomon! And two hundred to the keepers of its fruit!
[Lov.] Thou that dwellest in the gardens! Friends listen to thy voice; Let me hear thee!
Fly, my beloved! like a gazelle, or a young hind, Upon the mountains of spices.

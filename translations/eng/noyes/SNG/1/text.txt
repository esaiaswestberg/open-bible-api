The Song of Songs, which is by Solomon.
[M.] O that he would kiss me with one of the kisses of his mouth! For thy love is better than wine.
Because of the savor of thy precious perfumes, (Thy name is like fragrant oil poured forth,) Therefore do the virgins love thee.
Draw me after thee; let us run! The king hath led me to his chambers! We will be glad and rejoice in thee; We will praise thy love more than wine. Justly do they love thee!
I am black, but comely, O ye daughters of Jerusalem, As the tents of Kedar, as the curtains of Solomon.
Gaze not upon me because I am black, Because the sun hath looked upon me! My mother’s sons were angry with me; They made me keeper of the vineyards; My vineyard, my own, have I not kept.
Tell me, thou whom my soul loveth, where thou feedest thy flock, Where thou leadest it to rest at noon; For why should I be like a veiled one by the flocks of thy companions?
[Lad.] If thou know not, O thou fairest among women, Trace thou thy way by the tracks of the flock, And feed thy kids beside the shepherds’ tents!
[Lov.] To the horses in the chariots of Pharaoh Do I compare thee, my love!
Comely are thy cheeks with rows of jewels, Thy neck with strings of pearls.
Golden chains will we make for thee, With studs of silver.
[M.] While the king reclineth at his table, My spikenard sendeth forth its fragrance.
A bunch of myrrh is my beloved to me; He shall abide between my breasts.
My beloved is to me a cluster of henna-flowers From the gardens of Engedi.
[Lov.] Behold, thou art fair, my love; behold, thou art fair! Thine eyes are doves.
[M.] Behold, thou art fair, my beloved, yea, lovely; And green is our bed.
The cedars are the beams of our house, And its roof the cypresses.

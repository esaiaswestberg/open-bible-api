Now it came to pass, as David dwelt in his house, that David said to Nathan, the prophet, Behold, I dwell in a house of cedars, and the ark of the covenant of the LORD under curtains.
Then Nathan said unto David, Do all that [is] in thy heart for God [is] with thee.
And it came to pass the same night that the word of God came to Nathan, saying,
Go and tell David my servant, Thus hath the LORD said, Thou shalt not build me a house to dwell in,
for I have not dwelt in a house since the day that I brought up Israel unto this day, but have gone from tent to tent, and from [one] tabernacle [to another].
Wherever I have walked with all Israel, did I speak a word to any of the judges of Israel, whom I commanded to feed my people, saying, Why have ye not built me a house of cedars?
Now, therefore, thus shalt thou say unto my servant David, Thus hath the LORD of the hosts said, I took thee from the sheepfold, from following the sheep that thou should be ruler over my people Israel;
and I have been with thee wherever thou hast walked and have cut off all thy enemies from before thee and have made thee a name like the name of the great men that [are] in the earth.
Likewise I have ordained a place for my people Israel and have planted him that he dwell by himself and no longer be moved; neither shall the sons of iniquity waste them any more, as before,
since the time that I commanded judges [to be] over my people Israel. I have humbled all thy enemies and announce unto thee that the LORD will build thee a house.
And it shall come to pass, when thy days are fulfilled to go to be with thy fathers, that I will raise up thy seed after thee, which shall be of thy sons; and I will establish his kingdom.
He shall build me a house, and I will establish his throne eternally.
I will be his father, and he shall be my son; and I will not take my mercy away from him, as I took [it] from [him] that was before thee;
but I will confirm him in my house and in my kingdom for ever, and his throne shall be established for evermore.
According to all these words, and according to all this vision, so did Nathan speak unto David.
And David, the king, came and sat before the LORD and said, Who [am] I, O LORD God, and what [is] my house, that thou hast brought me here?
And [yet] this was a small thing in thy eyes, O God, for thou hast [also] spoken of thy servant's house for a great while to come and hast regarded me according to the estate of a man of high degree, O LORD God.
What more can David add asking thee to glorify thy servant? For thou knowest thy servant.
O LORD, for thy servant's sake and according to thy own heart, thou hast done all this greatness, in making known all thy great things.
O LORD, [there is] none like thee, neither [is there any] God beside thee, according to all that we have heard with our ears.
And what one nation in the earth [is] like thy people Israel, whom God went to ransom [to be] his own people, to make thee a name of greatness and terribleness, by driving out the Gentiles from before thy people, whom thou didst redeem out of Egypt?
For thy people Israel didst thou make thy own people for ever, and thou, LORD, didst become their God.
Therefore, now, LORD, let the thing that thou hast spoken concerning thy servant and concerning his house be established for ever and do as thou hast said.
Let it even be established, that thy name may be magnified for ever, that it may be said, The LORD of the hosts, God of Israel, is God unto Israel; and [let] the house of David thy servant [be] established before thee.
For thou, O my God, hast told thy servant that thou wilt build him a house; therefore, thy servant has found [in his heart] to pray before thee.
And now, LORD, thou art God and hast promised this goodness unto thy servant;
now it has pleased thee to bless the house of thy servant, that it may be before thee for ever; for thou, O LORD, hast blessed it, and [it shall be] blessed for ever.:

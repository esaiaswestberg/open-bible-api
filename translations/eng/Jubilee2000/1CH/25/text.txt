Moreover David and the captains of the host separated unto the ministry the sons of Asaph and of Heman and of Jeduthun, who should prophesy with harps, with psalteries, and with cymbals; and the number of men that were [suitable] for the work of their [respective] ministry was,
of the sons of Asaph: Zaccur, Joseph, Nethaniah, and Asarelah, the sons of Asaph under the direction of Asaph, who prophesied at the hand of the king.
Of Jeduthun: the sons of Jeduthun: Gedaliah, Zeri, Jeshaiah, Hashabiah, and Mattithiah, six, under the hand of their father Jeduthun, who prophesied with a harp, to give thanks and to praise the LORD.
Of Heman: the sons of Heman: Bukkiah, Mattaniah, Uzziel, Shebuel, Jerimoth, Hananiah, Hanani, Eliathah, Giddalti, and Romamtiezer, Joshbekashah, Mallothi, Hothir, [and] Mahazioth.
All these [were] the sons of Heman, the king's seer, in the words of God, to lift up the horn. And God gave to Heman fourteen sons and three daughters.
All these [were] under the direction of their father for song [in] the house of the LORD, with cymbals, psalteries, and harps, for the ministry of the house of God, under the hand of the king, of Asaph, of Jeduthun, and of Heman.
So the number of them, with their brethren that were instructed in the songs of the LORD, [even] all that had understanding, was two hundred eighty-eight.
And they cast lots, ward against [ward], the small as well as the great, the one with understanding as well as the disciple.

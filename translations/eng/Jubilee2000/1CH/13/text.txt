And David consulted with the captains of thousands and hundreds [and] with all the princes.
And David said unto all the congregation of Israel, If [it seems] good unto you and unto the LORD our God, let us send everywhere to call our brethren who have remained in all the lands of Israel and with them [also] the priests and Levites [who are] in their cities [and] suburbs, that they may gather themselves unto us;
and let us bring again the ark of our God to us, for from the time of Saul we have not paid attention to it.
And all the congregation said to do so, for the thing seemed right in the eyes of all the people.
So David gathered all Israel together, from Shihor of Egypt even unto the entering of Hemath, to bring the ark of God from Kirjathjearim.
And David went up with all Israel to Baalah, [that is], to Kirjathjearim, which is in Judah, to bring up from there the ark of God the LORD, who dwells [between] the cherubim, whose name is called [on it].

And David and all Israel played before God with all [their] might, with songs and with harps and with psalteries and with timbrels and with cymbals and with trumpets.
And when they came unto the threshingfloor of Chidon, Uzza put forth his hand to hold the ark, for the oxen stumbled.
And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Uzza, and he smote him because he had put his hand to the ark, and there he died before God.
And David was displeased because the LORD had made a breach upon Uzza; therefore, that place is called Perezuzza to this day.
And David was afraid of God that day, saying, How shall I bring the ark of God [home] to me?
So David did not bring the ark [home] to himself to the city of David but carried it into the house of Obededom, the Gittite.
And the ark of God remained with the household of Obededom in his house three months. And the LORD blessed the household of Obededom and all that he had.:

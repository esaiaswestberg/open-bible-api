So I returned and considered all the violence that is done under the sun and behold the tears of [such as are] oppressed, and they have no comforter; and on the side of their oppressors [there was] power; but the [oppressed] had no comforter.
Therefore I praised the dead who are already dead more than the living who are yet alive.
And [I thought that] better [is he] than both of them who has not yet been who has not seen the evil works that are done under the sun.
Again, I considered all travail and every right work, that for this a man is envied of his neighbour. This [is] also vanity and vexation of spirit.
The fool folds his hands together and eats his own flesh.
Better [is] a handful [with] rest than both the hands full [with] travail and vexation of spirit.
Then I returned, and I saw [another] vanity under the sun.
It is the [man] who is alone, without a successor, who has neither son nor brother; yet [is there] no end of all his labour; neither is his eye satisfied with riches; neither [saith he], For whom do I labour and bereave my soul of good? This [is] also vanity and sore travail.
Two [are] better than one because they have a better reward for their labour.
For if they fall, the one will lift up his fellow; but woe to him [that is] alone when he falls, for [he has] not another to help him up.
Again, if two sleep together, then they have heat, but how can one be warm [alone]?
And if one prevails against him, two shall withstand him; and a threefold cord is not quickly broken.
Better [is] a poor and a wise child than an old and foolish king who will no longer be admonished.
For he came out of prison to reign, even though he was born poor into his kingdom.
I saw all the living who are under the sun walking with the child, the successor that shall stand up in his stead.
[There is] no end of all the people that have been before them; those also that come after shall not be content in him. Surely this also [is] vanity and vexation of spirit.:

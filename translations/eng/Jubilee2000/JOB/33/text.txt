Therefore, Job, hear now my reasons, and hearken to all my words.
Behold, now I shall open my mouth, my tongue shall speak in my mouth.
My reasons declare the uprightness of my heart; and my lips shall utter pure knowledge.
The Spirit of God made me, and the breath of the Almighty gave me life.
If thou canst answer me, set [thy words] in order before me, stand up.
Behold, I [am] according to thy wish in God's stead; I also am formed out of the clay.
Behold, my terror shall not make thee afraid, neither shall my hand be heavy upon thee.
Surely thou hast spoken in my hearing, and I have heard the voice of [thy] words, [saying],
I am clean without rebellion, I [am] innocent; neither [is there] iniquity in me.
Behold, [God] sought occasions against me, he counts me for his enemy,
he put my feet in the stocks, he guards all my paths.
Behold, [in] this thou art not just; I will answer thee, that God is greater than man.
Why dost thou strive against him? For he will not answer all of thy words.
Nevertheless, in one or two manners God speaks to the one who does not see.
In a dream, in a vision of the night, when deep sleep falls upon men, in slumberings upon the bed;
then he opens the ears of men and seals their instruction,
that he may withdraw the man [from his own] work and cover the man from pride.
[Thus] he keeps back his soul from the pit and his life from perishing by the sword.
He is chastened also upon his bed with strong pain in all his bones,
so that his life abhorrs bread and his soul dainty food.
His flesh is consumed away, that it cannot be seen; and his bones [that] were not seen stick out.
His soul shall draw near to the grave, and his life to those that would bury him.
If there is a messenger with him, an interpreter, one among a thousand, to show unto man his uprightness;
to tell him that [God] had mercy on him, that he delivered him from going down to the pit; that he found a ransom;
his flesh shall become more tender than a child's; and he shall return to the days of his youth.
He shall pray unto God, and he will love him; and he shall see his face with shouts of joy; for he will render unto the man the recompense of his righteousness.
He looks upon men, and [if any] say, I have sinned and perverted [that which was] right, and it did not profit me;
[God] will ransom his soul from going into the pit, and his life shall see the light.
Behold, God does all these thing two and three times with man,
to turn back his soul from the pit, to be enlightened with the light of the living.
Hear me, O Job, hearken unto me; be silent, and I will speak.
If thou hast anything to say, answer me; speak, for I desire to justify thee.
If not, hearken unto me; be silent, and I shall teach thee wisdom.:

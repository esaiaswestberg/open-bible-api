Man [that is] born of a woman [is] of few days and full of trouble.
He comes forth like an open flower and is cut down; he flees as a shadow and does not remain.
And dost thou open thine eyes upon such a one and bring me into judgment with thee?
Who can bring a clean [thing] out of an unclean? No one.
Seeing his days [are] determined, the number of his months [are] with thee, thou hast appointed his bounds that he cannot pass.
If thou should leave him, he will cease [to exist]; until then, he shall desire, as a hireling, his day.
For there is yet hope for a tree, if it is cut down, that it will sprout again and that its tender branch will not cease.
Though its root waxes old in the earth and its trunk is dead in the ground,
at the scent of water it will bud and bring forth boughs like a new plant.
But [when] man shall die and be cut off, and the man shall perish, where shall he be?
The waters from the sea went, and the river ran out, it dried up.
So man lies down and does not rise; until there is no heaven, they shall not awake nor be raised out of their sleep.
O that thou would hide me in Sheol, that thou would keep me covered until thy wrath is past, that thou would appoint me a set time and remember me!
If a man dies, shall he live [again]? All the days of my appointed time I will wait until my transformation comes.
[Then] thou shalt call, and I will answer thee; thou wilt have a desire towards the work of thine hands.
For now thou dost number my steps; thou dost not open up my sin.
My transgression [is] sealed up in a bag, and thou dost sew up my iniquity.
And certainly the mountain that falls is undone, and the rocks are removed out of their place.
The impetuous waters break the stones and wash away the dust of the earth; in like manner thou dost cause man to lose hope.
Thou shalt be stronger than him for ever, and he passes; thou dost change his countenance and send him away.
His sons shall be honoured and he shall not know [of it]; or they shall be afflicted, but he shall not perceive of them.
But [while] his flesh [is] upon him, he shall have pain, and his soul within him shall mourn.:

Moreover, Job continued his parable and said,
As God lives, [who] has taken away my rights; and the Almighty, [who] has made my soul bitter,
that all the while my breath [is] in me, and the spirit of God [is] in my nostrils,
my lips shall not speak iniquity, nor my tongue utter deceit.
In no wise should I justify you; until I die I will not remove my integrity from me.
I hold fast to my righteousness and will not let it go; my heart shall not reproach [me] so long as I live.
Let my enemy be as the wicked and my adversary as the unrighteous.
For what [is] the hope of the hypocrite, though he has stolen much, when God takes away his soul?
Will God hear his cry when the tribulation comes upon him?
Will he delight himself in the Almighty? Will he always call upon God?
I will teach you [what there is] in the hand of God; I will not conceal that which [is] regarding the Almighty.
Behold, all ye yourselves have seen [it]; why then are ye so completely vain?
This [is] the portion of a wicked man with God and the heritage of the violent, [which] they shall receive of the Almighty.
If their sons are multiplied, [it is] for the sword; and his offspring shall not be satisfied with bread.
Those that remain of him shall be buried in death; and their widows shall not weep.
Though he heaps up silver as the dust and prepares raiment as the clay,
he may prepare [it], but the just shall put [it] on, and the innocent shall divide the silver.
He built his house as a moth and as a booth [that] the keeper makes.
The rich man shall lie down, but he shall not be gathered; he shall open his eyes and not see anyone.
Terrors shall take hold on him as waters; a whirlwind shall carry him away in the night.
The east wind shall take him away, and he shall depart; the storm shall catch him up out of his place.
For [God] shall cast down on him and not spare; he would attempt to flee out of his hand.
[Men] shall clap their hands at him, and from his place they shall hiss at him.:

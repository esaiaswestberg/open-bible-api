Moreover, the LORD answered Job and said,
Shall he that contends with the Almighty instruct [him]? Let him that disputes with God answer this.
Then Job answered the LORD and said,
Behold, I am vile; what shall I answer thee? I will lay my hand over my mouth.
Once I have spoken; but I will not answer; even twice, but I will proceed no further.
Then the LORD answered Job out of the whirlwind and said,
Gird up thy loins now like a man; I will ask thee, and explain thou unto me.
Wilt thou disannul my judgment? Wilt thou condemn me, that thou may be justified?
Hast thou an arm like God? And canst thou thunder with a voice like him?
Deck thyself now [with] majesty and excellency; and array thyself with glory and beauty.
Cast abroad the rage of thy wrath; and behold every one [that is] proud and bring him down.
Look on every one [that is] proud, [and] bring him low; and tread down the wicked in their place.
Hide them in the dust together; [and] blindfold their faces in darkness.
Then I will also confess unto thee that thine own right hand can save thee.
Behold now behemoth, which I made with thee; he eats grass as an ox.
Behold now, his strength [is] in his loins, and his force [is] in the navel of his belly.
He moves his tail like a cedar; the sinews of his stones are wrapped together.
His bones [are as] strong as brass; his members [are] like bars of iron.
He is the beginning of the ways of God; he that made him shall make his sword draw near [unto him].
Surely the mountains bring him forth food, where all the beasts of the field play.
He shall lie down under the shade, in the covert of the reeds and of the damp places.
The shady [trees] cover him [with] their shadow; the willows of the brook compass him about.
Behold, he shall drink up a river [and] not change; he trusts that he can draw up the Jordan into his mouth.
His maker shall take him by [the weakness of] his eyes in a snare, and pierce through his nose.:

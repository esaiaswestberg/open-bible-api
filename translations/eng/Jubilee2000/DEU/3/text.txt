Then we turned, and went up the way to Bashan; and Og the king of Bashan, came out against us, he and all his people, to battle at Edrei.
And the LORD said unto me, Fear him not, for I have delivered him and all his people and his land into thy hand, and thou shalt do unto him as thou didst unto Sihon, king of the Amorites, who dwelt at Heshbon.
So the LORD our God delivered into our hand Og also, the king of Bashan, and all his people, and we smote him until none was left to him remaining.
And we took all his cities at that time there was not a city which we did not take from them, sixty cities, all the region of Argob, of the kingdom of Og in Bashan.
All these cities [were] fenced with high walls, gates, and bars besides a great many unwalled towns.
And we utterly destroyed them, as we did unto Sihon, king of Heshbon, utterly destroying every city, men, women, and children.
But all the beasts and the spoil of the cities, we took for a prey to ourselves.
And we [also] took at that time out of the hand of the two kings of the Amorites the land that [was] on this side of the Jordan, from the river of Arnon unto Mount Hermon
([which] Hermon the Sidonians call Sirion and the Amorites call it Shenir) [and]
all the cities of the plain and all Gilead and all Bashan unto Salchah and Edrei, cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan.
For only Og, king of Bashan, had remained of the remnant of giants; behold, his bedstead [was] a bedstead of iron; is it not in Rabbath of the sons of Ammon? Nine cubits [was] the length thereof and four cubits the breadth of it, after the cubit of a man.
And this land, [which] we inherited at that time, from Aroer, which [is] by the river Arnon, and half of mount Gilead and the cities thereof, I gave unto the Reubenites and to the Gadites.
And the rest of Gilead and all Bashan ([fertile ground]), [being] the kingdom of Og, gave I unto the half tribe of Manasseh: all the region of Argob, with all Bashan, which was called the land of giants.
Jair, the son of Manasseh, took all the country of Argob unto the border of Geshuri and Maachathi and called them after his own name, Bashanhavothjair, unto this day.
And I gave Gilead unto Machir.
And unto the Reubenites and unto the Gadites I gave from Gilead even unto the river Arnon, half the valley for a border even unto the river Jabbok, [which is] the border of the sons of Ammon,
the plain also and the Jordan and the border [thereof] from Chinnereth even unto the sea of the plain, [even] the salt sea, under Ashdothpisgah eastward.
And I commanded you at that time, saying, The LORD your God has given you this land to possess it; ye shall pass armed before your brethren, the sons of Israel, all [that are] valiant.
Only your wives and your little ones and your livestock (for I know that ye have much livestock) shall abide in your cities which I have given you
until the LORD has given rest unto your brethren, as well as unto you, and [until] they also inherit the land which the LORD your God has given them beyond the Jordan; [then] shall ye return each man unto his possession, which I have given you.
And I also commanded Joshua at that time, saying, Thine eyes have seen all that the LORD your God has done unto these two kings, so shall the LORD do unto all the kingdoms where thou passest.
Ye shall not fear them, for the LORD your God, he shall fight for you.
And I besought the LORD at that time, saying,
O Lord GOD, thou hast begun to show thy servant thy greatness and thy mighty hand; for what God [is there] in heaven or in earth that can do according to thy works and according to thy mighty acts?
I pray thee, let me go over and see that good land that is beyond the Jordan, that goodly mountain and Lebanon.
But the LORD was angry with me for your sakes and would not hear me, and the LORD said unto me, Let it suffice thee; speak no more unto me of this matter.
Climb up into the top of Pisgah and lift up thine eyes westward and towards the Aquilon and towards the Negev and eastward and behold [it] with thine eyes, for thou shalt not go over this Jordan.
But charge Joshua and encourage him and comfort him, for he shall go over before this people, and he shall cause them to inherit the land which thou shalt see.
So we abode in the valley over against Bethpeor.:

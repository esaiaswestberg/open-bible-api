And King Ahasuerus laid tribute upon the land and [upon] the isles of the sea.
And all the acts of his power and of his might and the declaration of the greatness of Mordecai, unto which the king advanced him, [are] they not written in the book of the Chronicles of the kings of Media and Persia?
For Mordecai, the Jew, [was] next unto King Ahasuerus and great among the Jews and accepted of the multitude of his brethren, seeking the good of his people and speaking peace unto all his seed.

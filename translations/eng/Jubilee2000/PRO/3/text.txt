My son, forget not my law, but let thine heart keep my commandments:
For they shall add length of days and long life and peace unto thee.
Let not mercy and truth forsake thee; bind them about thy neck; write them upon the tablet of thine heart:
So shalt thou find grace and good favour in the sight of God and man.
Trust in the LORD with all thine heart and lean not unto thine own understanding.
In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy paths.
Be not wise in thine own eyes; fear the LORD and depart from evil.
It shall be medicine to thy navel and marrow to thy bones.
Honour the LORD with thy substance and with the firstfruits of all thine increase:
So shall thy barns be filled with plenty, and thy presses shall burst out with new wine.
My son, do not despise the chastening of the LORD; neither be weary of his correction:
For the LORD chastens whom he loves and delights in, even as a father to his son.
Blessed [is] the man [that] has found wisdom and who brings [to light] intelligence,
for the merchandise of it [is] better than the merchandise of silver and the fruits thereof more than fine gold.
She [is] more precious than precious stones, and all the things thou canst desire are not to be compared unto her.
Length of days [is] in her right hand [and] in her left hand riches and honour.
Her ways [are] ways of pleasantness, and all her paths [are] peace.
She [is a] tree of life to those that lay hold upon her, and blessed [is every one] that retains her.
The LORD by wisdom has founded the earth; by intelligence has he established the heavens.
By his knowledge the depths are broken up, and the heavens drop down the dew.
My son, do not let them depart from thine eyes; keep sound wisdom and discretion,
so shall they be life unto thy soul and grace to thy neck.
Then shalt thou walk in thy way safely, and thy foot shall not stumble.
When thou liest down, thou shalt not be afraid: [yea], thou shalt lie down, and thy sleep shall be sweet.
Thou shall not be afraid of sudden fear, neither of the desolation of the wicked when it comes.
For the LORD shall be thy confidence and shall keep thy foot from being taken.
Do not withhold good from those to whom it is due, when it is in the power of thine hand to do [it].
Do not say unto thy neighbour, Go and come again and tomorrow I will give when thou hast it by thee.
Do not devise evil against thy neighbour, seeing he dwells securely by thee.
Do not sue a man without cause, if he has done thee no harm.
Envy thou not the oppressor and choose none of his ways.
For the perverse [is an] abomination to the LORD; but his secret [is] with the righteous.
The curse of the LORD [is] in the house of the wicked, but he shall bless the habitation of the just.
Surely he scorns the scorners; but he gives grace unto the humble.
The wise shall inherit glory; but shame shall be the promotion of fools.:

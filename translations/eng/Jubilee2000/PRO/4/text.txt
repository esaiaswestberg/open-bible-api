Hearken, ye sons, [unto] the chastening of the father, and pay attention that ye might know understanding.
For I give you good doctrine; do not forsake my law.
For I was my father's son, tender and unique in the sight of my mother.
He taught me and said unto me, Sustain thine heart with my words; keep my commandments, and live.
Get wisdom, get understanding; forget [it] not; neither decline from the words of my mouth.
Forsake her not, and she shall preserve thee; love her, and she shall keep thee.
Wisdom [is] the principal thing, [therefore] get wisdom: and with all thy getting get understanding.
Grow in [wisdom], and she shall promote thee; she shall bring thee to honour when thou hast embraced her.
She shall give to thine head an increase of grace; a crown of glory shall she deliver to thee.
Hear, O my son, and receive my words, and the years of thy life shall be multiplied.
I have taught thee in the way of wisdom; I have caused thee to walk in right paths.
When thou goest [in these paths], thy steps shall not be hindered; and when thou runnest, thou shalt not stumble.
Take fast hold of chastening; do not let go; keep this; for it [is] thy life.
Enter not into the path of the wicked, and go not in the way of evil [men].
Avoid it, pass not by it, turn from it, and pass away.
For they do not sleep, unless they have done evil; and their sleep is taken away, unless they cause [someone] to fall.
For they eat the bread of wickedness, and drink the wine of violence.
But the path of the just [is] as the light of the [morning] star, that shines more and more until the day is perfect.
The way of the wicked [is] as darkness; they do not know in what they stumble.
My son, attend to my words; incline thine ear unto my words.
Let them not depart from thine eyes; keep them in the midst of thine heart.
For they [are] life unto those that find them and medicine to all their flesh.
Above all else, guard thy heart; for out of it flows the [issues of] life.
Put away from thee the perversion of the mouth, and the deviation of the lips put far from thee.
Let thine eyes look upon that which is right, and let thine eyelids straighten [thy path] before thee.
Ponder the path of thy feet, and let all thy ways be established.
Turn not to the right hand nor to the left; remove thy foot from evil.:

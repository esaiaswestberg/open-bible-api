My son, if thou be surety for thy friend, [if] thou hast stricken thy hand with a stranger,
thou art snared with the words of thy mouth; thou art taken with the words of thy mouth.
Do this now, my son, and deliver thyself, for thou hast fallen into the hand of thy friend; go, humble thyself, and make sure thy friend.
Give not sleep to thine eyes, nor slumber to thine eyelids.
Escape as a roe from the hand [of the hunter] and as a bird from the hand of the fowler.
Go to the ant, thou sluggard; consider her ways, and be wise,
Who having no guide, overseer, or ruler,
provides her food in the summer [and] gathers her food in the harvest.
How long wilt thou sleep, O sluggard? when wilt thou arise out of thy sleep?
[Yet] a little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to sleep:
So shall thy poverty come as one that travels and thy want as an armed man.
A wicked man of Belial walks with a perverse mouth.
He winks with his eyes, he speaks with his feet, he teaches with his fingers;
there is perversion in his heart; he devises evil continually; he sows discord.
Therefore his calamity shall come suddenly; suddenly he shall be broken without remedy.
These six [things] does the LORD hate: [yea], seven [are] an abomination unto him:
A proud look, a lying tongue, and hands that shed innocent blood,
a heart that devises wicked imaginations, feet that are swift in running to evil,
a false witness [that] speaks lies, and he that sows discord among brethren.
My son, keep thy father's commandment and forsake not the law of thy mother:
Bind them continually upon thine heart [and] tie them about thy neck.
When thou goest, it shall lead thee; when thou sleepest, it shall keep thee; and [when] thou awakest, it shall talk with thee.
For the commandment [is] fire, and the law [is] light; and reproofs of chastening [are] the way of life,
to keep thee from the evil woman, from the flattery of the tongue of a strange woman.
Lust not after her beauty in thine heart, neither let her take thee with her eyes.
For by means of a whorish woman [a man is reduced] to a piece of bread, and the woman will hunt the precious soul of the man.
Can a man take fire in his bosom and his clothes not be burned?
Can one go upon hot coals, and his feet not be burned?
So [is] he that goes in to his neighbour's wife; whosoever touches her shall not be innocent.
[Men] do not take a thief lightly, [even] if he steals to satisfy his soul when he is hungry;
and once he is taken, he shall restore sevenfold; he shall give all the substance of his house.
[But] whosoever commits adultery with a woman [has a] fault in [his] heart; he [that] does it corrupts his own soul.
A wound and dishonour shall he get, and his reproach shall never be wiped away.
For the jealous rage of a man will not spare in the day of vengeance.
He will not regard any ransom; neither will he want to forgive, though thou givest many bribes.:

That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked upon, and our hands have handled, of the Word of life
(for the life is manifested, and we also saw [it] and bear witness and show unto you that eternal life, which was with the Father and appeared unto us);
that which we have seen and heard we declare unto you, that ye also may have communion with us; and truly our communion [is] with the Father and with his Son Jesus Christ.
And these things write we unto you, that your joy may be fulfilled.
This then is the promise which we have heard of him and declare unto you, That God is light, and in him is no darkness at all.
If we say that we have fellowship with him and walk in darkness, we lie, and do not the truth;
But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have communion with him in the midst of us, and the blood of Jesus Christ, his Son cleanses us from all sin.
If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and there is no truth in us.
If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us [our] sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.
If we say that we have not sinned, we make him a liar, and his word is not in us.:

For thou hadst cast me into the deep, in the midst of the seas; and the floods compassed me about; all thy billows and thy waves passed over me.
Then I said, I am cast out of thy sight; yet I will see thy holy temple again.
The waters compassed me about, [even] to the soul, the depth closed me round about; the weeds were wrapped about my head.
I descended to the roots of the mountains; the earth [put] her bars about me for ever; yet thou hast brought up my life out of the grave, O LORD my God.
When my soul fainted within me, I remembered the LORD, and my prayer entered in unto thee in thy holy temple.
Those that observe lying vanities forsake his mercy.
But I will sacrifice unto thee with the voice of thanksgiving; I will pay [that] which I have vowed; that saving comes of the LORD.
And the LORD spoke unto the fish, and it vomited out Jonah upon the dry [land].:

The elders who are among you I exhort (I am also an elder with them and a witness of the afflictions of the Christ, and also a participant of the glory that shall be revealed).
Feed the flock of God which is among you, caring for her, not by force, but willingly; not for shameful lucre, but with willing desire;
and not as having lordship over the heritage of the Lord, but in such a manner as to be examples of the flock.
And when the great Prince of the pastors shall appear, ye shall receive the incorruptible crown of glory.
Likewise, young people, be subject to the elders in such a manner that you are all subject to one another. Be clothed with humility of will, for God resists the proud and gives grace to the humble.
Humble yourselves, therefore, under the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt you in due time,
casting all your cares upon him, for he cares for you.
Be temperate and vigilant because your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walks about, seeking whom he may devour,
resist him steadfast in the faith, knowing that the same afflictions are to be accomplished in the company of your brethren that are in the world.
But the God of all grace, who has called us unto his eternal glory by Jesus, the Christ, after ye have suffered a little while, he himself perfects, confirms, strengthens, and establishes [you].
To him [be] glory and dominion for ever and ever. Amen.
By Silvanus, a faithful brother; (according to my reckoning) I have written briefly, exhorting, and testifying that this is the true grace of God in which ye stand.
The [church that is] at Babylon, chosen together with [you], salutes you and [so does] Mark, my son.
Greet one another with a kiss of charity. Peace [be] with you all that are in Jesus, the Christ. Amen.:

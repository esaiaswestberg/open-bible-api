I [am] the lily of the field [[Heb. Sharon]] [and] the rose of the valleys.
As the lily among thorns, so [is] my love among the virgins.
As the apple tree among the trees of the wild, so [is] my beloved among the sons. [I] desired to [sit] under his shadow, and his fruit [was] sweet to my taste.
He brought me to the wine chamber and placed his banner of love over me.
Sustain me with flagons [of wine], strengthen me with apples; for I [am] sick with love.
His left hand [is] under my head, and his right hand embraces me.
I charge you, O ye virgins of Jerusalem, by the roes and by the hinds of the field that ye not awake nor stir up love, until he pleases.
The voice of my beloved! behold, he comes leaping over the mountains, skipping over the hills.
My beloved is like a roe or a young hart; behold, he stands behind our wall; he looks through the windows, blossoming through the lattice.
My beloved spoke and said unto me, Rise up, my love, my fair one, and come away.
For, behold, the winter is past; the rain is over [and] gone;
the flowers appear on the earth; the time of the song is come, and the voice of the turtle [dove] has been heard in our land;
the fig tree has put forth her [green] figs, and the vines in blossom have given forth [their] fragrance. Arise, my love, my fair one, and come away.
O my dove, [that art] in the clefts of the rock, in the secret [places] of the stairs, let me see thy countenance, let me hear thy voice; for sweet [is] thy voice, and thy countenance [is] beautiful.
Hunt the foxes [for] us, the little foxes, that spoil the vines; for our vines [are] in blossom.
My beloved [is] mine, and I [am] his; he feeds among the lilies.
Until the day breaks and the shadows flee away, return, my beloved, and be thou like a roe or a young hart upon the mountains of Bether.:

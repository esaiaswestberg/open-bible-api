How beautiful are thy feet in [thy] shoes, O prince's daughter! the joints of thy thighs [are] like jewels, the work of the hands of an [excellent] workman.
Thy navel [is like] a round goblet, [which] does not lack liquor; thy belly [is like] a heap of wheat set about with lilies.
Thy two breasts [are] like two young roes [that are] twins.
Thy neck [is] as a tower of ivory; thine eyes [like] the fishpools in Heshbon by the gate of Bathrabbim; thy nose [is] as the tower of Lebanon which looks toward Damascus.
Thine head upon thee [is] like scarlet, and the hair of thine head like the purple of the king hung in the galleries.
How fair and how pleasant art thou, O love, for delights!
This, thy stature is like unto the palm tree, and thy breasts to the clusters.
I said, I will climb up the palm tree, I will take hold of the clusters thereof; now also thy breasts shall be as clusters of the vine and the smell of thy nose like apples;
and thy palate like the best wine that goes into my beloved sweetly and causes the lips of those that are asleep to speak.
I [am] my beloved's, and with me he has his contentment.
Come, my beloved, let us go forth into the field; let us lodge in the villages.
Let us get up early to the vineyards; let us see if the vines flourish, [whether] the tender flowers appear, if the pomegranates bud forth; there I will give thee my loves.
The mandrakes have given their fragrance, and at our gates [are] all manner of sweet [fruits], new and old, [which] I have laid up for thee, O my beloved.:

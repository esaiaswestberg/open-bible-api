So all the generations from Abraham to David [are] fourteen generations; from David until the carrying away into Babylon [are] fourteen generations; from the carrying away into Babylon unto the Christ [are] fourteen generations.
Now the birth of Jesus Christ was like this: That being, his mother Mary espoused to Joseph (before they came together) she was found with child of the Holy Spirit.
Then Joseph her husband, being just and not willing to expose her publicly, desired to leave her secretly.
But while he thought on these things, behold, the angel of the Lord appeared unto him in dreams, saying, Joseph, thou son of David, fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife; for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Spirit.
And she shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call his name Jesus, for he shall save his people from their sins.
Now all this was done that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the Lord through the prophet, saying,
Behold, a virgin shall conceive and shall bring forth a son, and they shall call his name Emmanuel, which being interpreted is God With Us.
Then Joseph, being aroused from sleep, did as the angel of the Lord had bidden him and took unto him his wife
and knew her not until she had brought forth her firstborn son, and he called his name Jesus.:

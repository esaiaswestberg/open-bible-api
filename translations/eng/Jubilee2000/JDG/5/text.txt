Then sang Deborah with Barak, the son of Abinoam, on that day, saying,
Praise ye the LORD for the avenging of Israel, when the people willingly offered themselves.
Hear, O ye kings. Give ear, O ye princes; I, [even] I, will sing unto the LORD; I will praise the LORD God of Israel.
LORD, when thou didst go out of Seir, when thou didst march out of the field of Edom, the earth trembled, and the heavens dropped; the clouds also dropped water.
The mountains melted from before the LORD, [even] that Sinai from before the LORD God of Israel.
In the days of Shamgar, the son of Anath, in the days of Jael, the highways ceased, and those that walked went [astray] through crooked paths.
[The inhabitants of] the villages ceased; they had ceased in Israel until I Deborah arose, I arose a mother in Israel.
When they chose new gods, the war [was] at the gates. Was there a shield or spear to be seen among forty thousand in Israel?
My heart [is] toward the princes of Israel, those that offered themselves willingly among the people. Bless ye the LORD.
Speak, ye that ride on white asses, ye that preside in judgment, and walk by the way.
Because of the noise of archers, [taken from] among those that draw water, there they shall retell the righteousnesses of the LORD, [even] the righteousnesses of his villages in Israel. Now shall the people of the LORD go down to the gates.
Rise up, rise up, Deborah; rise up, rise up, sing a song. Stand up, Barak and lead thy captivity captive, thou son of Abinoam.
Now he has made the remnant of the people to have dominion over the magnificent; the LORD made me have dominion over the mighty.
Out of Ephraim came his root against Amalek; after thee, [came] Benjamin, against thy peoples; out of Machir came down princes; and from Zebulun, those that handle the pen of the writer.
Also princes of Issachar [were] with Deborah; and Issachar, like Barak, went on foot into the valley. From the divisions of Reuben, great are the thoughts of the heart.
Why didst thou abide among the sheepfolds, to hear the bleatings of the flocks? From the divisions of Reuben great are the searchings of the heart.
Gilead remained on the other side of the Jordan, and why did Dan remain next to the ships? Asher continued on the sea shore and remained in his breaches.
Zebulun and Naphtali [were] a people [that] jeoparded their lives unto the death in the high places of the field.
The kings came [and] fought; then the kings of Canaan fought in Taanach by the waters of Megiddo; they took no gain of money.
They fought from the heavens; the stars from their ways fought against Sisera.
The river of Kishon swept them away, that ancient river, the river Kishon. Tred down, O my soul, with strength.
Then were the hoofs of the horses broken by the means of the pransings, the pransings of their mighty ones.
Curse ye Meroz, said the angel of the LORD, curse ye bitterly the inhabitants thereof because they did not come to the help of the LORD, to the help of the LORD against the mighty.
Blessed above women shall Jael, the wife of Heber the Kenite, be; blessed shall she be above women in the tent.
He asked water, [and] she gave [him] milk; she brought forth cream in a lordly dish.
She put her hand to the stake, and her right hand to the workmen's hammer, and with the hammer she smote Sisera, she smote off his head when she had pierced and stricken through his temples.
At her feet he bowed, he fell, he lay down; at her feet he bowed, he fell; where he bowed, there he fell down dead.
The mother of Sisera looked out the window and cried through the lattice, Why is his chariot [so] long in coming? Why do the wheels of his chariots tarry?
Her wise princesses answered her; and she even answered to herself,
Have they not found spoil and are dividing it? To each man a damsel [or] two; to Sisera a spoil of different colours, a spoil of different colours of needlework, of different colours of needlework on both sides, [meet] for the necks of [those that take] the spoil?
So let all thine enemies perish, O LORD, but [let] those that love thee [be] as the sun when he rises in all his might. And the land had rest forty years.:

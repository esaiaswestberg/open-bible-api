Behold my servant, whom I uphold; my elect, [in whom] my soul delights; I have put my Spirit upon him; he shall give judgment unto the Gentiles.
He shall not cry, nor lift up, nor cause his voice to be heard in the streets.
He shall not break a bruised reed, nor shall he quench the smoking flax; he shall bring forth judgment unto truth.
He shall not tire nor faint until he has set judgment in the earth; and the isles shall wait for his law.
Thus saith God the LORD, the Creator of the heavens and he that stretches them out; he that spreads forth the earth and that which comes out of it; he that gives breath unto the people upon it and spirit to those that walk therein:
I the LORD have called thee in righteousness and will hold thee by thine hand; I will keep thee and place thee as [my] covenant unto the people as light unto [the] Gentiles
that thou might open [the] eyes of [the] blind, that thou might bring out the prisoners from the prison [and] those that sit in darkness out of the prison house.
I [am] the LORD. This [is] my name, and my glory I will not give to another, neither my praise to graven images.
Behold, the former things are come to pass, and I declare new things: before they spring forth I tell you of them.
Sing unto the LORD a new song [and] his praise from the end of the earth, ye that go down to the sea and all that is therein, the isles, and the inhabitants thereof.
Let the wilderness and the cities thereof lift up [their voice], the villages [that] Kedar inhabits; let the inhabitants of the rock sing, let them shout from the top of the mountains.
Let them give glory unto the LORD and declare his praise in the islands.
The LORD shall go forth as a giant; he shall stir up jealousy like a man of war; he shall cry [out] a battle cry; he shall prevail against his enemies.
I have long time held my peace; I have been still [and] refrained myself; [now] will I cry [out] like a travailing woman; I will destroy and devour at once.
I will make waste mountains and hills and dry up all their grass, and I will make the rivers islands, and I will dry up the pools.
And I will bring the blind by a way [that] they knew not; I will cause them to walk in paths [that] they have not known; I will make darkness light before them and crooked things straight. These things will I do unto them and not forsake them.
They shall be turned back; they shall be greatly ashamed, that trust in graven images, that say to the molten images, Ye [are] our gods.
Hear, ye deaf; and look, ye blind, that ye may see.
Who [is] blind, but my servant? or deaf, as my messenger [that] I sent? Who [is] blind as [he that is] perfect, and blind as the servant of the LORD,
who sees many things and does not warn; who opens his ears and does not hear.
The LORD, jealous for his righteousness, will magnify the law and enlarge [it].
Therefore this people [is] robbed and spoiled; all of them shall be snared in holes and hid in prison houses; they shall be for a prey, and no one delivers; for a spoil, and no one saith, Restore.
Who among you will give ear to this? [Who] will warn and consider regarding the time to come?
Who gave Jacob for a spoil and Israel to the robbers? Did not the LORD? Because we sinned against him, and they did not desire to walk in his ways, neither did they hearken unto his law.
Therefore he has poured upon him the fury of his anger and the strength of battle; he put fire round about him, yet he was careless; and it set him on fire, yet he did not lay [it] to heart.:

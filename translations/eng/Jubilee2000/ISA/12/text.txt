And in that day thou shalt say, O LORD, I will sing unto thee; though thou wast angry with me, thine anger is turned away, and thou hast comforted me.
Behold, O God my saving health, I will trust and not be afraid for JAH, the LORD, [is] my strength and [my] song; he also is become saving health unto me.
Therefore with joy shall ye draw water out of the wells of saving health.
And in that day ye shall say, Sing unto the LORD, call upon his name, declare his doings among the peoples, remember how his name is exalted.
Sing psalms unto the LORD; for he has done excellent things; [let] this [be] known in all the earth.
Rejoice and sing, thou inhabitant of Zion: for great [is] the Holy One of Israel in the midst of thee.:

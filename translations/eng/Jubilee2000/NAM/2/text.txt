The destroyer is risen up against thee: keep the fortress, watch the way, make [thy] loins strong, fortify [thy] power mightily.
For the LORD shall restore the glory of Jacob as the glory of Israel; for the emptiers have emptied them out and marred their vine branches.
The shield of his valiant ones shall be red, the men of [his] army [are] in scarlet, the chariot [as] fire of torches [in] the day which shall be made ready; the fir trees shall be terribly shaken.
The chariots shall rage in the streets; they shall flow through the streets, their faces like torches; they shall run like the lightnings.

And the LORD spoke unto Moses, saying,
Speak unto the sons of Israel and say unto them, I AM your God.
You shall not do as they do in the land of Egypt, in which ye dwelt; nor shall you do as they do in the land of Canaan, where I bring you; neither shall ye walk in their statutes.
Ye shall comply with my rights and keep my statutes, walking in them. I AM your God.
Therefore you shall keep my rights and my statutes, of which the man doing them, shall live in them. I [am] the LORD.
No man shall approach any [woman] that is near of kin to him, to uncover her nakedness. I [am] the LORD.
The nakedness of thy father or the nakedness of thy mother, thou shalt not uncover; she [is] thy mother; thou shalt not uncover her nakedness.
The nakedness of thy father's wife thou shalt not uncover; it [is thy father's nakedness.
The nakedness of thy sister, the daughter of thy father or daughter of thy mother, [whether she is] born at home or born abroad, their nakedness thou shalt not uncover.
The nakedness of thy son's daughter or of thy daughter's daughter, their nakedness thou shalt not uncover; for theirs is thine own nakedness.
The nakedness of thy father's wife's daughter, begotten of thy father, she [is] thy sister, thou shalt not uncover her nakedness.
Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy father's sister; she [is] thy father's near kinswoman.
Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy mother's sister; for she [is] thy mother's near kinswoman.
Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy father's brother, thou shalt not approach to his wife; she [is] thine aunt.
Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy daughter-in-law; she [is] thy son's wife; thou shalt not uncover her nakedness.
Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy brother's wife; it [is] thy brother's nakedness.
Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of a woman and her daughter; neither shalt thou take her son's daughter or her daughter's daughter to uncover her nakedness; [for] they are her near kinswomen; it [is] wickedness.
Neither shalt thou take a woman together with her sister, to make her a rival, to uncover her nakedness, beside the other in her lifetime.
Also thou shalt not approach unto a woman to uncover her nakedness as long as she is separated for her uncleanness.
Moreover thou shalt not lie carnally with thy neighbour's wife, contaminating thyself with her.
And thou shalt not let any of thy seed pass through [the fire] to Molech; neither shalt thou contaminate the name of thy God: I [am] the LORD.
Thou shalt not lie with males as with women; it [is] abomination.
Neither shalt thou lie with any beast to defile thyself therewith; neither shall any woman stand before a beast to join herself with it; it [is] mixture.
Do not defile yourselves in any of these things; for in all these things the Gentiles which I cast out before you have defiled themselves;
and the land became defiled; therefore, I visited its iniquity upon it, and the land itself vomited out her inhabitants.
Ye shall, therefore, keep my statutes and my rights and shall not commit [any] of these abominations, [neither] the natural of your own nor any stranger that sojourns among you.
(For all these abominations were done by the men of the land who [were] before you, and the land was contaminated.)
And will the land not vomit you out also for having contaminated it, as it vomited out the Gentiles that were before you?
For whoever shall commit any of these abominations, the persons that commit [them] shall be cut off from among his people.
Keep, therefore, my ordinance that [ye] commit not [any one] of these abominable laws which were committed before you, and do not defile yourselves in them; I [am] the LORD your God.:

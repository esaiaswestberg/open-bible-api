And the LORD spoke unto Moses, saying,
Speak unto the sons of Israel and say unto them, When someone shall make a special vow unto the LORD, according to the estimation of the the persons [that are to be redeemed], thus shall be thy estimation:
Regarding the male from twenty years old even unto sixty years old, thy estimation shall be fifty shekels of silver, according to the shekel of the sanctuary.
And if it [is] a female, then thy estimation shall be thirty shekels.
And if [it is] from five years old even unto twenty years old, then thy estimation shall be of the male twenty shekels, and for the female ten shekels.
And if [it is] from a month old even unto five years old, then thy estimation shall be of the male five shekels of silver, and for the female thy estimation [shall be] three shekels of silver.
And if [it is] from sixty years old and above, if [it is] a male, then thy estimation shall be fifteen shekels, and for the female ten shekels.
But if he is poorer than thy estimation, then he shall present himself before the priest, and the priest shall value him; according to the ability of the one that vowed shall the priest value him.
And if [it is] an animal which is offered unto the LORD, all that [anyone] gives of such unto the LORD shall be holy.
He shall not alter it nor change it, a good for a bad, or a bad for a good; and if he shall exchange one animal for another, then it and the one exchanged thereof shall belong to the sanctuary.
And if it [is] an unclean animal, which cannot be offered as a sacrifice unto the LORD, then he shall present the animal before the priest;
and the priest shall value it, whether it is good or bad; according to the estimation of the priest, so shall it be.
But if it must be redeemed, then they shall add a fifth [part] thereof unto thy estimation.
And when a man shall sanctify his house [to be] holy unto the LORD, then the priest shall value it, whether it is good or bad; as the priest shall value it, so shall it stand.
And if he that sanctified it will redeem his house, then he shall add the fifth [part] of the money of thy estimation unto it, and it shall be his.
And if a man shall sanctify unto the LORD [some part] of a field of his possession, then thy estimation shall be according to the seed thereof; one homer of barley seed [shall be valued] at fifty shekels of silver.
If he sanctifies his field from the year of jubilee, according to thy estimation it shall stand.
But if he sanctifies his field after the jubilee, then the priest shall reckon unto him the money according to the years that remain until the year of the jubilee, and it shall be abated from thy estimation.
And if he that sanctified the field desires to redeem it, then he shall add the fifth [part]of the money of thy estimation unto it, and it shall be assured to him.
But if he should not redeem the field, and if the field is sold to another, it shall not be redeemed any more;
but the field, when it goes out in the jubilee, shall be holy unto the LORD, as a field of anathema; the possession thereof shall be the priest's.
And if [anyone] sanctifies unto the LORD a field which he has bought, which is not of the fields of his inheritance,
then the priest shall reckon unto him the worth of thy estimation until the year of the jubilee; and that day he shall give thy assigned price, [as] a holy [thing] unto the LORD.
In the year of the jubilee the field shall return unto the one of whom it was bought, unto whom the inheritance of the land [did belong].
And all thy values shall be according to the shekel of the sanctuary; twenty gerahs shall be the shekel.
But the firstborn of the animals, which because it is firstborn belongs to the LORD, no one shall sanctify it; whether [it is] ox or sheep, it [is] the LORD'S.
And if [it is] of an unclean beast, it shall be ransomed according to thy estimation, and they shall add a fifth [part] unto it; or if it is not redeemed, then it shall be sold according to thy estimation.
But no anathema, that anyone shall devote unto the LORD of all that they have of men and animals and of the fields of his possession, shall be sold or redeemed. All anathema [is] most holy unto the LORD.
Any anathema of men which is devoted shall not be ransomed, [but] shall surely be put to death.
And all the tithes of the land, [whether] of the seed of the land or of the fruit of the tree, is the LORD'S; [it is] holiness unto the LORD.
And if anyone desires to redeem [anything] of his tithes, he shall add thereto the fifth [part] thereof.
And concerning the tithe of the cows or of the sheep, [even] of whatever passes under the rod, the tenth shall be holiness unto the LORD.
He shall not search whether it is good or bad, neither shall he change it; and if he changes it at all, then both it and the change thereof shall be holy; it shall not be redeemed.
These [are] the commandments, which the LORD commanded Moses for the sons of Israel in Mount Sinai.:

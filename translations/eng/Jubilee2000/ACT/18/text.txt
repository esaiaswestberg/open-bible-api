After these things Paul departed from Athens and came to Corinth
and found a certain Jew named Aquila, born in Pontus, lately come from Italy, with his wife Priscilla (for Claudius had commanded all Jews to depart from Rome) and came unto them.
And because he was of the same craft, he abode with them and worked, for by their occupation they were tentmakers.
And he reasoned in the synagogue every sabbath and persuaded Jews and Greeks.
And when Silas and Timothy were come from Macedonia, Paul was impressed by the Spirit and testified to the Jews [that] Jesus [was] the Christ.
And when they opposed themselves and blasphemed, he shook [his] raiment and said unto them, Your blood [be] upon your own heads; I [am] clean; from now on I will go unto the Gentiles.
And he departed from there and entered into a certain [man's] house, named Titus the Just, [one] that feared God, whose house was next to the synagogue.
And Crispus, the chief ruler of the synagogue, believed on the Lord with all his house; and many of the Corinthians, hearing, believed and were baptized.
Then the Lord spoke to Paul in the night by a vision, Do not be afraid, but speak and do not be silent,
For I am with thee, and no one shall be able to hurt thee, for I have many people in this city.
And he continued [there] a year and six months, teaching them the word of God.
And when Gallio was the proconsul of Achaia, the Jews rose up with one accord against Paul and brought him to the judgement seat,
saying, This [fellow] persuades men to honor God contrary to the law.
And when Paul was now about to open [his] mouth, Gallio said unto the Jews, If it were a matter of wrong or wicked lewdness, O [ye] Jews, reason would that I should bear with you;
but if it is a question of words and names and of your law, look ye [to it], for I will be no judge of such [matters].
And he drove them from the judgement seat.
Then all the Greeks took Sosthenes, the chief ruler of the synagogue, and beat [him] before the judgement seat. And Gallio cared for none of those things.
And Paul [after this] tarried [there] yet a good while and then took his leave of the brethren and sailed from there into Syria and with him Priscilla and Aquila, having shorn [his] head in Cenchrea, for he had a vow.
And he came to Ephesus and left them there, but he himself entered into the synagogue and reasoned with the Jews.
When they desired [him] to tarry longer time with them, he consented not,
but bade them farewell, saying, I must by all means keep this feast that comes in Jerusalem, but I will return again unto you, if God wills. And he sailed from Ephesus.
And when he had landed at Caesarea and gone up [to Jerusalem] and after greeting the church, he went down to Antioch.
And after he had spent some time [there], he departed and went over [all] the country of Galatia and Phrygia in order, confirming all the disciples.
And a certain Jew named Apollos, born at Alexandria, an eloquent man [and] mighty in the scriptures, came to Ephesus.
This man was instructed in the way of the Lord; and being fervent in the spirit, he spoke and taught diligently the things of the Lord, teaching only in the baptism of John.
And he began to speak boldly in the synagogue, but when Aquila and Priscilla had heard him, they took him unto [them] and expounded unto him the way of God more perfectly.
And when he was disposed to pass into Achaia, the exhorted brethren wrote the disciples to receive him, who, when he was come, was very helpful through grace unto those who had believed;
for he mightily convinced the Jews in public, showing by the scriptures that Jesus was the Christ.:

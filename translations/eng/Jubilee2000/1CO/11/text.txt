Be ye imitators of me, even as I also [am] of Christ.
Now I praise you, brothers, that ye remember me in all things and retain my instructions the same as I spoke unto you.
But I would have you know that the head of every man is the Christ, and the head of the woman [is] the man, and the head of Christ [is] God.
Every man praying or prophesying, having [his] head covered, dishonours his head.
But every woman that prays or prophesies with [her] head uncovered dishonours her head, for that is even the same as if she were shaven.
For if the woman is not covered, let her also be shorn; but if it is a shame for a woman to be shorn or shaven, let her be covered.
For a man indeed ought not to cover [his] head, forasmuch as he is the image and glory of God; but the woman is the glory of the man.
For the man is not of the woman, but the woman of the man.
Neither was the man created for the woman, but the woman for the man.
For this cause the woman ought to have authority over her head: because of the angels.
Nevertheless, neither is the man without the woman, neither the woman without the man, in the Lord.
For as the woman [is] of the man, even so [is] the man also by the woman; but all things of God.
Judge in yourselves: is it honest that a woman pray unto God uncovered?
Does not even nature itself teach you that if a man lets [his] hair grow, it is dishonest?
But if a woman lets [her] hair grow, it is a glory to her; for [her] hair is given her for a covering.
With all this, if anyone seems to be contentious, we have no such custom, neither the church of God.
Now in this that I declare [unto you] I praise [you] not: that ye come together not for the better, but for the worse.
For first of all, when ye come together in the church, I hear that there are divisions among you; and I partly believe it.
For it is expedient that there also be heresies among you, so that those who are proved may become manifest among you.
So that when ye come together in one [place, this] is not eating the Lord's supper.
For in eating, each one takes his own supper first: and one is hungry, and another is drunken.
What? Do ye not have houses to eat and to drink in? or do ye despise the church of God and shame those that have not? What shall I say to you? shall I praise you in this? I praise [you] not.
For I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you, That the Lord Jesus the [same] night in which he was betrayed took bread;
and when he had given thanks, he broke [it] and said, Take, eat: this is my body, which is broken for you; this do in remembrance of me.
After the same manner also [he took] the cup, after he had eaten supper, saying, This cup is the new testament in my blood; do this each time that ye drink, in remembrance of me.
For each time that ye eat this bread and drink this cup, ye declare the Lord's death until he comes.
Therefore whoever shall eat this bread and drink [this] cup of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord.
But let each man prove himself, and so let him eat of the bread and drink of the cup.
For he that eats and drinks unworthily, eats and drinks judgment to himself, not discerning the Lord's body.
For this cause many [are] weak and sickly among you, and many sleep.
For if we would examine ourselves, we should not be judged.
But being judged, we are chastened of the Lord, that we should not be condemned with the world.
Therefore, my brothers, when ye come together to eat, wait for one another.
And if anyone is hungry, let him eat at home; that ye not come together unto judgment. And I will set the rest in order when I come.:

<<To the Overcomer upon Nehiloth, A Psalm of David.>> Give ear to my words, O LORD; consider my meditation.
Hearken unto the voice of my cry, my King, and my God, for unto thee will I pray.
My voice shalt thou hear in the morning, O LORD; early [will I] present myself unto thee and wait.
For thou [art] not a God that loves wickedness; neither shall one who is evil dwell with thee.
The foolish [those who are governed by carnal thoughts or desires] shall not stand in thy sight; thou dost hate all workers of iniquity.
Thou shalt destroy those that speak lies: the LORD will abominate the bloody and deceitful man.
But as for me, I will come [into] thy house in the multitude of thy mercy: [and] in thy fear I will worship toward thy holy temple.
Lead me, O LORD, in thy righteousness because of mine enemies; make thy way straight before my face.
For [there is] no uprightness in their mouth; their inward part [is] very wickedness; their throat [is] an open sepulchre; they flatter with their tongue.
Declare them guilty, O God; let them fall by their own counsels; cast them out for the multitude of their rebellions; for they have rebelled against thee.
And all those that put their trust in thee shall rejoice: they shall ever be in jubilee, for thou shalt cover them; and all that love thy name shall be joyful in thee.
For thou, LORD, wilt bless the righteous; with favour wilt thou compass him as [with] a shield.:

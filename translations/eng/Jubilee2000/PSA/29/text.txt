<> Give unto the LORD, O ye mighty, give unto the LORD glory and strength.
Give unto the LORD the glory due unto his name; worship the LORD in the beauty of holiness.
The voice of the LORD [is] upon the waters: the God of glory thunders: the LORD [is] upon many waters.
The voice of the LORD [is] powerful; the voice of the LORD [is] full of majesty.
The voice of the LORD breaks the cedars; [yea], the LORD broke the cedars of Lebanon.
And He made them skip like a calves; Lebanon and Sirion like the sons of the unicorns.
The voice of the LORD divides the flames of fire.
The voice of the LORD [that] shall shake the wilderness; the LORD shall shake the wilderness of Kadesh.
The voice of the LORD shall make the hinds to calve and shall uncover the forests: and in his temple every one speaks to [his] glory.
The LORD sits upon the flood; [yea], the LORD sat down as King for ever.
The LORD will give strength unto his people; the LORD will bless his people in peace.:

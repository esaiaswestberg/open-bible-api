<<To the Overcomer on Neginoth, A Psalm [or] Song.>> God be merciful unto us and bless us [and] cause his face to shine upon us. Selah.
That thy way may be known upon the earth, thy saving health among all the Gentiles.
Let the peoples praise thee, O God; let all the peoples praise thee.
O let the Gentiles be glad and sing for joy, for thou shalt judge the people righteously and shepherd the Gentiles upon the earth. Selah.
Let the peoples praise thee, O God; let all the peoples praise thee.
[Then] shall the earth bring forth her fruit, [and] God, [even] our own God, shall bless us.
God shall bless us, and all the ends of the earth shall fear him.:

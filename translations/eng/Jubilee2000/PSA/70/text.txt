<<To the Overcomer, [A Psalm] of David, to bring to remembrance.>> [Make haste], O God, to deliver me; make haste to help me, O LORD.
Let them be ashamed and confounded that seek after my life; let them be turned backward and put to confusion that desire my hurt.
Let them be turned back for a reward of their shame that say, Aha, aha.
Let all those that seek thee rejoice and be glad in thee, and let such as love thy saving health say continually, Let God be magnified.
But I [am] poor and destitute; make haste unto me, O God: thou [art] my help and my deliverer; O LORD, make no tarrying.:

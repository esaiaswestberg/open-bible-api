<<To the Overcomer [upon], Do not destroy, Michtam of David; when Saul sent, and they watched the house to kill him.>> Deliver me from my enemies, O my God; defend me from those that rise up against me.
Deliver me from the workers of iniquity and save me from bloodthirsty men.
For, behold, they lie in wait for my soul; the strong are gathered against me; I [am] not in rebellion, nor [in] sin, O LORD.
They run and prepare themselves when [I] have committed no iniquity; awake to help me and behold.
Thou, therefore, O LORD God of the hosts, the God of Israel, awake to visit all the Gentiles; be not merciful to any rebellious [workers of] iniquity. Selah.
They will return at evening; they will bark like dogs and go round about [outside] the city.
Behold, they belch out with their mouth; swords [are] in their lips; for who, [say they], doth hear?
But thou, O LORD, shalt laugh at them; thou shalt have all the Gentiles in derision.
I will reserve his strength unto thee, for God [is] my defence.
The God of my mercy shall meet me [on the way]; God shall let me see [my desire] upon my enemies.
Slay them not lest my people forget; scatter them by thy power and bring them down, O Lord our shield.
[For] the sin of their mouth [and] the words of their lips, let them even be taken in their pride; they shall be subject to weakness and to a curse.
Consume [them] in wrath, consume [them] that they [may] not [be] and let them know that God rules in Jacob unto the ends of the earth. Selah.
And at evening let them return [and] let them bark like dogs and go round about [outside] the city.
Let them wander up and down for food and murmur if they are not satisfied.
But I will sing of thy power; I will sing aloud of thy mercy in the morning, for thou hast been my defence and refuge in the day of my trouble.
Unto thee, O my strength, will I sing, for God [is] my defence [and] the God of my mercy.:

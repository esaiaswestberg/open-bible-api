<<To the Overcomer, A [Psalm] of David.>> The fool has said in his heart, [There is] no God. They are corrupt, they have done abominable works, [there is] no one that does good.
The LORD looked down from heaven upon the children of men to see if there were any that did understand [and] seek God.
They are all gone aside, they are [all] together become filthy: [there is] no one that does good, no, not one.
The workers of iniquity certainly know [this]; those who eat up my people [as] they eat bread and do not call upon the LORD.
There they were in great fear: for God [is] with the nation of the righteous.
Ye have shamed the counsel of the poor because the LORD [is] his hope.
Oh that the saving health of Israel [were come] out of Zion! When the LORD turns back the captivity of his people, Jacob shall rejoice, [and] Israel shall be glad.:

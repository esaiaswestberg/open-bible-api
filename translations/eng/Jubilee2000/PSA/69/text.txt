<<To the Overcomer upon Shoshannim ([lilies]), [A Psalm] of David.>> Save me, O God; for the waters are come in unto [my] soul.
I sink in deep mire where [there is] no standing; I am come into deep waters, where the floods overflow me.
I am weary of my crying; my throat is dried; my eyes fail while I wait for my God.
Those that hate me without a cause are more than the hairs of my head; those that would destroy me, [being] my enemies wrongfully, are mighty; then I restored [that] which I did not take away.
O God, thou knowest my foolishness, and my guiltiness is not hid from thee.
Do not let those that wait on thee, O Lord GOD of the hosts, be ashamed for my sake; do not let those that seek thee be confounded for my sake, O God of Israel.
Because for thy sake I have borne reproach; shame has covered my face.
I am become a stranger unto my brethren and an alien unto my mother's sons.
For the zeal of thy house has consumed me, and the reproaches of those that reproached thee are fallen upon me.
When I wept with fasting of my soul, thou hast been a reproach unto me.
I made sackcloth also my garment, and I became a proverb to them.
They that sat in the gate spoke against me, and I [was] the song of the drunkards.
But I [corrected] my prayer unto thee, O LORD, [in] the time of [thy] good pleasure; O God, in the multitude of thy mercy hear me, in the truth of thy saving health.
Deliver me out of the mire, and let me not drown; let me be delivered from those that hate me and out of the deep waters.
Let not the violent force of the waters overcome me, neither let the deep swallow me up, and let not the pit shut her mouth upon me.
Hear me, O LORD, for thy mercy [is] perceptible, look upon me according to the multitude of thy acts of compassion
And hide not thy face from thy servant, for I am in trouble; hear me speedily.
Draw near unto my soul [and] redeem it; deliver me because of my enemies.
Thou hast known my reproach and my shame and my dishonour; my adversaries [are] all before thee.
Reproach has broken my heart, and I am full of heaviness, and I looked [for some] to take pity, but [there was] no one, and for comforters, but I found none.
They also gave me gall for my food; and in my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink.
Let their table become a snare before them, and [that which should have been] for [their] prosperity, [let it become] a stumbling block.
Let their eyes be darkened that they see not and make their loins continually to shake.
Pour out thine indignation upon them, and let thy wrathful anger take hold of them.
Let their palace be desolate, [and] let no one dwell in their tents.
For they persecute [him] whom thou hast smitten, and they boast that thou hast slain their enemies.
Add iniquity unto their iniquity, and let them not come into thy righteousness.
Let them be blotted out of the book of the living and not be written with the righteous.
But I [am] poor and sorrowful; let thy saving health, O God, set me up on high.
I will praise the name of God with a song and will magnify him with praises.
[This] also shall please the LORD better [than the sacrifice of an ox or] bullock that [struggles] with horns and hoofs.
The humble shall see [this] [and] be glad; seek God and thy heart shall live.
For the LORD hears the destitute and does not despise his prisoners.
Let the heavens and the earth praise him, the seas, and every thing that moves in them.
For God will protect Zion and will rebuild the cities of Judah; they shall dwell there and inherit it.
The seed of his servants shall inherit it, and those that love his name shall dwell therein.:

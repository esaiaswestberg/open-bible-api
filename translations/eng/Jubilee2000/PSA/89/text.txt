<<Maschil of Ethan the Ezrahite.>> I will sing of the mercies of the LORD for ever; with my mouth will I make known thy faithfulness to all generations.
For I have said, Mercy shall be built up for ever in the heavens; in them thou shalt establish thy truth.
I have made a covenant with my chosen; I have sworn unto David my servant, [saying],
Thy seed will I establish for ever and build up thy throne to all generations. Selah.
And the heavens shall praise thy wonder, O LORD, thy truth also in the congregation of the saints.
For who in the heavens can be compared unto the LORD? [who] among the sons of the mighty can be likened unto the LORD?
God is greatly to be feared in the assembly of the saints and to be had in reverence of all [those that are] about him.
O LORD God of the hosts, who [is] like unto thee? Strong JAH, compassed about with thy truth.
Thou dost rule the raging of the sea: when its waves arise, thou dost still them.
Thou hast broken Egypt in pieces as one that is slain; thou hast scattered thine enemies with thy strong arm.
The heavens [are] thine, the earth also [is] thine: the world and its fullness, thou didst found.
Thou hast created the north and the south; Tabor and Hermon shall sing in thy name.
The mighty arm is thine; strong is thy hand, [and] high is thy right hand.
Thy throne is composed of righteousness and judgment; mercy and truth go before thy face.
Happy [are] the people that know [how to] enter into joy; they shall walk, O LORD, in the light of thy countenance.
In thy name shall they rejoice each day; and in thy righteousness shall they be exalted.
For thou [art] the glory of their strength, and in thy favour our horn shall be exalted.
For the LORD [is] our shield, and the Holy One of Israel [is] our king.
Then thou didst speak in vision to thy holy one and didst say, I have laid help upon [one that is] mighty; I have exalted [one] chosen out of my people.
I have found David my servant; I anointed him with the oil of my holiness,
with whom my hand shall be established; mine arm also shall strengthen him.
The enemy shall not overcome him, nor the son of iniquity break him down.
But I will break down his foes before his face and smite those that hate him.
But my truth and my mercy [shall be] with him, and in my name shall his horn be exalted.
In the same manner I will set his hand also in the sea and his right hand in the rivers.
He shall call me, Thou [art] my father, my God, and the rock of my saving health.
Also I will make him [my] firstborn, high above the kings of the earth.
I will keep my mercy for him for ever, and my covenant shall stand fast with him.
I will also make his seed [to endure] for ever, and his throne as the days of the heavens.
If his sons forsake my law and do not walk in my judgments,
if they profane my statutes and do not keep my commandments,
then I will visit their rebellion with the rod and their iniquity with stripes.
Nevertheless I will not take my mercy from him, neither will I falsify my truth.
I will not profane my covenant, nor alter the thing that is gone out of my lips.
Once have I sworn by my holiness that I will not lie unto David.
His seed shall endure for ever and his throne as the sun before me.
It shall be established for ever as the moon and [as] a faithful witness in heaven. Selah.
But thou hast cast off and abhorred thine anointed; thou hast been wroth with [him].
Thou hast made void the covenant of thy servant; thou hast profaned his crown [by casting it] to the ground.
Thou hast broken down all his hedges; thou hast brought his strong holds to ruin.
All that pass by the way spoil him; he is a reproach to his neighbours.
Thou hast set up the right hand of his adversaries; thou hast made all his enemies to rejoice.
Thou hast also blunted the edge of his sword and hast not made him to stand in the battle.
Thou hast made his clarity to cease and cast his throne down to the ground.
The days of his youth hast thou shortened; thou hast covered him with shame. Selah.
How long, O LORD? wilt thou hide thyself for ever? shall thy wrath burn like fire?
Remember how short my time is; why hast thou made all men [subject] to vanity?
What man [is he that] lives and shall not see death? shall he deliver his soul from the hand of Sheol? Selah.
Lord, where [are] thy former mercies, [which] thou didst sware unto David in thy truth?
Remember, Lord, the reproach of thy servants; [how] I do bear in my bosom [the reproach of] many peoples,
because thine enemies have dishonoured, O LORD; they have dishonoured the footsteps of thine anointed.
Blessed [be] the LORD for ever. Amen and Amen. Part Four:

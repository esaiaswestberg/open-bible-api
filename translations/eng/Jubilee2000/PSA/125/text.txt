<> Those that trust in the LORD [are] as mount Zion, [which] cannot be removed [but] abides for ever.
As the mountains [are] round about Jerusalem, so the LORD [is] round about his people from now on even for ever.
For the rod of wickedness shall not rest upon the lot of the righteous because the righteous shall not put forth their hands unto iniquity.
Do good, O LORD, unto [those that are] good and [to those that are] upright in their hearts.
As for such as turn aside unto their crooked ways, the LORD shall take them away with the workers of iniquity; [and] peace [shall be] upon Israel.:

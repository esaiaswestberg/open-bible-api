<> When the LORD shall turn again the captivity of Zion, we shall be like those that dream.
Then our mouth shall be filled with laughter and our tongue with singing; then they shall say among the Gentiles, The LORD has done great things with them.
The LORD has done great things with us, [of which] we shall be glad.
Turn again our captivity, O LORD, as the streams in the south.
Those that sow with tears shall reap with joy.
He that goes forth and weeps, bearing the precious seed, shall doubtless come again with rejoicing, bringing his sheaves [with him].:

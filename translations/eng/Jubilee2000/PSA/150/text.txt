Halelu-JAH. Praise God in his sanctuary; praise him in the firmament of his power.
Praise him for his mighty acts; praise him according to his excellent greatness.
Praise him with the sound of the shofar; praise him with the psaltery and harp.
Praise him with the timbrel and dance; praise him with stringed instruments and organs.
Praise him upon the loud cymbals; praise him upon the cymbals of joy.
Let every thing that has breath praise JAH. Halelu-JAH.:

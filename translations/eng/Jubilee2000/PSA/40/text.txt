<<To the Overcomer, A Psalm of David.>> I waited patiently for the LORD, and he inclined unto me and heard my cry.
He brought me up also out of the pit of hopelessness, out of the miry clay and set my feet upon a rock [and] straightened my steps.
And he has put a new song in my mouth, [even] praise unto our God; many shall see [it] and fear and shall wait on the LORD.
Blessed [is] that man that makes the LORD his trust and does not respect the proud, nor such as turn aside to lies.
Thou hast increased, O LORD my God, thy wonderful works [which] thou hast done and thy thoughts regarding us; they are beyond our ability to express, declare, or speak; they cannot be told.
Sacrifice and offering thou didst not desire; mine ears hast thou opened; burnt offering and sin offering thou hast not required.
Then said I, Behold, I come; in the volume of the book [it is] written of me,
I delight to do thy will, O my God; thy law [is] within my bowels.
I have preached righteousness in the great congregation; behold, I have not refrained my lips, O LORD, thou knowest.
I have not hid thy righteousness within my heart; I have declared thy truth and thy salvation; I have not concealed thy mercy and thy truth from the great congregation.
Do not withhold thy tender mercies from me, O LORD; let thy mercy and thy truth continually preserve me.
For innumerable evils have compassed me about; my iniquities have taken hold upon me, so that I am not able to see; they are more than the hairs of my head; therefore my heart fails me.
Be pleased, O LORD, to deliver me; O LORD, make haste to help me.
Let them be ashamed and confounded together that seek after my life to destroy it; let them be driven backward and put to shame that wish me evil.
Let them be desolate for a reward of their shame that say unto me, Aha, aha.
Let all those that seek thee rejoice and be glad in thee; let such as love thy salvation say continually, The LORD be magnified.
When I [am] poor and needy; the Lord will remember me; thou [art] my help and my deliverer; make no tarrying, O my God.:

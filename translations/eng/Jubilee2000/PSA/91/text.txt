He that dwells in the secret place of the most High shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty.
I will say of the LORD, [He is] my hope and my fortress: my God; in him will I secure myself.
Surely he shall deliver thee from the snare of the fowler [and] from the mortal pestilence.
He shall cover thee with his feathers, and under his wings thou shalt be secure: his truth [shall be thy] shield and buckler.
Thou shalt not be afraid for the terror by night, [nor] for the arrow [that] flies by day,
[nor] for the pestilence [that] walks in darkness, [nor] for the destruction [that] wastes at noonday.
Thousands shall fall at thy side and ten thousands at thy right hand, [but] it shall not come near thee.
Surely with thine eyes thou shalt behold and see the reward of the wicked.
Because thou hast made the LORD, [who is] my hope, [even] the most High thy habitation,
no evil shall befall thee, neither shall any plague come near thy dwelling.
For he shall give his angels charge over thee to keep thee in all thy ways.
They shall bear thee up in [their] hands lest thy foot stumble against a stone.
Thou shalt tread upon the lion and adder; the young lion and the dragon shalt thou trample under feet.
Because he has set his will upon me, therefore I will deliver him; I will set him on high because he has known my name.
He shall call upon me, and I will answer him; I [will be] with him in trouble; I will deliver him and glorify him.
With long life I will satisfy him and show him my saving health.:

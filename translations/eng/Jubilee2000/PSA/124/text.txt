<> If the LORD had not been for us, now may Israel say,
If the LORD had not been for us, when men rose up against us,
then they would have swallowed us up alive, when their wrath was kindled against us;
then the waters would have overwhelmed us; the flood would have gone over our soul;
then the proud waters would have gone over our soul.
Blessed [be] the LORD, who did not give us [as] a prey to their teeth.
Our soul has escaped as a bird out of the snare of the fowlers; the snare has broken, and we are escaped.
Our help [is] in the name of the LORD, who made the heaven and the earth.:

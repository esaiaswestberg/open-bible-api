<> LORD, my heart has not become haughty, nor mine eyes lofty; neither have I walked in grandeur, nor in wonderful things [above and] beyond that which pertains to me.
Rather [I] have [quieted] myself and caused my soul to become silent, [that I might be] as a child that is weaned of his mother, as one who is weaned from my [own] life.
Let Israel wait for the LORD from now on and for ever.:

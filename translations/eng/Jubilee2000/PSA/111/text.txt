[Aleph] Halelu-JAH. I will praise the LORD with [my] whole heart, [Beth] in the company and [in the] congregation of the upright.
[Gimel] The works of the LORD [are] great, [Daleth] sought out by all those that have pleasure therein.
[He] Honor and beauty [is] his work; [Vau] and his righteousness endures for ever.
[Zain] He has made his wonderful works to be remembered; [Cheth] The LORD [is] gracious and merciful.
[Teth] He has given sustenance unto those that fear him; [Jod] He will ever be mindful of his covenant.
[Caph] He has shown his people the power of his works, [Lamed] by giving them the inheritance of the Gentiles.
[Mem] The works of his hands [are] truth and judgment; [Nun] all his commandments [are] sure.
[Samech] They stand fast from age to age [Ain] and are made in truth and uprightness.
[Pe] He sent redemption unto his people; [Tzaddi] he has commanded his covenant for ever: [Koph] Holy and reverend [is] his name.
[Resh] The fear of the LORD [is] the beginning of wisdom; [Schin] A good understanding have all those that do [his will]; [Tau] His praise endures for ever.:

When Israel went out of Egypt, the house of Jacob from a people of strange language,
Judah was his holiness, [and] Israel his dominion.
The sea saw [it] and fled; Jordan was driven back.
The mountains skipped like rams [and] the little hills like lambs.
What came upon thee, O thou sea, that thou didst flee? [And] thou O Jordan, [that] thou wast driven back?
Ye mountains, [why didst] ye skip like rams [and] ye little hills, like lambs?
At the presence of the Lord, the earth trembles, at the presence of the God of Jacob,
who turned the rock [into] a reservoir of water, the flint into a fountain of waters.:

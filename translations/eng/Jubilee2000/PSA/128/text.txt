<> Blessed [is] every one that fears the LORD, that walks in his ways.
When thou shalt eat the labour of thine hands; happy [shalt] thou [be], and [it shall be] well with thee.
Thy wife [shall be] as a fruitful vine by the sides of thy house; thy children like olive plants round about thy table.
Behold, that thus shall the man be blessed that fears the LORD.
The LORD shall bless thee out of Zion, and thou shalt see the good of Jerusalem all the days of thy life.
Yea, thou shalt see thy children's children [and] peace upon Israel.:

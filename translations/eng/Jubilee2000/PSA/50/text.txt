<> The God of gods, [even] the LORD, has spoken and convocated the earth from the rising of the sun unto the going down thereof.
Out of Zion, the perfection of beauty, God has shined [forth].
Our God shall come and shall not keep silence; a fire shall devour before him, and it shall be very tempestuous round about him.
He shall convocate the heavens of above, and the earth, that he may judge his people.
Gather my merciful ones together unto me, those that have made a covenant with me by sacrifice.
And the heavens shall declare his righteousness, for God himself [is] the judge. Selah.
Hear, O my people, and I will speak; O Israel, and I will testify against thee; I [am] God, [even] thy God.
I will not reprove thee regarding thy sacrifices; thy burnt offerings are continually before me.
I will take no bullock out of thy house, [nor] he goats out of thy folds.
For every beast of the forest [is] mine [and] the cattle upon a thousand hills.
I know all the fowls of the mountains; and the wild beasts of the field [are] with me.
If I were hungry, I would not tell thee; for the world [is] mine and the fullness thereof.
Must I eat the flesh of bulls or drink the blood of goats?
Sacrifice praise unto God and pay thy vows unto the most High
and call upon me in the day of trouble: I will deliver thee, and thou shalt glorify me.
But unto the wicked God saith, What [part] hast thou to declare my statutes or [that] thou should take my covenant in thy mouth?
Seeing thou dost hate chastening and dost cast my words behind thee.
When thou didst see a thief, then thou didst consent with him and hast been partaker with adulterers.
Thou didst give thy mouth to evil, and thy tongue frames deceit.
Thou didst sit [and] speak against thy brother; thou didst slander thine own mother's son.
These [things] hast thou done, and I kept silence; thou didst think that I was altogether [such a one] as thyself, [but] I will reprove thee and set [them] in order before thine eyes.
Now consider this, ye that forget God, lest I take you [away], and [there be] none to deliver.
Whosoever sacrifices praise glorifies me; and to him that orders [his] ways [aright] I will show the salvation of God.:

Bear [with] the one who is sick in the faith, [but] not unto doubtful discernment.
For one believes that he may eat all things; another, who is sick, eats vegetables.
Let not him that eats despise him that does not eat, and let him who eats not judge him that eats; for God has raised him up.
Who art thou that judgest another man's servant? By his [own] master he stands or falls; and [if he falls], he shall be made to stand, for God is powerful to make him stand.
Also, some make a difference between one day and another; others esteem every day [alike]. Let each one be fully persuaded in his own soul.
He that observes the day, let him observe it unto the Lord; and he that does not observe the day, to the Lord he does not observe [it]. He that eats, eats unto the Lord, for he gives God thanks; and he that does not eat, unto the Lord he does not eat, and gives God thanks.
For none of us live for ourselves, and no one dies for himself.
For if we live, we live for the Lord; and if we die, we die for the Lord; whether we live therefore, or die, we are the Lord's.
For to this end Christ both died and rose [and revived]: to thus exercise lordship over the dead as well as over the living.
But why dost thou judge thy brother? or why dost thou belittle thy brother? for we shall all stand before the tribunal of the Christ.
For it is written, As I live, saith the Lord, every knee shall bow to me, and every tongue shall confess to God.
So then each one of us shall give account of himself to God.
Let us, therefore, not judge one another any more, but judge this rather: that no man put a stumblingblock or an occasion to fall in [his] brother's way.
I know and trust in the Lord Jesus that for his sake there is nothing unclean, but to him that esteems any thing to be unclean, to him [it is] unclean.
But if thy brother is grieved because of [thy] food, now thou dost not walk in charity. Do not destroy him with thy food, for whom Christ died.
Let not then your good be evil spoken of;
for the kingdom of God is not food and drink, but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit.
For he that in these things serves the Christ [is] well pleasing unto God and approved of men.
Let us, therefore, follow after the things which make for peace and the edification of each one to the others.
Because of food, do not destroy the work of God. All things indeed [are] clean, but [it is] evil for that man who eats with offense.
[It is] good neither to eat flesh nor to drink wine nor [do any thing] by which thy brother stumbles or is offended or is sick.
Thou hast faith; have [it] to thyself before God. Blessed [is] he that does not condemn himself with that thing which he allows.
And he that makes a difference is condemned if he eats, because [he] does not [eat] by faith; and whatsoever [is] not out of faith is sin.:

Open thy doors, O Lebanon, that the fire may devour thy cedars.
Howl, fir tree, for the cedar is fallen because the magnificent are cut down; howl, O ye oaks of Bashan, for the strong mountain is brought down.
[There is] a voice of the howling of the pastors; for their magnificence is destroyed; a voice of the roaring of young lions, for the pride of the Jordan is destroyed.
Thus hath the LORD my God said, Feed the flock of the slaughter,
whose buyers slayed them and held themselves not guilty; and he that sold them said, Blessed [be] the LORD; for I am rich: and not even their own shepherds had compassion on them.
Therefore I will no longer pity the inhabitants of the land, saith the LORD; but, behold, I will deliver the men each one into his neighbour's hand and into the hand of his king; and they shall smite the land, and I will not deliver [them] out of their hands.
And I will feed the flock of slaughter, [even] you, O poor of the flock. For I took unto me two staves: the one I named Beauty, and the other Bands; and I fed the flock.
I also cut off three shepherds in one month; and my soul was in anguish for them, and their soul also abhorred me.
Then I said, I will not feed you [any longer]; the one that dies, let it die; and the one that is to be lost, let it be lost; and let the rest eat each one the flesh of another.
And I took my staff, [even] Beauty, and cut it asunder, that I might break my covenant which I had made with all the peoples.
And it was broken in that day; and so the poor of the flock that look unto me knew that it [was] the word of the LORD.
And I said unto them, If ye think good, give [me]my wages; and if not, forbear. So they weighed for my wages thirty [pieces] of silver.
And the LORD said unto me, Cast it unto the treasury: a goodly price that I was appraised at by them. And I took the thirty [pieces] of silver and cast them in the house of the LORD unto the treasury.
Then I cut asunder my other staff, [even] Bands, that I might break the brotherhood between Judah and Israel.
And the LORD said unto me, Take unto thee yet the instruments of a foolish shepherd.
For, behold, I raise up a shepherd in the land, [which] shall not visit those that are lost, neither shall seek the young one nor heal the one that is broken nor carry the one that is tired, but he shall eat the flesh of the fat and tear their hoofs in pieces.
Woe to the useless pastor that leaves the flock! the sword [shall be] upon his arm and upon his right eye; his arm shall be completely dried up, and his right eye shall be utterly darkened.:

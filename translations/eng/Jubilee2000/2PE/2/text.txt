But there were also false prophets among the people, even as there shall be false teachers among you, who covertly shall bring in destructive sects and shall deny the Lord that bought them, bringing upon themselves swift destruction.
And many shall follow their pernicious ways, by reason of whom the way of truth shall be blasphemed;
and in covetousness they shall make merchandise of you with feigned words, upon whom the condemnation from a long time ago does not delay, and their perdition does not sleep.
For if God did not forgive the angels that sinned, but cast [them] down into the deepest abyss and delivered [them] into chains of darkness, to be reserved unto judgment;
and if [he] did not forgive the old world, but kept Noah, a preacher of righteousness, with seven other persons, bringing in the flood upon the world of the ungodly;
and if [he] condemned by destruction the cities of Sodom and Gomorrha, turning them into ashes, making [them] an example unto those that after should live without fear and reverence of God;
and delivered just Lot, who was persecuted by those abominable [people] because of their nefarious conversation;
(for that righteous man dwelling among them, in seeing and hearing, afflicted [his] righteous soul from day to day with the deeds of those unjust [people]);
the Lord knows how to deliver the godly out of temptations and to reserve the unjust unto the day of judgment to be punished;
and chiefly those that walk after the flesh in the lust of uncleanness and despise dominion; presumptuous, arrogant, they are not afraid to speak evil of the higher powers;
whereas even the angels, who are greater in power and might, bring no curse of judgment against them before the Lord.
But these, speaking evil of the things that they do not understand (as natural animals without reason, who are made to be taken and destroyed), shall utterly perish in their own corruption,
receiving the reward of their unrighteousness, [as] those that count it pleasure to live luxuriously every day. These are spots and blemishes, who eat [together] with you, while at the same time they revel in their deceit,
having their eyes full of adultery, and not knowing [how] to cease from sin, baiting unstable souls, having their heart exercised in covetous practices; cursed sons,
who forsaking the right way have erred, having followed the way of Balaam [the son] of Beor, who loved the wages of unrighteousness,
and was rebuked for his iniquity; a dumb animal accustomed to a yoke (upon which he was seated), speaking with man's voice, hindered the madness of the prophet.
These are wells without water, clouds that are brought by [a] whirlwind, to whom gross darkness is reserved for ever.
For speaking arrogant words of vanity, they allure through the lusts of the flesh, [through much] wantonness, those that were clean escaped from those who converse in error,
promising them liberty, being they themselves the servants of corruption: for he who is overcome by someone is subject to bondage by the one that overcame him.
Certainly, if having separated themselves from the contaminations of the world, by the knowledge of the Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, they again entangle themselves therein and are overcome, their latter end is made worse for them than the beginnings.
For it would have been better for them not to have known the way of righteousness, than, after they have known [it], to turn back from the holy commandment delivered unto them.
But it has happened unto them according to the true proverb, The dog returns unto his own vomit, and the sow that was washed to her wallowing in the mire.:

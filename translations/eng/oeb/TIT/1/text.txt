From Paul, a servant of God, and an apostle of Jesus Christ, charged to strengthen the faith of God’s chosen people, and their knowledge of that truth which makes for godliness
and is based on the hope of eternal life, which God, who never lies, promised before the ages began,
and has revealed at his own time in his message, with the proclamation of which I was entrusted by the command of God our Savior.
To Titus, my true child in our one faith: May God, the Father, and Christ Jesus, our Savior, bless you and give you peace.

They are to be of irreproachable character, faithful to their partners, whose children are Christians and have never been charged with dissolute conduct or have been unruly.

Everything is pure to the pure-minded, but to those whose minds are polluted and who are unbelievers nothing is pure. Their minds and consciences are alike polluted.

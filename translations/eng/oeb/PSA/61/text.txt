Hear my cry, O God, be attentive to my prayer.
From the ends of the earth I call unto you, when my heart is faint: lead me to the rock that is high above me.
For you are a refuge to me, a strong tower in face of the foe.
O to be guest in your tent forever, hiding beneath your sheltering wings! (Selah)
For you, O God, do hear my vows, and grant the desires of those who fear you.
Add many days to the life of the king; may his years endure throughout all generations.
In the presence of God be he throned forever; may kindness and faithfulness watch over him.
And I will sing praise to your name forever, paying my vows day after day.

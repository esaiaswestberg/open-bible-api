Praise the Lord from the heavens, praise him in the heights.
Praise him, all his angels; praise him, all his hosts.
Praise him, sun and moon; praise him, all stars of light.
Praise him, you highest heavens, and you waters above the heavens.
Let them praise the name of the Lord, for at his command they were made.
And he fixed them for ever and ever by a law which they dare not transgress.
Praise the Lord from the earth: you depths, with your monsters, all.
Fire, hail, snow and ice, and stormy wind doing his word.
All you mountains and hills, all you fruit trees and cedars,
all you wild beasts and tame, creeping things, birds on the wing.
All you kings and nations of earth; all you princes and judges of earth:
young men and maidens together, old men and children together.
Let them praise the name of the Lord, for his name alone is exalted. Over heaven and earth is his glory.
He has lifted his people to honour. Wherefore this chorus of praise from his saints, from Israel, the people who stand in his fellowship. Hallelujah.

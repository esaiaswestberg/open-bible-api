On the holy mountain stands the city he founded.
The Lord loves the gates of Zion more than all the dwellings of Jacob.
Glorious things he is speaking of you, you city of God. (Selah)
“Among those who are mine I name Rahab and Babylon, Philistia, Tyre, Ethiopia, their people will say I was born in Zion.
As for Zion it will be said each and all were born in her.” The Lord will preserve her.
The Lord shall count, when enrolling the peoples, “This one was born there, and that one was born there.” (Selah)
Singers and dancers alike will say “All my springs are in you.”

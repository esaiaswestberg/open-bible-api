Heathen, O God, have come into your land, defiling your holy temple, and laying Jerusalem in ruins.
They have given the bodies of your dead servants to the birds of the air to devour, and the flesh of your faithful to the beasts of the field.
Round about Jerusalem they have poured out their blood like water; and there was no one to bury them.
On every side our neighbours revile us and mock us and jeer at us.
How long will you be angry, O Lord? Will your jealousy burn like fire forever?
Pour out your wrath on the nations that don’t know you, on the kingdoms that do not call on your name.
For Jacob they devoured, they have desolated his home.
Do not remember against us our ancestor's sins; O meet us soon with your pity, for utterly weak are we.
Help us, O God our saviour, for the renown of your name: for your reputation deliver us and cover over our sins.
Why should the nations say, “Where is their God?” Let revenge for the outpoured blood of your servants be shown on the heathen before our eyes.
May the groans of the prisoner come before you; free the children of death by your mighty arm.
Pay our neighbours back sevenfold for the scorn they have heaped upon you, O Lord.
Then we, your people, the flock of your pasture, will give thanks to you for evermore, and tell your praise to all generations.

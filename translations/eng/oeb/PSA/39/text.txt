I vowed to watch my words, and sin not with my tongue, but to put on my mouth a muzzle, while the wicked were in my presence.
I was silent and dumb, speechless: but my pain was stirred up.
My heart grew hot within me; as I mused, the fire was kindled, till at last the words came to my tongue.
“Teach me, O Lord, my end, and the sum of my days what it is. Let me know how transient I am.
See! My days you have made but a span, and my life is as nothing before you. It is but as a breath that everyone stands: (Selah)
it is but in mere semblance we walk to and fro, and all our noise is for nothing. We heaps up, and knows not who will gather.”
And now, what wait I for, Lord? My hope is in you.
From all my transgressions deliver me; make me not the scorn of the fool.
I am dumb, never opening my mouth, for this is your own doing.
Remove your stroke from off me: by the might of your hand I am spent.
When you rebuke someone to punish their sins, you consume, like a moth, what they treasure. Everyone is only a breath. (Selah)
Hear my prayer, O Lord; attend to my cry for help. Hold not your peace at my tears. For I am but a guest of yours, a stranger visiting, like all my ancestors.
Look away from me, let me smile again, before I die and am gone.

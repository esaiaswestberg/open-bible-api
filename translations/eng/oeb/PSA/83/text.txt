Do not keep silent, O God: hold not your peace, be not still, God.
For see! Your enemies roar, those who hate you lift up their heads,
laying crafty plans for your people, and plotting against those you treasure.
“Come, let us wipe them out as a nation, so Israel’s name will be mentioned no more.”
For, conspiring with one accord, they have made a league against you
Tents of Edom, and Ishmaelites, Moab, and the Hagrites.
Gebal and Ammon and Amalek, Philistia, with the people of Tyre;
Syria, too, is confederate, they have strengthened the children of Lot. (Selah)
Deal with them as you dealt with Midian, with Sisera, with Jabin, at the torrent of Kishon,
who at Endor were destroyed, and became dung for the field.
Make their nobles like Oreb and Zeeb, all their princes like Zebah and Zalmunna,
who said, “Let us take for ourselves the meadows of God.”
Whirl them, my God, like dust, like stubble before the wind.
As the fire that kindles the forest, as flame that sets mountains ablaze,
so with your tempest pursue them, terrify them with your hurricane.
Make them blush with shame; until they seek your name, O Lord.
Everlasting shame and confusion, disgrace and destruction be theirs.
Teach those who you alone are most high over all the earth.

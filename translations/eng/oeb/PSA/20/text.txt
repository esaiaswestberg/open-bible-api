The Lord answer you in the day of distress, the name of the God of Jacob protect you,
sending you help from the temple, and out of Zion supporting you.
All your meal-offerings may he remember, your burnt-offerings look on with favour. (Selah)
May he grant you your heart’s desire, and bring all your designs to fruition.
We will shout then for joy at your victory, and rejoice in the name of our God. May the Lord fulfil all your petitions.
Now I am sure that the Lord will give victory to his anointed. From his temple in heaven he will answer by his mighty triumphant right hand.
Some in chariots are strong, some in horses; but our strength is the Lord our God.
As for them, they will totter and fall, while we rise and stand firm.
Give victory, Lord, to the king, and answer us when we call.

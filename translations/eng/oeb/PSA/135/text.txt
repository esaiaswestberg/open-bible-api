Hallelujah. Praise the name of the Lord. Praise the Lord, you his servants,
who stand in the house of the Lord, in the courts of the house of our God.
Praise the Lord, for the Lord is good: ‘Sing praise to his name it is pleasant.
The Lord for himself chose Jacob, Israel as his own special treasure.
For I know that the Lord is great, that our Lord is above all gods.
All that he wills he does in the heavens and on the earth, in the seas and in all the abysses.
Clouds he brings up from the ends of the earth, lightnings he makes for the rain, wind he brings out of his storehouses.
The first-born of Egypt he struck, both humans and animals.
Signs and wonders he sent into your midst, O Egypt, upon Pharaoh and all his servants.
Many nations he struck, mighty kings he slew
Sihon, king of the Amorites, Og, king of Bashan, and all the kingdoms of Canaan.
He gave their land for possession, possession to Israel his people.
Your name, O Lord, is forever; your memorial world without end.
For the Lord secures right for his people, and takes pity upon his servants.
The idols of heathen are silver made by human hands.
They have mouths, but cannot speak: they have eyes, but cannot see.
They have ears, but cannot hear: there is no breath in their mouths.
Their makers become like them, so do all who trust in them.
House of Israel, bless the Lord: house of Araon, bless the Lord.
House of Levi, bless the Lord: you who fear the Lord, bless the Lord.
Blest be the Lord out of Zion, who lives in Jerusalem. Hallelujah.

How long, Lord, will you forget me forever? How long will you hide your face from me?
How long must I nurse grief inside me, and in my heart a daily sorrow? How long are my foes to exult over me?
Look at me, answer me, Lord my God. Fill my eyes with your light, lest I sleep in death,
lest my enemies claim to have triumphed, lest my foes rejoice at my downfall.
But I trust in your kindness: my heart will rejoice in your help.
I will sing to the Lord who was good to me.

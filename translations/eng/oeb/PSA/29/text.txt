Ascribe to the Lord, you heavenly beings, ascribe to the Lord glory and power
Ascribe to the Lord the glory he manifests: bow to the Lord in holy array.
The Lord’s voice peals on the waters. The God of glory has thundered. He peals o’er the mighty waters.
The Lord’s voice sounds with strength, the Lord’s voice sounds with majesty.
The Lord’s voice breaks the cedars, he breaks the cedars of Lebanon,
making Lebanon dance like a calf, Sirion like a young wild ox.
The Lord’s voice hews out flames of fire.
The Lord’s voice rends the desert, he rends the desert of Kadesh.
The Lord’s voice whirls the oaks, and strips the forests bare; and all in his temple say “Glory.”
The Lord was king at the flood, the Lord sits throned forever.
The Lord gives strength to his people, he blesses his people with peace.

Judge me, O God, and plead my case against an unfaithful nation. From a man of deceit and wickedness rescue me,
because you are the God of my refuge. Why have you rejected me? Why must I go about mourning because of the oppression of the enemy?
Send your light and your truth; they shall lead me. They shall bring me to ⌞your holy mountain⌟ and to your dwelling places.
Then I will go to the altar of God, to God, ⌞my surpassing joy⌟, and I will praise you with lyre, O God, my God.
Why are you ⌞in despair⌟, O my soul? And why are you disturbed within me? Hope in God, because I will again praise him, ⌞my salvation⌟ and my God.

How long, O Yahweh? Will you forget me forever? How long will you hide your face from me?
How long must I take counsel in my soul, and sorrow in my heart all the day? How long will my enemy be exalted over me?
Consider and answer me, O Yahweh my God. Give light to my eyes lest I sleep the sleep of death,
and lest my enemy should say, “I have overcome him,” lest my enemies rejoice because I am shaken.
But as for me, I have trusted in your steadfast love. My heart will rejoice in your deliverance.
I will sing to Yahweh because he has dealt bountifully with me.

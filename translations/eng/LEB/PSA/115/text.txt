Not to us, O Yahweh, not to us, but to your name give glory, because of your loyal love, because of your faithfulness.
Why should the nations say, “Where, ⌞pray tell⌟, is their God?”
But our God is in the heavens; all that he desires, he does.
Their idols are silver and gold, the work of human hands.
They have mouths, but cannot speak; they have eyes, but cannot see;
they have ears, but cannot hear; they have noses, but cannot smell;
they have their hands, but they cannot feel, their feet, but they cannot walk; they cannot utter a sound in their throats.
Those who make them become like them, as does everyone who trusts in them.
O Israel, trust Yahweh; he is their help and their shield.
O house of Aaron, trust in Yahweh; he is their help and their shield.
You who fear Yahweh, trust in Yahweh; he is their help and their shield.
Yahweh remembers us; he will bless us. He will bless the house of Israel; he will bless the house of Aaron.
He will bless those who fear Yahweh, the small with the great.
May Yahweh give you increase, you and your children.
May you be blessed by Yahweh, who made heaven and earth.
The heavens are Yahweh’s heavens, but the earth he has given to the children of humankind.
The dead do not praise Yah, nor any descending into silence.
It is we, we will bless Yah from now until forever. Praise Yah!

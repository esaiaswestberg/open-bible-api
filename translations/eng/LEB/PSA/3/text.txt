Yahweh, how many are my enemies; many are rising against me.
Many are saying about my soul, “There is no deliverance for him from God. Selah
But you, Yahweh, are a shield around me, my glory and the one who lifts up my head.
With my voice I call to Yahweh and he answers me from ⌞his holy hill⌟. Selah
I lay down and slept; I woke up because Yahweh sustains me.
I am not afraid of the ten thousands of people who all around have set themselves against me.
Rise up, O Yahweh; deliver me, O my God; for you strike all my enemies on the cheek. The teeth of the wicked you break.
To Yahweh belongs deliverance; may your blessing be over your people. Selah

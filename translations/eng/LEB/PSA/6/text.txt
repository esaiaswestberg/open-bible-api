A psalm of David.  O Yahweh, do not rebuke me in your anger, and do not discipline me in your wrath.
Be gracious to me, O Yahweh, because I am feeble. Heal me, O Yahweh, for my bones are terrified.
My soul is also very terrified. But you, O Yahweh, how long?
Turn, O Yahweh; deliver my life. Save me for the sake of your steadfast love.
For there is no remembrance of you in death. In Sheol, who will give thanks to you?
I am weary with my groaning; ⌞I flood⌟ my bed every night. With my tears ⌞I drench⌟ my couch.
My eye wastes away because of vexation; it grows old because of all my oppressors.
Depart from me, all workers of evil, for Yahweh has heard the sound of my weeping.
Yahweh has heard my plea; Yahweh has accepted my prayer.
All my enemies shall be ashamed and shall be very terrified. They shall turn back; they shall suddenly be ashamed.

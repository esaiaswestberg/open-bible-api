Of Asaph. A psalm.  I cry out with my voice to God; with my voice to God, that he may hear me.
In the day I have trouble, I seek the Lord. At night my hand stretches out ⌞continually⌟; my soul refuses to be comforted.
I remember God and I groan loudly; I meditate and my spirit grows faint.
You hold open my eyelids. I am troubled and cannot speak.
I think about the days from long ago, the years of ancient times.
I remember my song in the night. With my heart I meditate, and my spirit searches to understand.
Will the Lord reject us forever, and will he never be pleased with us again?
Has his loyal love ceased forever? Is his promise ended throughout generations?
Has God forgotten to have compassion? Or has he closed off his mercies in anger? Selah
So I said, “This pierces me— the right hand of the Most High has changed.”
I will remember the deeds of Yah. Surely I will remember your wonders from long ago.
I will also muse on all your work, and meditate on your deeds.
O God, your way is distinctive. Who is a great god like our God?
You are the God who works wonders; you have made known your might among the peoples.
With your arm you redeemed your people, the children of Jacob and Joseph. Selah
Waters saw you, O God; waters saw you and they trembled. Surely the deeps shook.
The clouds poured out water. The skies ⌞thundered⌟. Your arrows also ⌞flew about⌟.
The sound of your thunder was in the whirlwind; lightnings lit the world; the earth shook and quaked.
Your way was through the sea, and your path through many waters. Yet your footprints were not discerned.
You led your people like a flock by the hand of Moses and Aaron.

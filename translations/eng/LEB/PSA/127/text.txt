Unless Yahweh builds a house, its builders labor at it in vain. Unless Yahweh guards a city, a guard watches in vain.
It is in vain for you who rise early and sit late, eating the bread of anxious toil, when thus he provides for his beloved in his sleep.
Look, children are the heritage of Yahweh; the fruit of the womb is a reward.
Like arrows in the hand of a warrior, so are the children of one’s youth.
Blessed is the man who fills his quiver with them. They shall not be put to shame when they speak with enemies at the gate.

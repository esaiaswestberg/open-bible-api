O Yahweh, who may reside in your tent? Who may dwell on your holy mountain?
He who walks blamelessly and does what is right. He who speaks honestly in his heart.
He does not slander with his tongue. He does not harm his friend, nor ⌞bring up⌟ a disgrace against his neighbor.
In his eyes a rejected one is contemptible, but he honors those who respect Yahweh. He takes an oath to his own injury and does not retract it.
He does not lend his money at interest, and does not take a bribe against the innocent. He who does these things will never be shaken.

Praise Yah. Sing to Yahweh a new song, his praise in the assembly of the faithful.
Let Israel be glad in its maker; let the children of Zion rejoice in their king.
Let them praise his name with dancing; let them sing praises to him with tambourine and lyre.
For Yahweh takes pleasure in his people; he glorifies the afflicted with salvation.
Let the faithful exult in glory; let them sing for joy on their beds.
Let the extolling of God be in their throat, and a double-edged sword in their hand,
to execute vengeance on the nations and punishment on the peoples,
to bind their kings with chains and their ⌞nobles⌟ with fetters of iron,
to execute on them the judgment that is decreed. This will be honor for all his faithful ones; Praise Yah.

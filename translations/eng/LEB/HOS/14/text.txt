Return to Yahweh your God, O Israel, for you have stumbled because of your sin.
Take words with you, and return to Yahweh. Say to him, “Take away all guilt; accept good, and we will offer the fruit of our lips.
Assyria will not save us; we will not ride on horses, and we will say no more, “Our God,” to the work of our hands because in you the fatherless child finds mercy.
I will heal their disloyalty; I will love them freely because my anger has turned back from them.
I will be like the dew to Israel; he will blossom like the lily plant, and he will strike his roots like the trees of Lebanon.
His new plant shoots will spread out; his splendor will be like the olive tree, and his scent like the trees of Lebanon.
⌞They will again dwell⌟ in my shadow; they will grow grain and they will blossom like the plant vine; his fame will be like the wine of Lebanon.
O Ephraim, ⌞what have I to do⌟ with idols? I myself have answered and looked after you. I am like a luxuriant cypress; your fruit comes from me.
Who is wise that he can understand these things? Who is discerning that he knows them? The ways of Yahweh are right, and the righteous walk in them; but transgressors stumble in them.

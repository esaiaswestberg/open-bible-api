Therefore, I urge first of all that petitions, prayers, requests, and thanksgiving be made on behalf of all people,
on behalf of kings and all those who are in authority, in order that we may live a tranquil and quiet life in all godliness and dignity.
This is good and acceptable before God our Savior,
who wants all people to be saved and to come to a knowledge of the truth.
For there is one God and one mediator between God and human beings, the man Christ Jesus,
who gave himself a ransom for all, the testimony at the proper time,
for which I was appointed a herald and an apostle—I am speaking the truth, I am not lying—a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and truth.
Therefore I want the men in every place to pray, lifting up holy hands without anger and dispute.
Likewise also the women should adorn themselves in appropriate clothing, with modesty and self-control, not with braided hair and gold jewelry or pearls or expensive clothing,
but with good deeds which are fitting for women who profess godliness.
A woman must learn in quietness with all submission.
But I do not permit a woman to teach or to exercise authority over a man, but ⌞to remain quiet⌟.
For Adam was formed first, then Eve,
and Adam was not deceived, but the woman, because she was deceived, came into transgression.
But she will be saved through the bearing of children, if she continues in faith and love and holiness with self-control.

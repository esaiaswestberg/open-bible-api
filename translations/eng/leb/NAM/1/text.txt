The oracle concerning Nineveh— the scroll of the vision of Nahum the Elkoshite:
Yahweh is a jealous God and avenging; Yahweh is avenging and ⌞full of wrath⌟. Yahweh takes vengeance against his enemies; he rages against his adversaries.
Yahweh is slow to anger but great in power; he will certainly not allow the guilty to go unpunished. ⌞He marches⌟ in storm wind and in gale; storm clouds are the dust of his feet.
He rebukes the sea and he dries up the rivers; he makes all the rivers run dry. Bashan and Carmel wither; the blossom of Lebanon languishes.
Mountains quake before him; the hills shake apart. The earth heaves before him— the world and all her inhabitants.
His indignation—who can stand before it? Who can endure ⌞his fierce anger⌟? His wrath is poured out like fire; rocks are shattered before him.
Yahweh is good—a refuge in the day of distress; he knows those who take refuge in him.
But with a rushing torrent he will bring Nineveh to an end; he will chase his enemies into darkness.
What do you plot against Yahweh? ⌞He will completely destroy it⌟; trouble will not rise up a second time!
For like entangled thorns, and like their drink which is drunk, they will be consumed like fully dry chaff.
From you goes out one who plots evil against Yahweh, one who plans wickedness.
Yahweh says this:   “Even though they are powerful and likewise many, even so they will be cut off and pass away. Though I have afflicted you, I will afflict you no longer.
And now, I will break his yoke from upon you; I will snap your bonds.”
Yahweh has commanded concerning you:   “Your name will no longer be sown. I will cut off ⌞the idols and images⌟ from the ⌞temple⌟ of your gods; ⌞I will send you to the grave⌟ because you are worthless.”
Look! On the mountains! The feet of the one who brings good tidings, the one who proclaims peace! “Celebrate a festival, O Judah, Fulfill your vows! For he will not invade you again; the wicked one is cut off completely!”

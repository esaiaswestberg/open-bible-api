Therefore when we could bear it no longer, we determined to be left behind in Athens alone,
and we sent Timothy, our brother and fellow worker for God in the gospel of Christ, in order to strengthen and to encourage you about your faith,
so that no one would be shaken by these afflictions. For you yourselves know that we are appointed for this,
for indeed when we were with you we told you beforehand that we were about to be afflicted, just as indeed it happened, and you know.
Because of this, I also, when I could endure it no longer, sent in order to know your faith, lest somehow the tempter tempted you and our labor should be in vain.
But now, because Timothy has come to us from you and has brought good news to us of your faith and love, and that ⌞you always think kindly of us⌟, desiring to see us just as also we desire to see you,
because of this, brothers, we have been comforted because of you in all our distress and affliction through your faith,
because now we live, if you stand firm in the Lord.
For what thanks can we repay to God concerning you, because of all the joy with which we rejoice because of you before our God,
night and day praying beyond all measure that we may see your face and complete what is lacking in your faith?
Now may our God and Father himself and our Lord Jesus direct our way to you,
and may the Lord cause you to increase and to abound in love for one another and for all, just as also we do for you,
so that your hearts may be established blameless in holiness before our God and Father at the coming of our Lord Jesus with all his saints.

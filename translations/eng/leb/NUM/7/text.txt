On the day Moses finished setting up the tabernacle and appointed and consecrated it and all its vessels, and the altar and its vessels, and he appointed them and consecrated them,
the leaders of Israel, the heads of ⌞the families⌟, presented an offering; they were the leaders of the tribes and were the ones in charge of the counting.
They brought their offering before the presence of Yahweh, six covered utility carts and twelve cattle, a utility cart for two of the leaders, and a bull for each; and they presented them ⌞before⌟ the tabernacle.
Yahweh said to Moses, saying,
“⌞Take them⌟, and they will be used to do the work of the tent of the assembly; and you will give them to the Levites, each ⌞according to his required service⌟.”
So Moses took the utility carts and the cattle, and he gave them to the Levites.
Two utility carts and four cattle he gave to the descendants of Gershon ⌞according to their required service⌟;
and four utility carts and eight cattle he gave to the descendants of Merari ⌞according to their required service⌟, ⌞under the authority of⌟ Ithamar son of Aaron the priest.
But to the descendants of Kohath he did not give anything because the work of the sanctuary they carried upon them on their shoulders.

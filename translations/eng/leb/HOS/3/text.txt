And Yahweh said to me again, “Go, love a woman ⌞who has a lover⌟ and is committing adultery, just like the love of Yahweh for the children of Israel, but they are turning to other gods and love raisin cakes.”
So I bought her for fifteen shekels of silver and a homer of barely and a measure of wine.
And I said to her, “⌞You must remain as mine⌟ for many days, and you will not play the whore; ⌞you will not belong⌟ to a man, and I will belong to you.”
The children of Israel will remain for many days without a king and prince, without sacrifice and stone pillar, ephod and teraphim.
Afterward the children of Israel will return and seek Yahweh their God and David their king. They will come in fear to Yahweh and to his goodness at the end of days.

Put to your lips the trumpet like a vulture over the house of Yahweh, because they have ⌞broken my covenant⌟ and rebelled against my law.
They cry out to me, “My God! We, Israel, know you!”
Israel has spurned the good; the enemy will pursue him.
They appointed kings, but not through me; they made officials, but without my knowledge. With their silver and gold they made idols for themselves for their own ⌞destruction⌟.
Your calf is rejected, O Samaria; my anger burns against them. How long will they be incapable of innocence?
Because it is from Israel, an artisan made it, it is not a god; for the calf of Samaria will be broken to pieces.
Because they sow the wind, they will reap the whirlwind. The standing grain does not have heads; it will not yield flour. And if it would yield, strangers would devour it.
Israel is swallowed up; now they are among the nations, like an object that no one desires.
For they have gone up to Assyria, a wild donkey alone to itself; Ephraim has sold itself for lovers.
Even though they have sold themselves to the nations, now I will gather them. They will soon writhe from the burden of kings and princes.
When Ephraim multiplied altars to expiate sins, they became to him altars to sin on.
I write for him myriads of my instruction; they are regarded as a strange thing.
They offer sacrifices of my choice and they eat flesh; Yahweh does not accept them. Now he will remember their iniquity and punish their sins; they will return to Egypt.
Israel has forgotten his maker and built palaces, and Judah has multiplied fortified cities; but I will send fire on his cities and it will devour her strongholds.

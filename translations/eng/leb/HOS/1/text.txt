The word of Yahweh that came to Hosea son of Beeri, in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, the kings of Judah, and in the days of Jeroboam the son of Joash, king of Israel.
⌞At the beginning when Yahweh spoke⌟ through Hosea, Yahweh said to Hosea, “Go, take for yourself a wife and children of whoredom, because the land commits great whoredom ⌞forsaking Yahweh⌟.”
So he went and took Gomer daughter of Diblaim, and she conceived and bore him a son.
And Yahweh said to him, “⌞Name him⌟ Jezreel; because in a little while ⌞I will punish⌟ the house of Jehu for the blood of Jezreel, and I will put an end to the kingdom of the house of Israel.
⌞On that day⌟ I will break the bow of Israel in the Valley of Jezreel.”
And she conceived again and bore a daughter, and he said to him,   “⌞Name her⌟ Lo-ruhamah, for I will no longer have pity on the house of Israel or ⌞forgive them⌟.
But I will have pity on the house of Judah and I will save them by Yahweh their God, and will not deliver them by bow, sword, war, horses, or horsemen.
And when she had weaned Lo-ruhamah, she conceived and bore a son.
And he said, “⌞Name him⌟ Lo-ammi, for you are not my people and I am not your God.
The number of the children of Israel will be like the sand of the sea that cannot be measured or counted; and in the place where it is said to them, “You are not my people,” it will be said to them, “Children of the living God.”
Then the children of Judah and Israel will be gathered together, and they will appoint for themselves one head; and ⌞they will take possession of⌟ the land, for great is the day of Jezreel.

I lift up my eyes to you, the one enthroned in the heavens.
Behold, as the eyes of servants look to the hand of their master, as the eyes of a maid to the hand of her mistress, so our eyes look to Yahweh our God, until he is gracious to us.
Be gracious to us, O Yahweh, be gracious to us, for long enough we have had our fill of contempt.
For long enough our soul has had its fill of the derision of the self-confident, the contempt of the arrogant.

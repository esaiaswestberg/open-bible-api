A psalm of Asaph. A song.  We give thanks to you, O God; we give thanks, and your name is near. Your wonderful deeds are told.
“I will indeed set an appointed time; I will judge fairly.
The earth and all its inhabitants are shaking; I steady its columns. Selah
I say to the boastful, ‘Do not boast!’ and to the wicked, ‘Do not lift up your horn!
Do not lift up high your horn. Do not speak with ⌞arrogant pride⌟.’ ”
For it is not from the east or the west and not from the south that lifting up comes,
rather God is the judge; one he brings low, and another he lifts up.
For there is a cup in the hand of Yahweh with wine that foams, fully mixed, and he pours out from this. Surely all the wicked of the land ⌞will quaff it down to its dregs⌟.
But as for me, I will proclaim forever; I will sing praise to the God of Jacob.
“And all the horns of the wicked I will cut off. The horns of the righteous will be lifted up.”

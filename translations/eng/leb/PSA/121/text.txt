I lift up my eyes to the mountains; whence will my help come?
My help is from Yahweh, maker of heaven and earth.
He will not allow your foot to be moved; he who protects you will not slumber.
Look, he will not slumber and he will not sleep— he who protects Israel.
Yahweh is your protector; Yahweh is your shade at your right hand.
The sun will not strike you by day, nor the moon by night.
Yahweh will protect you from all evil; he will protect your life.
Yahweh will protect your going out and your coming in from now until forever.

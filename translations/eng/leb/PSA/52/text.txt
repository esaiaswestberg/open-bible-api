When Doeg the Edomite came and informed Saul. And he said to him, “David has come to the house of Ahimelech.”  Why do you boast about evil, O mighty man? The loyal love of God endures ⌞continually⌟.
Your tongue plans destruction, like a sharp razor, working deceit.
You love evil more than good, a lie more than speaking ⌞what is right⌟. Selah
You love all devouring words, O deceitful tongue,
but God will pull you down forever. He will snatch you and tear you away from your tent, and he will uproot you from the land of the living. Selah
And the righteous will see and fear, and will laugh at him, saying,
“Look, the man who would not make God his refuge, but he trusted in the greatness of his wealth; he took refuge in his destructiveness.”
But I am like an olive tree flourishing in the house of God. I trust the loyal love of God forever and ever.
I will give thanks to you forever, because of what you have done, and I will wait on your name, because it is good, in the presence of your faithful ones.

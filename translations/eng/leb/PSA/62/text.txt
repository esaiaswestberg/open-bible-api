A psalm of David.  Only for God my soul waits in silence. From him is my salvation.
Only he is my rock and my salvation, my high stronghold; I shall not be greatly shaken.
How long will you attack a man? All of you will be shattered like a leaning wall, a tottering fence.
They only plan to thrust him down from his high position; they are pleased with deception. With their mouths they bless, but ⌞inwardly⌟ they curse. Selah
Only for God wait in silence, O my soul, because my hope is from him.
Only he is my rock and my salvation, my high stronghold; I shall not be shaken.
On God rests my salvation and my glory; God is my strong rock, my refuge.
Trust him at all times, O people; pour out before him your heart. God is a refuge for us. Selah
Only a vapor are men of low degree, a deception are men of high degree. ⌞Weighed⌟ in a balance, together they are lighter than a vapor.
Do not trust in extortion, and do not put vain confidence in robbery. If wealth increases, do not set your heart on it.
Once God has spoken; twice I have heard this: that strength belongs to God.
And to you belongs loyal love, O Lord, because you will render to each according to his work.

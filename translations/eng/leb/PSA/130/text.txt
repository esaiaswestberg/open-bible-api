Out of the depths I call to you, O Yahweh.
“O Lord, hear my voice. Let your ears be attentive to the voice of my supplications.
If you, O Yah, should ⌞keep track of⌟ iniquities, O Lord, who could stand?
But with you is forgiveness, so that you may be feared.”
I await Yahweh; my soul awaits, and I wait for his word.
My soul waits for the Lord more than watchmen for the morning. Yes, more than watchmen for the morning.
O Israel, wait for Yahweh. For with Yahweh there is loyal love, and with him there is abundant redemption.
And he will redeem Israel from all its iniquities.

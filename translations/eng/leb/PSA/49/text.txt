Hear this, all you peoples; give ear, all you inhabitants of the world,
both low and high, rich and poor together.
My mouth will speak wisdom, and the meditation of my heart will be understanding.
I will incline my ear to a proverb; I will ⌞propound⌟ my riddle on a lyre.
Why should I fear in ⌞times of calamity⌟, when iniquity surrounds me at my heels,
those who trust their wealth and boast about the abundance of their riches?
Surely a man cannot redeem a brother. He cannot give to God his ransom
(since the redemption price for their life is costly and it always fails),
so that he may stay alive forever and not see the pit.
For he sees that the wise die, together with the fool and brute they perish, and leave their wealth to the next generation.
Within them they think their houses are forever, their dwelling places from generation to generation. They ⌞name⌟ their lands by their own names.
But man cannot continue in his pomp. He is like the beasts that perish.
This is the journey of those who have foolish confidence, and those after them who accept their sayings. Selah
Like sheep they are destined to Sheol; death will shepherd them. But the upright will rule over them in the morning, and their forms will be for Sheol to consume, far from his lofty abode.
Surely God will ransom my life from the ⌞power⌟ of Sheol, because he will receive me. Selah
Do not fear when a man becomes rich, when the wealth of his house increases,
because when he dies he will not take away any of it. His wealth will not follow down after him.
Though he congratulated his soul while he was living —and people will praise you when you do well for yourself—
it will go to the generation of his fathers. Never will they see light.
Humankind in its pomp, but does not understand, is like the beasts that perish.

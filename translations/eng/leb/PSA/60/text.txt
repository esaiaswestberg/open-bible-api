A miktam of David. To teach. When he fought Mesopotamia and Aram Zobah, and Joab returned and struck Edom in the Valley of Salt, twelve thousand persons.  O God, you have rejected us. You have broken us. You have been angry. Restore us!
You have made the land quake. You have split it open. Heal its fissures, because it totters.
You have shown your people hard things; You have given us wine that staggers.
You have rallied those who fear you round a banner ⌞out of bowshot⌟, Selah
so that your beloved ones may be rescued. Save by your right hand and answer us.
God has spoken in his holiness, “I will rejoice; I will divide up Shechem, and portion out the valley of Succoth.
Gilead is mine, and Manasseh is mine, and Ephraim is the ⌞helmet for⌟ my head; Judah is my scepter.
Moab is my washing pot; over Edom, I will cast my sandal. On account of me, O Philistia, raise a shout.”
Who will bring me to the fortified city? Who will lead me to Edom?
Have not you yourself rejected us, O God, and not gone out with our armies, O God?
Give us help against the adversary, for the help of humankind is futile.
Through God we will do ⌞valiantly⌟, and it is he who will tread down our enemies.

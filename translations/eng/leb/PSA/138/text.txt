I give you thanks with my whole heart; before the gods I sing your praise.
I bow down toward your holy temple and give thanks to your name, because of your loyal love and faithfulness, for you have magnified your word according to all your name.
⌞When⌟ I called and you answered me, you emboldened me in my soul with strength.
All the kings of the earth will praise you, O Yahweh, when they have heard the words of your mouth,
and they will sing of the ways of Yahweh, because Yahweh’s glory is great.
Though Yahweh is high, yet he sees the lowly, but the proud he perceives at a distance.
Though I walk in the midst of trouble, you preserve me alive. You stretch out your hand against the anger of my enemies, and you save me with your right hand.
Yahweh accomplishes things for my benefit. O Yahweh, your loyal love endures forever; do not abandon the works of your hands.

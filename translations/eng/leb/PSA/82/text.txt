God stands in the divine assembly; he administers judgment in the midst of the gods.
“How long will you judge unjustly and ⌞show favoritism to the wicked⌟? Selah
Judge on behalf of the helpless and the orphan; provide justice to the afflicted and the poor.
Rescue the helpless and the needy; deliver them from the hand of the wicked.”
They do not know or consider. They go about in the darkness, so that all the foundations of the earth are shaken.
I have said, “You are gods, and sons of the Most High, all of you.
However, you will die like men, and you will fall like one of the princes.”
Rise up, O God, judge the earth, because you shall inherit all the nations.

The heavens are telling the glory of God, and the firmament proclaims the work of his hands.
⌞Every day⌟ they pour forth speech, and ⌞every night⌟ they tell knowledge.
There is no speech and there are no words; their sound is inaudible.
Yet in all the world their line goes out, and their words to the end of the world. In them he has pitched a tent for the sun,
and it is like a bridegroom who comes out of his bridal chamber. It is glad like a strong man to run its course.
Its rising is from one end of the heavens and its circuit to the other end of them; and nothing is hidden from its heat.
The law of Yahweh is perfect, reviving life. The testimony of Yahweh is firm, making wise the simple.
The precepts of Yahweh are right, making the heart rejoice. The command of Yahweh is pure, enlightening the eyes.
The fear of Yahweh is pure, enduring forever. The ordinances of Yahweh are true; they are righteous altogether,
more desirable than gold, even much fine gold; and sweeter than honey, even honey in the comb.
Moreover, your servant is warned by them; in keeping them is great reward.
Who can perceive his errors? Acquit me from hidden faults.
Also, keep back your servant from arrogant sins; let them not rule over me. Then I shall be blameless, and I shall be innocent of great transgression.
Let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be acceptable in your presence, O Yahweh, my rock and my redeemer.

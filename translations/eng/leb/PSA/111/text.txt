Praise Yah! I will give thanks to Yahweh with all my heart, in the assembly of the upright and the congregation.
The works of Yahweh are great, studied by all who delight in them.
Full of splendor and majesty is his work, and his righteousness endures forever.
He has made his wonders ⌞to be remembered⌟; Yahweh is gracious and compassionate.
He gives food to those who fear him; he remembers his covenant forever.
He has declared the power of his works for his people, by giving to them the inheritance of the nations.
The works of his hands are faithfulness and justice; all his precepts are reliable.
They are sustained forever and ever, done with faithfulness and uprightness.
He has sent redemption to his people; he has commanded his covenant forever; holy and fearful is his name.
The fear of Yahweh is the beginning of wisdom; all who do them have a good understanding. His praise endures forever.

An oracle of Moab:   Because Ar is devastated in a night, Moab is destroyed; because Kir of Moab is devastated in a night, it is destroyed.
It has gone up to the house, and Dibon to the high places for weeping over Nebo, and Moab wails over Medeba. ⌞Every head is bald⌟, every beard is shaved.
They gird themselves with sackcloth in its streets; on its roofs and public squares everyone wails, going down in weeping.
And Heshbon and Elealeh cry out, their voice is heard as far as Jahaz; therefore the armed ones of Moab cry out; its soul quivers for him.
My heart cries out for Moab; its fugitives flee up to Zoar, to Eglath-shelishiyah. For at the ascent of Luhith it goes up it with weeping; for on the road of Horonaim they raise up a cry of destruction.
For the waters of Nimrim are wastelands; for the grass has withered, the vegetation has vanished, there is no greenness.
Therefore they carry the abundance it has made and their store of goods over the river of the poplars.
For a cry for help has encircled the territory of Moab, her wailing is heard as far as Eglaim, and her wailing as far as Beer Elim.
For the waters of Dimon are full of blood; but I will place added things upon Dimon: a lion for the survivors of Moab and for the remnant of the land.

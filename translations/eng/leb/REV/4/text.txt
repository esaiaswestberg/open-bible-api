After these things I looked, and behold, an open door in heaven, and the former voice that I had heard like a trumpet speaking with me was saying, “Come up here and I will show you the things which must take place after these things.”
Immediately I was in the Spirit, and behold, a throne was set in heaven, and one was seated on the throne.
And the one seated was similar in appearance to jasper and carnelian stone, and a rainbow was around the throne similar in appearance to emerald.
And around the throne were twenty-four thrones, and seated on the thrones were twenty-four elders dressed in white clothing, and on their heads were gold crowns.
And from the throne came out lightnings and sounds and thunders, and seven torches of fire were burning before the throne, which are the seven spirits of God.
And before the throne was something like a sea of glass, like crystal, and in the midst of the throne and around the throne were four living creatures full of eyes in front and in back.
And the first living creature was similar to a lion, and the second living creature was similar to an ox, and the third living creature had a face like a man’s, and the fourth living creature was similar to an eagle flying.
And the four living creatures, ⌞each one⌟ of them, had six wings apiece, full of eyes around and inside, and they do not have rest day and night, saying,   “Holy, holy, holy is the Lord God All-Powerful, the one who was and the one who is and the one who is coming!”
And whenever the living creatures give glory and honor and thanks to the one who is seated on the throne, the one who lives ⌞forever and ever⌟,
the twenty-four elders fall down before the one who is seated on the throne and worship the one who lives ⌞forever and ever⌟, and put down their crowns before the throne, saying,
“You are worthy, our Lord and God, to receive glory and honor and power, because you have created all things, and because of your will they existed and were created.”

"'You shall not go up and down as a slanderer among your people; neither shall you stand against the life of your neighbor. I am the Lord.
"'You shall not hate your brother in your heart. You shall surely rebuke your neighbor, and not bear sin because of him.
"'You shall not take vengeance, nor bear any grudge against the children of your people; but you shall love your neighbor as yourself. I am the Lord.
"'You shall keep my statutes. "'You shall not crossbreed different kinds of animals. "'you shall not sow your field with two kinds of seed; "'neither shall there come upon you a garment made of two kinds of material.

"'When you come into the land, and have planted all kinds of trees for food, then you shall count their fruit as forbidden. Three years shall they be forbidden to you. It shall not be eaten.
But in the fourth year all its fruit shall be holy, for giving praise to the Lord.
In the fifth year you shall eat its fruit, that it may yield its increase to you. I am the Lord your God.
"'You shall not eat any meat with the blood still in it; neither shall you use enchantments, nor practice sorcery.

"'You shall do no unrighteousness in judgment, in measures of length, of weight, or of quantity.
You shall have just balances, just weights, a just ephah, and a just hin. I am the Lord your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt.
You shall observe all my statutes, and all my ordinances, and do them. I am the Lord.'"

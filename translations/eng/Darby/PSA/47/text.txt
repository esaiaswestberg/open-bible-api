All ye peoples, clap your hands; shout untoGod with the voice of triumph!
For Jehovah, the Most High, is terrible, a great king over all the earth.
He subdueth the peoples under us, and the nations under our feet.
He hath chosen our inheritance for us, the excellency of Jacob whom he loved. Selah.
God is gone up amid shouting, Jehovah amid the sound of the trumpet.
Sing psalms ofGod, sing psalms; sing psalms unto our King, sing psalms!
ForGod is the King of all the earth; sing psalms with understanding.
God reigneth over the nations;God sitteth upon the throne of his holiness.
The willing-hearted of the peoples have gathered together, [with] the people of theGod of Abraham. For untoGod [belong] the shields of the earth: he is greatly exalted.

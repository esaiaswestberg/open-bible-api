Sing ye joyously untoGod our strength, shout aloud unto theGod of Jacob;
Raise a song, and sound the tambour, the pleasant harp with the lute.
Blow the trumpet at the new moon, at the set time, on our feast day:
For this is a statute for Israel, an ordinance of theGod of Jacob;
He ordained it in Joseph [for] a testimony, when he went forth over the land of Egypt, [where] I heard a language that I knew not.
I removed his shoulder from the burden; his hands were freed from the basket.
Thou calledst in trouble, and I delivered thee; I answered thee in the secret place of thunder; I proved thee at the waters of Meribah. Selah.
Hear, my people, and I will testify unto thee; O Israel, if thou wouldest hearken unto me!
There shall no strangegod be in thee, neither shalt thou worship any foreigngod.
I am Jehovah thyGod, that brought thee up out of the land of Egypt: open thy mouth wide, and I will fill it.
But my people hearkened not to my voice, and Israel would none of me.
So I gave them up unto their own hearts' stubbornness: they walked after their own counsels.
Oh that my people had hearkened unto me, that Israel had walked in my ways!
I would soon have subdued their enemies, and turned my hand against their adversaries.
The haters of Jehovah would have come cringing unto him; but their time would have been for ever.
And he would have fed them with the finest of wheat; yea, with honey out of the rock would I have satisfied thee.

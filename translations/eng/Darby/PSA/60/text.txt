OGod, thou hast cast us off, thou hast scattered us, thou hast been displeased: restore us again.
Thou hast made the earth to tremble, thou hast rent it: heal the breaches thereof; for it shaketh.
Thou hast shewn thy people hard things; thou hast made us to drink the wine of bewilderment.
Thou hast given a banner to them that fear thee, that it may be displayed because of the truth, (Selah,)
That thy beloved ones may be delivered. Save with thy right hand, and answer me.
God hath spoken in his holiness: I will exult, I will divide Shechem, and mete out the valley of Succoth.
Gilead is mine, and Manasseh is mine, and Ephraim is the strength of my head; Judah is my law-giver;
Moab is my wash-pot; upon Edom will I cast my sandal; Philistia, shout aloud because of me.
Who will bring me into the strong city? who will lead me unto Edom?
[Wilt] not thou, OGod, who didst cast us off? and didst not go forth, OGod, with our armies?
Give us help from trouble; for vain is man's deliverance.
ThroughGod we shall do valiantly; and he it is that will tread down our adversaries.

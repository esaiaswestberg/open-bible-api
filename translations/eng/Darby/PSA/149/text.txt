Hallelujah! Sing unto Jehovah a new song; [sing] his praise in the congregation of thegodly.
Let Israel rejoice in his Maker; let the sons of Zion be joyful in their King.
Let them praise his name in the dance; let them sing psalms unto him with the tambour and harp.
For Jehovah taketh pleasure in his people; he beautifieth the meek with salvation.
Let thegodly exult in glory; let them shout for joy upon their beds.
Let the high praises ofGod be in their mouth, and a two-edged sword in their hand:
To execute vengeance against the nations, [and] punishment among the peoples;
To bind their kings with chains, and their nobles with fetters of iron;
To execute upon them the judgment written. This honour have all his saints. Hallelujah!

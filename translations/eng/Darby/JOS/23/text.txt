And it came to pass a long time after that Jehovah had given rest to Israel from all their enemies round about, and Joshua had become old, advanced in age,
that Joshua called for all Israel, for their elders, and for their heads, and for their judges, and for their officers, and said unto them, I am become old, advanced in age;
and ye have seen all that Jehovah yourGod hath done to all these nations because of you. For Jehovah yourGod is he that hath fought for you.
Behold, I have divided unto you by lot for an inheritance, according to your tribes, these nations that remain, from the Jordan, as well as all the nations that I have cut off, as far as the great sea toward the sun-setting.
And Jehovah yourGod, he will expel them from before you, and dispossess them from out of your sight; and ye shall take possession of their land, as Jehovah yourGod hath said unto you.
And be ye very courageous to keep and to do all that is written in the book of the law of Moses, that ye turn not aside therefrom to the right hand or to the left;
that ye enter not among these nations, these that remain among you; and ye shall make no mention of the name of theirgods, nor cause to swear [by them], neither serve them, nor bow yourselves unto them;
but ye shall cleave unto Jehovah yourGod, as ye have done unto this day.
For Jehovah hath dispossessed from before you great and strong nations; and as to you, no man hath been able to stand before you unto this day.
One man of you chaseth a thousand; for Jehovah yourGod, he it is that fighteth for you, as he hath said unto you.
Take great heed therefore unto your souls, that ye love Jehovah yourGod.
For if ye in any wise go back, and cleave unto the residue of these nations, these that remain among you, and make marriages with them, and come in unto them and they unto you:
know for a certainty that Jehovah yourGod will no more dispossess these nations from before you, and they shall be snares and traps unto you, and scourges in your sides, and thorns in your eyes, until ye perish from off this good land which Jehovah yourGod hath given you.
And behold, I am going this day the way of all the earth; and ye know in all your heart, and in all your soul, that not one thing hath failed of all the good words that Jehovah yourGod hath spoken concerning you: all are come to pass unto you — not one thing hath failed thereof.
But it shall come to pass, that as every good word hath been fulfilled to you, that Jehovah yourGod spoke to you, so will Jehovah bring upon you every evil word, until he have destroyed you from off this good land which Jehovah yourGod hath given you;
when ye transgress the covenant of Jehovah yourGod which he commanded you, and go and serve othergods, and bow yourselves unto them, so that the anger of Jehovah shall be kindled against you, and ye shall perish quickly from off the good land which he hath given unto you.

Every one that believes that Jesus is the Christ is begotten ofGod; and every one that loves him that has begotten loves also him that is begotten of him.
Hereby know we that we love the children ofGod, when we loveGod and keep his commandments.
For this is the love ofGod, that we keep his commandments; and his commandments are not grievous.
For all that has been begotten ofGod gets the victory over the world; and this is the victory which has gotten the victory over the world, our faith.
Who is he that gets the victory over the world, but he that believes that Jesus is the Son ofGod?
This is he that came by water and blood, Jesus [the] Christ; not by water only, but by water and blood. And it is the Spirit that bears witness, for the Spirit is the truth.
For they that bear witness are three:
the Spirit, and the water, and the blood; and the three agree in one.
If we receive the witness of men, the witness ofGod is greater. For this is the witness ofGod [which] he has witnessed concerning his Son.
He that believes on the Son ofGod has the witness in himself; he that does not believeGod has made him a liar, because he has not believed in the witness whichGod has witnessed concerning his Son.
And this is the witness, thatGod has given to us eternal life; and this life is in his Son.
He that has the Son has life: he that has not the Son ofGod has not life.
These things have I written to you that ye may know that ye have eternal life who believe on the name of the Son ofGod.
And this is the boldness which we have towards him, that if we ask him anything according to his will he hears us.
And if we know that he hears us, whatsoever we ask, we know that we have the petitions which we have asked of him.
If any one see his brother sinning a sin not unto death, he shall ask, and he shall give him life, for those that do not sin unto death. There is a sin to death: I do not say of that that he should make a request.
Every unrighteousness is sin; and there is a sin not to death.
We know that every one begotten ofGod does not sin, but he that has been begotten ofGod keeps himself, and the wicked [one] does not touch him.
We know that we are ofGod, and the whole world lies in the wicked [one].
And we know that the Son ofGod has come, and has given us an understanding that we should know him that [is] true; and we are in him that [is] true, in his Son Jesus Christ. He is the trueGod and eternal life.
Children, keep yourselves from idols.

Shout for joy to the Lord, all you lands!
Serve the Lord with gladness. Come before his presence with singing.
Know that the Lord, he is God. It is he who has made us, and we are his. We are his people, and the sheep of his pasture.
Enter into his gates with thanksgiving, into his courts with praise. Give thanks to him, and bless his name.
For the Lord is good. His loving kindness endures forever, his faithfulness to all generations.

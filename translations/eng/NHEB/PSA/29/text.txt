Ascribe to the Lord, you sons of the mighty, ascribe to the Lord glory and strength.
Ascribe to the Lord the glory due to his name. Worship the Lord in holy array.
The Lord's voice is on the waters. The God of glory thunders, even the Lord on many waters.
The Lord's voice is powerful. The Lord's voice is full of majesty.
The voice of the Lord breaks the cedars. Yes, the Lord breaks in pieces the cedars of Lebanon.
He makes them also to skip like a calf; Lebanon and Sirion like a young, wild ox.
The Lord's voice strikes with flashes of lightning.
The Lord's voice shakes the wilderness. The Lord shakes the wilderness of Kadesh.
The Lord's voice makes the deer calve, and strips the forests bare. In his temple everything says, "Glory!"
The Lord sat enthroned at the Flood. Yes, the Lord sits as King forever.
The Lord will give strength to his people. The Lord will bless his people with peace.

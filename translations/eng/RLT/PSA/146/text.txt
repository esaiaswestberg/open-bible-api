Praise Yah. Praise Yhwh, O my soul.
While I live will I praise Yhwh: I will sing praises unto my God while I have any being.
Put not your trust in princes, nor in the son of man, in whom there is no help.
His breath goeth forth, he returneth to his earth; in that very day his thoughts perish.
Happy is he that hath the God of Jacob for his help, whose hope is in Yhwh his God:
Which made heaven, and earth, the sea, and all that therein is: which keepeth truth for ever:
Which executeth judgment for the oppressed: which giveth food to the hungry. Yhwh looseth the prisoners:
Yhwh openeth the eyes of the blind: Yhwh raiseth them that are bowed down: Yhwh loveth the righteous:
Yhwh preserveth the strangers; he relieveth the fatherless and widow: but the way of the wicked he turneth upside down.
Yhwh shall reign for ever, even thy God, O Zion, unto all generations. Hallelujah.

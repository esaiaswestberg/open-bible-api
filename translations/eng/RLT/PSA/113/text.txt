Praise Yah. Praise, O ye servants of Yhwh, praise the name of Yhwh.
Blessed be the name of Yhwh from this time forth and for evermore.
From the rising of the sun unto the going down of the same Yhwh's name is to be praised.
Yhwh is high above all nations, and his glory above the heavens.
Who is like unto Yhwh our God, who dwelleth on high,
Who humbleth himself to behold the things that are in heaven, and in the earth!
He raiseth up the poor out of the dust, and lifteth the needy out of the dunghill;
That he may set him with princes, even with the princes of his people.
He maketh the barren woman to keep house, and to be a joyful mother of children. Hallelujah.

Because of which, holy brothers, companions of a heavenly calling, consider the Apostle and High Priest of our affirmation, Jesus Christ,
who was faithful to him who appointed him, as also was Moses in all his house.
For this man was considered worthy of more glory than Moses, by so much as he who built it has more esteem than the house.
For every house is built by some man, but he who built all things is God.
And Moses was indeed faithful in all his house as a servant, for a testimony of the things that were going to be spoken,
but Christ as a Son over his house, whose house we are, if only we keep in possession our confidence and pride of hope, firm until the end.
Therefore, as the Holy Spirit says, Today if ye hear his voice,
do not harden your hearts as in the rebellion, according to the day of the trial in the wilderness,
where your fathers challenged me, tested me, and saw my works forty years.
Therefore I was angry with that generation, and said, They are always led astray in their heart, and they did not know my ways.
So I swore in my wrath, They will not enter into my rest.
Watch, brothers, lest there will be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief in withdrawing from the living God.
But exhort each other during each day, while it is called Today, lest any of you may be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin.
For we have become companions of the Christ, if only we keep in possession the primacy of the essence, steadfast until the end,
while it is said, Today if ye will hear his voice, do not harden your hearts as in the rebellion.
For some who heard rebelled, but not all those who came out of Egypt by Moses.
But with whom was he angry forty years? Was it not with those who sinned, whose carcasses fell in the wilderness?
And to whom did he swear were not going to enter into his rest, if not to those who were disobedient?
And we see that they were not able to enter in because of unbelief.

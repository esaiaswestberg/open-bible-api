But speak thou the things that are fitting for the sound doctrine.
Aged men are to be sober, noble, serious minded, sound in faith, in love, in perseverance.
Aged women likewise be reverent in behavior, not slanderous, not enslaved to much wine, teachers of what is good,
so that they may admonish the young women to be sensible, to love their husbands, to love their children,
to be serious-minded, pure, homemakers, good, submissive to their own husbands, so that the word of God may not be blasphemed.
Likewise exhort the younger men to be sober-minded.
Concerning all things presenting thyself a pattern of good works in the doctrine: incorruption, dignity, incorruptibility,
sound speech, irreproachable, so that the man of opposition may be ashamed, having nothing bad to say about us.
Bondmen are to be obedient to their own masters, to be well-pleasing in all things, not speaking contrary,
not pilfering, but demonstrating all good fidelity, so that they may adorn the doctrine of God our Savior in all things.
For the saving grace of God has appeared to all men,
disciplining us, so that, having denied irreverence and worldly lusts, we should live soberly and righteously and piously in the present age.
Awaiting the blessed hope and appearance of the glory of our great God and Savior Jesus Christ,
who gave himself for us, so that he might redeem us from all lawlessness, and purify to himself a special people, a zealot of good works.
These things speak and exhort and rebuke with every command. Let no man disregard thee.

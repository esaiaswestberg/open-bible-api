What was from the beginning, what we have heard, what we have seen with our eyes, what we looked upon, and our hands touched, concerning the Word of life
(and the life was made known, and we have seen, and testify, and declare to you the eternal life that was with the Father, and was made known to us),
what we have seen and heard we also declare to you, so that ye also may have fellowship with us. Even also our fellowship with the Father, and with his Son Jesus Christ.
And we write these things to you, so that our joy may be made full.
And this is the message that we have heard from him and declare to you, that God is light, and in him is no darkness at all.
If we say that we have fellowship with him and walk in the darkness, we lie, and do not the truth.
But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship with each other, and the blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanses us from every sin.
If we say that we have no sin, we lead ourselves astray, and the truth is not in us.
If we confess our sins, he is faithful and righteous so that he will forgive us our sins, and cleanse us from every unrighteousness.
If we say that we have not sinned, we make him a liar, and his word is not in us.

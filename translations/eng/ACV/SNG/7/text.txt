How beautiful are thy feet in sandals, O prince's daughter! Thy rounded thighs are like jewels, the work of the hands of a skilful workman.
Thy body is a round goblet, no mingled wine is wanting. Thy waist is a heap of wheat set about with lilies.
Thy two breasts are like two fawns that are twins of a roe.
Thy neck is like the tower of ivory. Thine eyes, the pools in Heshbon, by the gate of Bath-rabbim. Thy nose is like the tower of Lebanon which looks toward Damascus.
Thy head upon thee is like Carmel, and the hair of thy head like purple. The king is held captive in the tresses.
How fair and how pleasant thou are, O love, for delights!
This thy stature is like to a palm tree, and thy breasts to its clusters.
I said, I will climb up into the palm tree. I will take hold of the branches of it. Let thy breasts be as clusters of the vine, and the smell of thy breath like apples,
and thy mouth like the best wine, that goes down smoothly for my beloved, gliding through the lips and teeth.
I am my beloved's, and his desire is toward me.
Come, my beloved, let us go forth into the field. Let us lodge in the villages.
Let us get up early to the vineyards. Let us see whether the vine has budded, its blossom is open, the pomegranates are in flower. There I will give thee my love.
The mandrakes give forth fragrance. And at our doors are all manner of precious fruits, new and old, which I have laid up for thee, O my beloved.

I will extol thee, my God, O King, and I will bless thy name forever and ever.
Every day I will bless thee, and I will praise thy name forever and ever.
Great is Jehovah, and greatly to be praised, and his greatness is unsearchable.
One generation shall laud thy works to another, and shall declare thy mighty acts.
I will meditate on the glorious majesty of thine honor, and of thy wondrous works.
And men shall speak of the might of thy fearful acts, and I will declare thy greatness.
They shall utter the memory of thy great goodness, and shall sing of thy righteousness.
Jehovah is gracious, and merciful, slow to anger, and of great loving kindness.
Jehovah is good to all, and his tender mercies are over all his works.
All thy works shall give thanks to thee, O Jehovah, and thy sanctified shall bless thee.
They shall speak of the glory of thy kingdom, and talk of thy power,
to make known to the sons of men his mighty acts, and the glory of the majesty of his kingdom.
Thy kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and thy dominion is throughout all generations.
Jehovah upholds all who fall, and raises up all those who are bowed down.
The eyes of all wait for thee, and thou give them their food in due season.
Thou open thy hand, and satisfy the desire of every living thing.
Jehovah is righteous in all his ways, and gracious in all his works.
Jehovah is near to all those who call upon him, to all who call upon him in truth.
He will fulfill the desire of those who fear him. He also will hear their cry and will save them.
Jehovah preserves all those who love him, but he will destroy all the wicked.
My mouth shall speak the praise of Jehovah. And let all flesh bless his holy name forever and ever.

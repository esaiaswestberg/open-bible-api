Blessed are all who fear Jehovah, who walk in his ways.
For thou shall eat the labor of thy hands. Happy thou shall be, and it shall be well with thee.
Thy wife shall be as a fruitful vine in the innermost parts of thy house, thy sons like olive plants round about thy table.
Behold, thus shall the man be blessed who fears Jehovah.
Jehovah bless thee out of Zion, and see thou the good of Jerusalem all the days of thy life.
Yea, see thou thy son's sons. Peace be upon Israel.

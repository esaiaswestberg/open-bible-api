Many a time they have afflicted me from my youth up. Let Israel now say,
Many a time they have afflicted me from my youth up, yet they have not prevailed against me.
The plowers plowed upon my back. They made long their furrows.
Jehovah is righteous. He has cut apart the cords of the wicked.
Let them be put to shame and turned backward, all those who hate Zion.
Let them be as the grass upon the housetops, which withers before it grows up,
with which the reaper fills not his hand, nor he who binds sheaves, his bosom.
Neither do those who go by say, The blessing of Jehovah be upon you. We bless you in the name of Jehovah.

Give ear, O Shepherd of Israel, thou who lead Joseph like a flock. Thou who sit above the cherubim, shine forth.
Stir up thy might before Ephraim and Benjamin and Manasseh, and come to save us.
Turn us again, O God, and cause thy face to shine, and we shall be saved.
O Jehovah God of hosts, how long will thou be angry against the prayer of thy people?
Thou have fed them with the bread of tears, and given them tears to drink in large measure.
Thou make us hatred to our neighbors, and our enemies laugh among themselves.
Turn us again, O God of hosts, and cause thy face to shine, and we shall be saved.
Thou brought a vine out of Egypt. Thou drove out the nations, and planted it.
Thou prepared place before it, and it took deep root, and filled the land.
The mountains were covered with the shadow of it, and the boughs of it were like cedars of God.
It sent out its branches to the sea, and its shoots to the River.
Why have thou broken down its walls, so that all those who pass by the way pluck it?
The boar out of the wood ravages it, and the wild beasts of the field feed on it.
Turn again, we beseech thee, O God of hosts. Look down from heaven, and, behold, and visit this vine,
and the stock which thy right hand planted, and the branch that thou made strong for thyself.
It is burned with fire, it is cut down. They perish at the rebuke of thy countenance.
Let thy hand be upon the man of thy right hand, upon the son of man whom thou made strong for thyself,
so shall we not go back from thee. Revive thou us, and we will call upon thy name.
Turn us again, O Jehovah God of hosts, cause thy face to shine, and we shall be saved.

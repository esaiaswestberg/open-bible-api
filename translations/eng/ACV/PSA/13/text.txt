How long, O Jehovah? Will thou forget me forever? How long will thou hide thy face from me?
How long shall I take counsel in my soul, having sorrow in my heart all the day? How long shall my enemy be exalted over me?
Consider and answer me, O Jehovah my God. Lighten my eyes, lest I sleep the death,
lest my enemy say, I have prevailed against him, lest my adversaries rejoice when I am moved.
But I have trusted in thy loving kindness. My heart shall rejoice in thy salvation.
I will sing to Jehovah because he has dealt bountifully with me.

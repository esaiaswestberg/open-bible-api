Praise ye Jehovah, for it is good to sing praises to our God. For it is pleasant, and praise is comely.
Jehovah builds up Jerusalem. He gathers together the outcasts of Israel.
He heals the broken in heart, and binds up their wounds.
He counts the number of the stars. He calls them all by names.
Great is our Lord, and mighty in power. His understanding is infinite.
Jehovah upholds the meek. He brings the wicked down to the ground.
Sing to Jehovah with thanksgiving. Sing praises upon the harp to our God,
who covers the heavens with clouds, who prepares rain for the earth, who makes grass to grow upon the mountains.
He gives to the beast his food, and to the young ravens which cry.
He does not delight in the strength of the horse. He takes no pleasure in the legs of a man.
Jehovah takes pleasure in those who fear him, in those who hope in his loving kindness.
Praise Jehovah, O Jerusalem. Praise thy God, O Zion.
For he has strengthened the bars of thy gates. He has blessed thy sons within thee.
He makes peace in thy borders. He fills thee with the finest of the wheat.
He sends out his commandment upon earth. His word runs very swiftly.
He gives snow like wool. He scatters the hoar-frost like ashes.
He casts forth his ice like morsels. Who can stand before his cold?
He sends out his word, and melts them. He causes his wind to blow, and the waters flow.
He shows his word to Jacob, his statutes and his ordinances to Israel.
He has not dealt so with any nation. And as for his ordinances, they have not known them. Praise ye Jehovah.

When Jehovah brought back those who returned to Zion, we were like those who dream.
Then our mouth was filled with laughter, and our tongue with singing. Then they said among the nations, Jehovah has done great things for them.
Jehovah has done great things for us. We are glad.
Turn again our captivity, O Jehovah, as the streams in the South.
Those who sow in tears shall reap in joy.
He who goes forth and weeps, bearing seed for sowing, shall doubtless come again with joy, bringing his sheaves.

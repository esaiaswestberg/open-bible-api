O Jehovah, the God of my salvation, I have cried day and night before thee.
Let my prayer enter into thy presence. Incline thine ear to my cry.
For my soul is full of troubles, and my life draws near to Sheol.
I am reckoned with those who go down into the pit. I am as a man who has no help,
cast off among the dead, like the slain who lie in the grave, whom thou remember no more, and they are cut off from thy hand.
Thou have laid me in the lowest pit, in dark places, in the deeps.
Thy wrath lays hard upon me, and thou have afflicted me with all thy waves. Selah.
Thou have put my acquaintances far from me. Thou have made me an abomination to them. I am shut up, and I cannot come forth.
My eye wastes away because of affliction. I have called daily upon thee, O Jehovah, I have spread forth my hands to thee.
Will thou show wonders to the dead? Shall those who are deceased arise and praise thee? Selah.
Shall thy loving kindness be declared in the grave, or thy faithfulness in destruction?
Shall thy wonders be known in the dark, and thy righteousness in the land of forgetfulness?
But to thee, O Jehovah, I have cried, and in the morning my prayer shall come before thee.
Jehovah, why do thou cast off my soul? Why do thou hide thy face from me?
I am afflicted and ready to die from my youth up. While I suffer thy terrors I am confounded.
Thy fierce wrath has gone over me. Thy terrors have cut me off.
They came round about me like water all the day long. They encompassed me around together.
Thou have put beloved and friend far from me, and my acquaintances into darkness.

Not to us, O Jehovah, not to us, but to thy name give glory. For thy loving kindness, and for thy truth's sake.
Why should the nations say, Where is now their God?
But our God is in the heavens. He has done whatever he pleased.
Their idols are silver and gold, the work of men's hands.
They have mouths, but they speak not. They have eyes, but they see not.
They have ears, but they hear not. They have noses, but they smell not.
They have hands, but they handle not. They have feet, but they walk not, nor do they speak through their throat.
Those who make them shall be like them. Yea, everyone who trusts in them.
O Israel, trust thou in Jehovah. He is their help and their shield.
O house of Aaron, trust ye in Jehovah. He is their help and their shield.
Ye who fear Jehovah, trust in Jehovah. He is their help and their shield.
Jehovah has been mindful of us. He will bless, he will bless the house of Israel. He will bless the house of Aaron.
He will bless those who fear Jehovah, both small and great.
Jehovah increase you more and more, you and your sons.
Blessed are ye of Jehovah who made heaven and earth.
The heavens are the heavens of Jehovah, but the earth he has given to the sons of men.
The dead do not praise Jehovah, nor any who go down into silence,
but we will bless Jehovah from this time forth and for evermore. Praise ye Jehovah.

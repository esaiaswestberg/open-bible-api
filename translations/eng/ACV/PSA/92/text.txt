It is a good thing to give thanks to Jehovah, and to sing praises to thy name, O Most High,
to show forth thy loving kindness in the morning, and thy faithfulness every night,
with an instrument of ten strings, and with the psaltery, with a solemn sound upon the harp.
For thou, Jehovah, have made me glad through thy work. I will triumph in the works of thy hands.
How great are thy works, O Jehovah! Thy thoughts are very deep.
A brutish man knows not, nor does a fool understand this.
When the wicked spring as the grass, and when all the workers of iniquity flourish, it is that they shall be destroyed forever,
but thou, O Jehovah, are on high for evermore.
For, lo, thine enemies, O Jehovah, for, lo, thine enemies shall perish. All the workers of iniquity shall be scattered.
But thou have exalted my horn like the wild ox's. I am anointed with fresh oil,
and my eye has seen my enemies. My ears have heard of the evildoers who rise up against me.
A righteous man shall flourish like the palm tree. He shall grow like a cedar in Lebanon.
Men who are planted in the house of Jehovah shall flourish in the courts of our God.
They shall still bring forth fruit in old age. They shall be full of sap and green
to show that Jehovah is upright. He is my rock, and there is no unrighteousness in him.

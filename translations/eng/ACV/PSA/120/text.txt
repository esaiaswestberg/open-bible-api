In my distress I cried to Jehovah, and he answered me.
Deliver my soul, O Jehovah, from lying lips, from a deceitful tongue.
What shall be given to thee, and what shall be done more to thee, thou deceitful tongue?
Sharp arrows of the mighty, with coals of juniper.
Woe is me, that I sojourn in Meshech, that I dwell among the tents of Kedar!
My soul has long had her dwelling with him who hates peace.
I am for peace, but when I speak, they are for war.

We give thanks to thee, O God. We give thanks, for thy name is near. Men tell of thy wondrous works.
When I shall find the set time, I will judge uprightly;
when the earth and all the inhabitants thereof are dissolved. I have set up the pillars of it. Selah.
I said to the arrogant, Deal not arrogantly, and to the wicked, Lift not up the horn.
Lift not up your horn on high. Speak not with a stiff neck.
For neither from the east, nor from the west, nor yet from the south, comes lifting up.
But God is the judge. He put one down, and lifts another up.
For in the hand of Jehovah there is a cup, and the wine foams. It is full of mixture, and he pours out of the same, surely to the dregs of it. All the wicked of the earth shall drain them, and drink them.
But I will declare forever. I will sing praises to the God of Jacob.
All the horns of the wicked I will also cut off, but the horns of a righteous man shall be lifted up.

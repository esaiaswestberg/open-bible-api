Jehovah, how my adversaries are increased! Many are those who rise up against me.
Many there are who say of my soul, There is no help for him in God. Selah.
But thou, O Jehovah, are a shield about me, my glory and he who lifts up of my head.
I cry to Jehovah with my voice, and he answers me out of his holy hill. Selah.
I laid down and slept. I awoke, for Jehovah sustains me.
I will not be afraid of ten thousands of the people who have set themselves against me round about.
Arise, O Jehovah. Save me, O my God. For thou have smitten all my enemies upon the cheek bone. Thou have broken the teeth of the wicked.
Salvation belongs to Jehovah. Thy blessing be upon thy people. Selah.

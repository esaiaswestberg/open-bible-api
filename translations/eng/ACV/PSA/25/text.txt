To thee, O Jehovah, do I lift up my soul.
O my God, in thee I have trusted. Let me not be put to shame. Let not my enemies triumph over me.
Yea, none who wait for thee shall be put to shame. They shall be put to shame who deal treacherously without cause.
Show me thy ways, O Jehovah. Teach me thy paths.
Guide me in thy truth, and teach me. For thou are the God of my salvation. For thee do I wait all the day.
Remember, O Jehovah, thy tender mercies and thy loving kindness. For they have been ever of old.
Remember not the sins of my youth, nor my transgressions. According to thy loving kindness remember thou me, for thy goodness' sake, O Jehovah.
Good and upright is Jehovah. Therefore he will instruct sinners in the way.
The meek he will guide in justice, and the meek he will teach his way.
All the paths of Jehovah are loving kindness and truth to such as keep his covenant and his testimonies.
For thy name's sake, O Jehovah, pardon my iniquity, for it is great.
What man is he who fears Jehovah? Him he shall instruct in the way that he shall choose.
His soul shall dwell at ease, and his seed shall inherit the land.
The friendship of Jehovah is with those who fear him, and he will show them his covenant.
My eyes are ever toward Jehovah, for he will pluck my feet out of the net.
Turn thee to me, and have mercy upon me, for I am desolate and afflicted.
The troubles of my heart are enlarged. O bring thou me out of my distresses.
Consider my affliction and my travail, and forgive all my sins.
Consider my enemies, for they are many. And they hate me with cruel hatred.
O keep my soul, and deliver me. Let me not be put to shame, for I take refuge in thee.
Let integrity and uprightness preserve me, for I wait for thee.
Redeem Israel, O God, out of all of his troubles.

Blessed is he who considers a poor man. Jehovah will deliver him in the day of evil.
Jehovah will preserve him, and keep him alive, and he shall be blessed upon the earth. And thou do not deliver him to the will of his enemies.
Jehovah will support him upon the bed of languishing. Thou will make all his bed in his sickness.
I said, O Jehovah, have mercy upon me. Heal my soul, for I have sinned against thee.
My enemies speak evil against me, saying, When will he die, and his name perish?
And if he comes to see me, he speaks falsehood. His heart gathers iniquity to itself. When he goes abroad, he tells it.
All who hate me whisper together against me. Against me they devise my hurt.
An evil disease, they say, clings firm to him. And now that he lies he shall rise up no more.
Yea, my own familiar friend, in whom I trusted, who ate of my bread, has lifted up his heel against me.
But thou, O Jehovah, have mercy upon me, and raise me up that I may requite them.
By this I know that thou delight in me, because my enemy does not triumph over me.
And as for me, thou uphold me in my integrity, and set me before thy face forever.
Blessed be Jehovah, the God of Israel, from everlasting and to everlasting. Truly, and Truly.

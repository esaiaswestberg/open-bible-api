Jehovah, who shall sojourn in thy tabernacle? Who shall dwell in thy holy hill?
He who walks uprightly, and works righteousness, and speaks truth in his heart,
he who does no slander with his tongue, nor does evil to his friend, nor takes up a reproach against his neighbor,
in whose eyes a reprobate is despised, but who honors those who fear Jehovah, he that swears to his own hurt, and changes not,
he who puts not his money out to interest, nor takes a bribe against the innocent. He who does these things shall never be moved.

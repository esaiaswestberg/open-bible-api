Great is Jehovah, and greatly to be praised in the city of our God, in his holy mountain.
Beautiful in elevation, the joy of the whole earth, is mount Zion, on the sides of the north, the city of the great King.
God has made himself known in her palaces for a refuge.
For, lo, the kings assembled themselves. They passed by together.
They saw it, then were they amazed. They were dismayed, they hastened away.
Trembling took hold of them there, pain, as of a woman in travail.
With the east wind thou break the ships of Tarshish.
As we have heard, so we have seen in the city of Jehovah of hosts, in the city of our God, God will establish it forever. Selah.
We have thought on thy loving kindness, O God, in the midst of thy temple.
As is thy name, O God, so is thy praise to the ends of the earth. Thy right hand is full of righteousness.
Let mount Zion be glad. Let the daughters of Judah rejoice because of thy judgments.
Walk about Zion, and go round about her. Number the towers of it,
mark ye well her bulwarks, consider her palaces, that ye may tell it to the generation following.
For this God is our God forever and ever. He will be our guide even to death.

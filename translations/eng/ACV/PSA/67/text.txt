God be merciful to us, and bless us, and cause his face to shine upon us (Selah),
that thy way may be known upon earth, thy salvation among all nations.
Let the peoples praise thee, O God. Let all the peoples praise thee.
O let the nations be glad and sing for joy. For thou will judge the peoples with equity, and govern the nations upon earth. Selah.
Let the peoples praise thee, O God. Let all the peoples praise thee.
The earth has yielded its increase. God, even our own God, will bless us.
God will bless us, and all the ends of the earth shall fear him.

Praise ye Jehovah. Praise Jehovah, O my soul.
While I live I will praise Jehovah. I will sing praises to my God while I have any being.
Put not your trust in rulers, nor in the son of man, in whom there is no help.
His breath goes forth, he returns to his earth. In that very day his thoughts perish.
Happy is he who has the God of Jacob for his help, whose hope is in Jehovah his God,
who made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that is in them, who keeps truth forever,
who executes justice for the oppressed, who gives food to the hungry. Jehovah releases the prisoners.
Jehovah opens the eyes of the blind. Jehovah raises up those who are bowed down. Jehovah loves the righteous.
Jehovah preserves the sojourners. He upholds the fatherless and widow. But the way of the wicked he turns upside down.
Jehovah will reign forever, thy God, O Zion, to all generations. Praise ye Jehovah.

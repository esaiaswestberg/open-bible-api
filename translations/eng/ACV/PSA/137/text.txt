By the rivers of Babylon, there we sat down, yea, we wept when we remembered Zion.
Upon the willows in the midst of it we hung up our harps.
For there those who led us captive required of us songs, and those who wasted us, mirth, saying, Sing for us one of the songs of Zion.
How shall we sing Jehovah's song in a foreign land?
If I forget thee, O Jerusalem, let my right hand forget.
Let my tongue cling to the roof of my mouth, if I do not remember thee, if I do not prefer Jerusalem above my chief joy.
Remember, O Jehovah, the day of Jerusalem against the sons of Edom, who said, Raze it, raze it, even to the foundation thereof.
O daughter of Babylon, who is to be destroyed, happy shall he be who rewards thee as thou have served us.
Happy shall he be who takes and dashes thy little ones against the rock.

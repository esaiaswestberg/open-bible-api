To thee do I lift up my eyes, O thou who sit in the heavens.
Behold, as the eyes of servants to the hand of their master, as the eyes of a maid to the hand of her mistress, so our eyes are to Jehovah our God, until he has mercy upon us.
Have mercy upon us, O Jehovah, have mercy upon us, for we are exceedingly filled with contempt.
Our soul is exceedingly filled with the scoffing of those who are at ease, and with the contempt of the proud.

And in that day thou shall say, I will give thanks to thee, O Jehovah, for though thou were angry with me. Thine anger is turned away and thou comfort me.
Behold, God is my salvation. I will trust, and will not be afraid, for Jehovah, even Jehovah, is my strength and song, and he has become my salvation.
Therefore with joy ye shall draw water out of the wells of salvation.
And in that day ye shall say, Give thanks to Jehovah. Call upon his name. Declare his doings among the peoples. Make mention that his name is exalted.
Sing to Jehovah, for he has done excellent things. Let this be known in all the earth.
Cry aloud and shout, thou inhabitant of Zion, for great in the midst of thee is the Holy One of Israel.

The word of Jehovah that came to Jeremiah the prophet concerning the Philistines, before Pharaoh smote Gaza.
Thus says Jehovah: Behold, waters rise up out of the north, and shall become an overflowing stream, and shall overflow the land and all that is therein, the city and those who dwell therein. And the men shall cry, and all the inhabitants of the land shall wail
at the noise of the stamping of the hoofs of his strong ones, at the rushing of his chariots, at the rumbling of his wheels. The fathers do not look back to their sons for feebleness of hands,
because of the day that comes to destroy all the Philistines, to cut off from Tyre and Sidon every helper who remains. For Jehovah will destroy the Philistines, the remnant of the isle of Caphtor.
Baldness has come upon Gaza. Ashkelon is brought to naught, the remnant of their valley. How long will thou cut thyself?
O thou sword of Jehovah, how long will it be ere thou be quiet? Put up thyself into thy scabbard. Rest, and be still.
How can thou be quiet, since Jehovah has given thee a charge against Ashkelon, and against the sea-shore. He has appointed it there.

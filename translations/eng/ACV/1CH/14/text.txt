And Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, and cedar trees, and masons, and carpenters, to build for him a house.
And David perceived that Jehovah had established him king over Israel, for his kingdom was exalted on high for his people Israel's sake.
And David took more wives at Jerusalem, and David begot more sons and daughters.
And these are the names of the children whom he had in Jerusalem: Shammua, and Shobab, Nathan, and Solomon,
and Ibhar, and Elishua, and Elpelet,
and Nogah, and Nepheg, and Japhia,
and Elishama, and Beeliada, and Eliphelet.
And when the Philistines heard that David was anointed king over all Israel, all the Philistines went up to seek David. And David heard of it, and went out against them.
Now the Philistines had come and made a raid in the valley of Rephaim.
And David inquired of God, saying, Shall I go up against the Philistines? And will thou deliver them into my hand? And Jehovah said to him, Go up, for I will deliver them into thy hand.
So they came up to Baal-perazim, and David smote them there. And David said, God has broken my enemies by my hand like the breach of waters. Therefore they called the name of that place Baal-perazim.
And they left their gods there. And David gave commandment, and they were burned with fire.
And the Philistines yet again made a raid in the valley.
And David inquired again of God. And God said to him, Thou shall not go up after them. Turn away from them, and come upon them opposite the mulberry trees.
And it shall be, when thou hear the sound of marching in the tops of the mulberry trees, that then thou shall go out to battle. For God has gone out before thee to smite the army of the Philistines.
And David did as God commanded him, and they smote the army of the Philistines from Gibeon even to Gezer.
And the fame of David went out into all lands. And Jehovah brought the fear of him upon all nations.

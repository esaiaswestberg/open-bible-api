Finally, brothers, pray about us, so that the word of the Lord may run and be glorified, just as also with you,
and that we may be delivered from aberrant and wicked men, for the faith is not of all men.
But the Lord is faithful, who will establish you and will keep you from evil.
And we are persuaded in the Lord toward you, that what we command you, ye both are doing and will do.
And may the Lord direct your hearts for the love of God, and for the steadfastness of the Christ.
Now we command you, brothers, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, for you to withdraw from every brother who walks disorderly and not according to the tradition, which they received from us.
For ye yourselves know how it is necessary to imitate us. Because we did not act disorderly among you,
nor did we eat bread gratis from any man, but in labor and toil, working night and day in order not to burden any of you.
Not because we have no right, but that we might give ourselves an example to you, in order to imitate us.
For even when we were with you we commanded you this, that if any man will not work, neither let him eat.
For we hear of some who walk among you disorderly, not working at all, but being busybodies.
Now to such men we command and exhort by our Lord Jesus Christ, that, working with quietness, they should eat their own bread.
But ye, brothers, do not become weary doing good.
And if any man does not obey our word by this letter, note that man, and do not associate with him, so that he may be ashamed.
And yet do not regard him as an enemy, but admonish him as a brother.
Now may the Lord of peace himself give you peace through everything in every way. The Lord is with all of you.
The salutation of Paul by my hand, which is a mark in every letter I write this way.
The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ is with all of you. Truly.

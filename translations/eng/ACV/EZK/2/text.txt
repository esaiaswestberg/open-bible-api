And he said to me, Son of man, stand upon thy feet, and I will speak with thee.
And the Spirit entered into me when he spoke to me, and set me upon my feet. And I heard him who spoke to me.
And he said to me, Son of man, I send thee to the sons of Israel, to nations that are rebellious, which have rebelled against me. They and their fathers have transgressed against me even to this very day.
And the sons are impudent and stiff hearted. I send thee to them, and thou shall say to them, Thus says the lord Jehovah.
And they, whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear (for they are a rebellious house), yet shall know that there has been a prophet among them.
And thou, son of man, be not afraid of them, nor be afraid of their words, though briers and thorns are with thee, and thou dwell among scorpions. Be not afraid of their words, nor be dismayed at their looks, though they are a rebellious house.
And thou shall speak my words to them, whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear, for they are most rebellious.
But thou, son of man, hear what I say to thee. Be not thou rebellious like that rebellious house. Open thy mouth, and eat that which I give thee.
And when I looked, behold, a hand was put forth to me, and, lo, a roll of a book was in it,
And he spread it before me, and it was written inside and outside. And there were written in it lamentations and mourning and woe.

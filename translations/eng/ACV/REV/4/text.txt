After these things I looked, and behold, a door opened in heaven, and the first voice that I heard like a trumpet, speaking with me, saying, Come up here, and I will show thee what must happen after these things.
And straightaway I became in spirit. And behold, a throne was set in heaven, and him sitting upon the throne
similar in appearance to a jasper and a sardius stone. And a rainbow was around the throne, like an emerald in appearance.
And around the throne were twenty-four thrones, and upon the thrones were sitting twenty-four elders clothed in white garments, and golden crowns upon their heads.
And out of the throne proceeds lightnings and voices and thunders. And seven lamps of fire burned before his throne, which are the seven Spirits of God.
And before the throne was like a glassy sea similar to crystal. And in the midst of the throne, and all around the throne, were four living creatures containing eyes in front and back.
And the first living creature was similar to a lion, and the second living creature was similar to a young bull, and the third living creature having a face like a man, and the fourth living creature was similar to a flying eagle.
And the four living creatures, one by one, each having six wings, are full of eyes around and inside. And they have no cessation day and night, saying, Holy, holy, holy, Lord, the Almighty God, he was, and who is, and who is coming.
And whenever the living creatures give glory and honor and thanks to him who sits on the throne, he who lives into the ages of the ages,
the twenty-four elders would fall down before him who sits on the throne, and would worship him who lives into the ages of the ages, and would cast their crowns before the throne, saying,
Thou are worthy, our Lord and God, the Holy, to take the glory and the honor and the power, because thou created all things, and because by thy will they are, and were created.

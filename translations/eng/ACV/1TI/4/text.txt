But the Spirit says expressly that in latter times some will depart from the faith, giving heed to deceitful spirits and doctrines of demons,
speaking lies in hypocrisy, their own conscience having been seared with a hot iron,
forbidding to marry, to abstain from foods, which God created for partaking with thankfulness by those who believe and know the truth.
Because every creation of God is good, and nothing rejected that is received with thankfulness,
for it is sanctified through the word of God and prayer.
Laying these things down to the brothers, thou will be a good helper of Jesus Christ, reared up in the words of the faith, and of the good doctrine that thou have followed.
But reject the profane and old wives' fables, and exercise thyself to piety.
For bodily exercise is profitable for a little, but piety is profitable for all things, having promise of the present life, and of that which is coming.
Faithful is the saying, and worthy of all acceptance.
For we both labor and are reproached for this, because we have hoped in the living God, who is the Savior of all men, especially of the faithful.
These things command and teach.
Let no man disparage thy youth, but become an example of the faithful, in word, in conduct, in love, in spirit, in faith, in purity.
Until I come, give attention to reading, to exhortation, to teaching.
Do not neglect the gift in thee, which was given thee by prophecy with the laying on of the hands of the eldership.
Think on these things-exist within these things-so that thy progress may be visible among all.
Hold firm to thyself and to the doctrine. Continue in them, for in doing this thou will save both thyself and those who hear thee.

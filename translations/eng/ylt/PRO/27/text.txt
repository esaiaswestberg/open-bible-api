Let another praise thee, and not thine own mouth, A stranger, and not thine own lips.
A stone <FI>is<Fi> heavy, and the sand <FI>is<Fi> heavy, And the anger of a fool Is heavier than they both.
Fury <FI>is<Fi> fierce, and anger <FI>is<Fi> overflowing, And who standeth before jealousy?
Better <FI>is<Fi> open reproof than hidden love.
Faithful are the wounds of a lover, And abundant the kisses of an enemy.
A satiated soul treadeth down a honeycomb, And <FI>to<Fi> a hungry soul every bitter thing <FI>is<Fi> sweet.
As a bird wandering from her nest, So <FI>is<Fi> a man wandering from his place.
Ointment and perfume rejoice the heart, And the sweetness of one's friend--from counsel of the soul.
Thine own friend, and the friend of thy father, forsake not, And the house of thy brother enter not In a day of thy calamity, Better <FI>is<Fi> a near neighbour than a brother afar off.
Be wise, my son, and rejoice my heart. And I return my reproacher a word.

A continual dropping in a day of rain, And a woman of contentions are alike,
Whoso is hiding her hath hidden the wind, And the ointment of his right hand calleth out.
Iron by iron is sharpened, And a man sharpens the face of his friend.
The keeper of a fig-tree eateth its fruit, And the preserver of his master is honoured.
As <FI>in<Fi> water the face <FI>is<Fi> to face, So the heart of man to man.
Sheol and destruction are not satisfied, And the eyes of man are not satisfied.
A refining pot <FI>is<Fi> for silver, and a furnace for gold, And a man according to his praise.
If thou dost beat the foolish in a mortar, Among washed things--with a pestle, His folly turneth not aside from off him.
Know well the face of thy flock, Set thy heart to the droves,
For riches <FI>are<Fi> not to the age, Nor a crown to generation and generation.
Revealed was the hay, and seen the tender grass, And gathered the herbs of mountains.
Lambs <FI>are<Fi> for thy clothing, And the price of the field <FI>are<Fi> he-goats,
And a sufficiency of goats' milk <FI>is<Fi> for thy bread, For bread to thy house, and life to thy damsels!

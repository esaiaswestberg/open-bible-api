These <FI>are<Fi> births of Noah: Noah <FI>is<Fi> a righteous man; perfect he hath been among his generations; with God hath Noah walked habitually.
And Noah begetteth three sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth.
And the earth is corrupt before God, and the earth is filled <FI>with<Fi> violence.

and this <FI>is<Fi> that which thou dost with it: three hundred cubits <FI>is<Fi> the length of the ark, fifty cubits its breadth, and thirty cubits its height;
a window dost thou make for the ark, and unto a cubit thou dost restrain it from above; and the opening of the ark thou dost put in its side, --lower, second, and third <FI>stories<Fi> dost thou make it.
`And I, lo, I am bringing in the deluge of waters on the earth to destroy all flesh, in which <FI>is<Fi> a living spirit, from under the heavens; all that <FI>is<Fi> in the earth doth expire.

and of all that liveth, of all flesh, two of every <FI>sort<Fi> thou dost bring in unto the ark, to keep alive with thee; male and female are they.
Of the fowl after its kind, and of the cattle after their kind, of every creeping thing of the ground after its kind, two of every <FI>sort<Fi> they come in unto thee, to keep alive.
`And thou, take to thyself of all food that is eaten; and thou hast gathered unto thyself, and it hath been to thee and to them for food.'

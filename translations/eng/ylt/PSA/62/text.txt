To the Overseer, for Jeduthun. --A Psalm of David. Only--toward God <FI>is<Fi> my soul silent, From Him <FI>is<Fi> my salvation.
Only--He <FI>is<Fi> my rock, and my salvation, My tower, I am not much moved.
Till when do ye devise mischief against a man? Ye are destroyed all of you, As a wall inclined, a hedge that is cast down.
Only--from his excellency They have consulted to drive away, They enjoy a lie, with their mouth they bless, And with their heart revile. Selah.
Only--for God, be silent, O my soul, For from Him <FI>is<Fi> my hope.
Only--He <FI>is<Fi> my rock and my salvation, My tower, I am not moved.
On God <FI>is<Fi> my salvation, and my honour, The rock of my strength, my refuge <FI>is<Fi> in God.
Trust in Him at all times, O people, Pour forth before Him your heart, God <FI>is<Fi> a refuge for us. Selah.
Only--vanity <FI>are<Fi> the low, a lie the high. In balances to go up they than vanity <FI>are<Fi> lighter.
Trust not in oppression, And in robbery become not vain, Wealth--when it increaseth--set not the heart.
Once hath God spoken, twice I heard this, That `strength <FI>is<Fi> with God.'
And with Thee, O Lord, <FI>is<Fi> kindness, For Thou dost recompense to each, According to his work!

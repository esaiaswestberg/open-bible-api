Sing to Jehovah a new song, Sing to Jehovah all the earth.
Sing to Jehovah, bless His name, Proclaim from day to day His salvation.
Declare among nations His honour, Among all the peoples His wonders.
For great <FI>is<Fi> Jehovah, and praised greatly, Fearful He <FI>is<Fi> over all gods.
For all the gods of the peoples <FI>are<Fi> nought, And Jehovah made the heavens.
Honour and majesty <FI>are<Fi> before Him, Strength and beauty in His sanctuary.
Ascribe to Jehovah, O families of the peoples, Ascribe to Jehovah honour and strength.
Ascribe to Jehovah the honour of His name, Lift up a present and come in to His courts.
Bow yourselves to Jehovah, In the honour of holiness, Be afraid of His presence, all the earth.
Say among nations, `Jehovah hath reigned, Also--established is the world, unmoved, He judgeth the peoples in uprightness.'
The heavens joy, and the earth is joyful, The sea and its fulness roar.
The field exulteth, and all that <FI>is<Fi> in it, Then sing do all trees of the forest,
Before Jehovah, for He hath come, For He hath come to judge the earth. He judgeth the world in righteousness, And the peoples in His faithfulness!

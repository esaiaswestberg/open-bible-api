A Song of the Ascents. Unto Thee I have lifted up mine eyes, O dweller in the heavens.
Lo, as eyes of men-servants <FI>Are<Fi> unto the hand of their masters, As eyes of a maid-servant <FI>Are<Fi> unto the hand of her mistress, So <FI>are<Fi> our eyes unto Jehovah our God, Till that He doth favour us.
Favour us, O Jehovah, favour us, For greatly have we been filled with contempt,
Greatly hath our soul been filled With the scorning of the easy ones, With the contempt of the arrogant!

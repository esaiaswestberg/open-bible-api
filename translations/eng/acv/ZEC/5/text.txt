Then again I lifted up my eyes, and saw, and, behold, a flying roll.
And he said to me, What do thou see? And I answered, I see a flying roll. The length of it is twenty cubits, and the breadth of it ten cubits.
Then he said to me, This is the curse that goes forth over the face of the whole land. For everyone who steals shall be cut off on the one side according to it, and everyone who swears shall be cut off on the other side according to it.
I will cause it to go forth, says Jehovah of hosts, and it shall enter into the house of the thief, and into the house of him who swears falsely by my name. And it shall abide in the midst of his house, and shall consume it, with the timber thereof and the stones thereof.
Then the agent who talked with me went forth, and said to me, Lift up now thine eyes, and see what this is that goes forth.
And I said, What is it? And he said, This is the ephah that goes forth. He said moreover, This is their appearance in all the land
(and, behold, a talent of lead was lifted up), and this is a woman sitting in the midst of the ephah.
And he said, This is Wickedness. And he cast her down into the midst of the ephah, and he cast the weight of lead upon the mouth of it.
Then I lifted up my eyes, and looked. And, behold, there came forth two women, and the wind was in their wings. Now they had wings like the wings of a stork, and they lifted up the ephah between earth and heaven.
Then I said to the agent who talked with me, Where do these carry the ephah?
And he said to me, To build her a house in the land of Shinar. And when it is prepared, she shall be set there in her own place.

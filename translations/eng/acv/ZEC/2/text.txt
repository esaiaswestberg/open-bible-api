Then I said, Where do thou go? And he said to me, To measure Jerusalem. To see what is the breadth of it, and what is the length of it.

Ho Zion, escape, thou who dwell with the daughter of Babylon.
For thus says Jehovah of hosts: After glory he has sent me to the nations which plundered you. For he who touches you touches the apple of his eye.
For, behold, I will shake my hand over them, and they shall be a spoil to those who served them. And ye shall know that Jehovah of hosts has sent me.
Sing and rejoice, O daughter of Zion, for, lo, I come, and I will dwell in the midst of thee, says Jehovah.
And many nations shall join themselves to Jehovah in that day, and shall be my people, and I will dwell in the midst of thee. And thou shall know that Jehovah of hosts has sent me to thee.
And Jehovah shall inherit Judah as his portion in the holy land, and shall yet choose Jerusalem.
Be silent, all flesh, before Jehovah, for he has arisen out of his holy habitation.

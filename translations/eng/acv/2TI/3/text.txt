But know this, that in the last days perilous times will come.
For men will be lovers of self, lovers of money, boasters, arrogant, blasphemous, disobedient to parents, ungrateful, impious,
devoid of natural affection, irreconcilable, slanderous, without self-control, savage, no lovers of good,
traitors, reckless, beclouded, lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God,
having a form of piety, but repudiating the power of it. Now turn away from these men,
for from these are those who creep into houses, and take captive petty women laden with sins, being led away by various impulses,
ever learning and never able to come to knowledge of truth.
And by which way Jannes and Jambres opposed Moses, so also do these oppose the truth. Men corrupted in mind, worthless about the faith.
But they will not advance in much more, for their folly will be evident to all men, as also that of those men came to be.
But thou have closely followed my doctrine, conduct, purpose, faith, longsuffering, love, perseverance,
persecutions, sufferings, such as happened to me at Antioch, at Iconium, at Lystra. I endured such persecutions, and the Lord rescued me out of them all.
And also all those who want to live devoutly in Christ Jesus will be persecuted.
But evil men and impostors will go forward to worse, leading astray and being led astray.
But continue thou in what thou learned and were convinced of, knowing from whom thou learned them.
And that from a babe thou have known the sacred writings, which are able to make thee wise for salvation through faith in Christ Jesus.
Every scripture is inspired by God and useful for instruction, for reproof, for correction, for discipline in righteousness,
so that the man of God may be qualified, having been completed for every good work.

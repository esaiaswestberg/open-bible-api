From where are wars and fightings among you? Is it not from here: from your pleasures warring in your body-parts?
Ye desire and do not have, so ye murder. And ye envy and cannot obtain, so ye fight and make war. Ye do not have, because ye do not ask.
Ye ask, and do not receive, because ye ask wrongly, so that ye may spend on your pleasures.
Ye adulterers and adulteresses, know ye not that the friendship of the world is hatred of God? Whoever therefore wants to be a friend of the world becomes an enemy of God.
Or think ye that the scripture says vainly, The Spirit that he caused to dwell in us yearns with jealousy?
But he gives greater grace. Therefore it says, God is opposed to the arrogant, but gives grace to the lowly.
Be subordinate therefore to God, but resist the devil and he will flee from you.
Approach God and he will approach you. Cleanse the hands, ye sinners, and purify the hearts, ye double-minded.
Be ye sorrowful, and mourn, and weep. Let your laughter be turned into mourning, and your joy into a downcast look.
Be ye made lower in the sight of the Lord, and he will lift you up.
Speak not against each other, brothers. He who speaks against a brother and judges his brother, speaks against law and judges law. But if thou judge law, thou are not a doer of law, but a judge.

Go now, men who say, Today and tomorrow we will go into this city, and will operate one year there, and will engage in trade and will get gain-
men who know not of the morrow. For what is your life? For it will be a vapor that appears for a little while, and then also vanishes away-
in place of your saying, If the Lord should will, then we will live and do this or that.
But now ye boast in your arrogance. All such boasting is evil.
He therefore who knows to do good, and is not doing it, to him it is sin.

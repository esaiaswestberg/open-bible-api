And Jehoshaphat the king of Judah returned to his house in peace to Jerusalem.
And Jehu the son of Hanani the seer went out to meet him, and said to king Jehoshaphat, Should thou help the wicked, and love those who hate Jehovah? For this thing wrath is upon thee from before Jehovah.
Nevertheless there are good things found in thee, in that thou have put away the Asheroth out of the land, and have set thy heart to seek God.
And Jehoshaphat dwelt at Jerusalem. And he went out again among the people from Beersheba to the hill-country of Ephraim, and brought them back to Jehovah, the God of their fathers.
And he set judges in the land throughout all the fortified cities of Judah, city by city,
and said to the judges, Consider what ye do. For ye judge not for man, but for Jehovah, and he is with you in the judgment.
Now therefore let the fear of Jehovah be upon you. Take heed and do it. For there is no iniquity with Jehovah our God, nor respect of persons, nor taking of bribes.
Moreover in Jerusalem Jehoshaphat set from the Levites and the priests, and from the heads of the fathers of Israel for the judgment of Jehovah, and for controversies. And they returned to Jerusalem.
And he charged them, saying, Thus ye shall do in the fear of Jehovah, faithfully, and with a perfect heart.
And whenever any controversy shall come to you from your brothers who dwell in their cities, between blood and blood, between law and commandment, statutes and ordinances, ye shall warn them, that they not be guilty towards Jehovah, and so wrath come upon you and upon your brothers. Do this, and ye shall not be guilty.
And, behold, Amariah the chief priest is over you in all matters of Jehovah, and Zebadiah the son of Ishmael, the ruler of the house of Judah, in all the king's matters. The Levites shall also be officers before you. Deal courageously, and Jehovah be with the good.

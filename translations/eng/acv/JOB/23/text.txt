Then Job answered and said,
Even today my complaint is rebellious. My stroke is heavier than my groaning.
O that I knew where I might find him, that I might come even to his seat!
I would set my case in order before him, and fill my mouth with arguments.
I would know the words which he would answer me, and understand what he would say to me.
Would he contend with me in the greatness of his power? No, but he would give heed to me.
There the upright might reason with him. So I should be delivered forever from my judge.
Behold, I go forward, but he is not there, and backward, but I cannot perceive him,
on the left hand, when he works, but I cannot behold him. He hides himself on the right hand, that I cannot see him.
But he knows the way that I take. When he has tried me, I shall come forth as gold.
My foot has held fast to his steps. I have kept his way, and not turned aside.
I have not gone back from the commandment of his lips, I have treasured up the words of his mouth more than my necessary food.
But he is in one mind, and who can turn him? And what his soul desires, even that he does.
For he performs that which is appointed for me. And many such things are with him.
Therefore I am terrified at his presence. When I consider, I am afraid of him.
For God has made my heart faint, and the Almighty has terrified me,
because I was not cut off before the darkness, nor did he cover the thick darkness from my face.

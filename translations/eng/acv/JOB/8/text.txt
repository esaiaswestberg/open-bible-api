Then Bildad the Shuhite answered, and said,
How long will thou speak these things? And how long shall the words of thy mouth be like a mighty wind?
Does God pervert justice? Or does the Almighty pervert righteousness?
If thy sons have sinned against him, and he has delivered them into the hand of their transgression,
if thou would seek diligently to God, and make thy supplication to the Almighty,
if thou were pure and upright, surely now he would awake for thee, and make the habitation of thy righteousness prosperous.
And though thy beginning was small, yet thy latter end would greatly increase.
For inquire, I pray thee, of the former age, and apply thyself to that which their fathers have searched out
(for we are but of yesterday, and know nothing, because our days upon earth are a shadow).
Shall they not teach thee, and tell thee, and utter words out of their heart?
Can the rush grow up without mire? Can a reed grow without water?
While it is yet in its greenness, and not cut down, it withers before any other herb.
So are the paths of all who forget God. And the hope of the profane man shall perish,
whose confidence shall break apart, and whose trust is a spider's web.
He shall lean upon his house, but it shall not stand. He shall hold fast thereby, but it shall not endure.
He is green before the sun, and his shoots go forth over his garden.
His roots are wrapped around the stone heap. He beholds the place of stones.
If he is destroyed from his place, then it shall deny him, saying, I have not seen thee.
Behold, this is the joy of his way, and out of the earth others shall spring.
Behold, God will not cast away a perfect man, nor will he uphold the evildoers.
He will yet fill thy mouth with laughter, and thy lips with shouting.
Those who hate thee shall be clothed with shame, and the tent of the wicked shall be no more.

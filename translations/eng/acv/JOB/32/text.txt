So these three men ceased to answer Job because he was righteous in his own eyes.
Then the anger of Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite, of the family of Ram, was kindled. His anger was kindled against Job because he justified himself rather than God.
His anger was also kindled against his three friends because they had found no answer, and yet had condemned Job.
Now Elihu had waited to speak to Job, because they were older than he.
And when Elihu saw that there was no answer in the mouth of these three men, his anger was kindled.
And Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite answered and said, I am young, and ye are very old. Therefore I held back, and dared not show you my opinion.
I said, Days should speak, and multitude of years should teach wisdom.
But there is a spirit in man, and the breath of the Almighty gives them understanding.
It is not the great who are wise, nor the aged who understand justice.
Therefore I said, Hearken to me, I also will show my opinion.
Behold, I waited for your words, I listened for your reasonings, while ye searched out what to say.
Yea, I attended to you. And, behold, there was none who convinced Job, or who answered his words among you.
Beware lest ye say, We have found wisdom. God may vanquish him, not man.
For he has not directed his words against me. Neither will I answer him with your speeches.
They are amazed, they answer no more. They have not a word to say.
And shall I wait because they do not speak, because they stand still, and answer no more?
I also will answer my part. I also will show my opinion,
for I am full of words. The spirit within me compels me.
Behold, my breast is as wine which has no vent. Like new wine-skins it is ready to burst.
I will speak that I may be refreshed. I will open my lips and answer.
Let me not, I pray you, respect any man's person. Neither will I give flattering titles to any man.
For I know not to give flattering titles, else my maker would soon take me away.

For every high priest taken from men is appointed for men in things toward God, so that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins.
Who can be gentle to those who are ignorant and led astray, since he himself is also encompassed with weakness.
And because of this he is obligated, as for the people, so also for himself, to offer for sins.
And not any man takes the honor to himself, but being called by God, just as also Aaron.
So also Christ did not glorify himself to become a high priest, but it was he who said to him, Thou are my Son, today I have begotten thee.
(And just as he says in another, Thou are a priest into the age according to the order of Melchizedek.)
Who, in the days of his flesh, having offered up both prayers and supplications with strong shouting and tears to him who was able to save him from death, and who was heard because of his reverence,
although being a Son, he learned obedience from the things that he suffered.
And having been fully perfected, he became the source of eternal salvation to all those who obey him,
having been designated by God a high priest according to the order of Melchizedek.
About whom, much subject matter from us is also difficult to explain, since ye have become sluggish in hearing.
For also men who ought to be teachers because of the time, ye have need again for some man to teach you the rudiments of the beginning of the oracles of God, and have become men who have need of milk, and not of solid food.
For every man partaking of milk is unskilled in the word of righteousness, for he is childlike.
But solid food is for mature men, those having their sensibilities trained through practice for the discernment of both good and evil.

Therefore, no longer covering over it, we preferred to be left behind in Athens alone.
And we sent Timothy, our brother, and a helper of God, and our fellow workman in the good news of the Christ, in order to establish you and to encourage you about your faith,
for no man to be disturbed by these afflictions. For ye yourselves know that we are set for this.
For also when we were with you we foretold you that we were going to be oppressed, just as it also happened, and ye know.
Because of this, I too, no longer covering over it, sent in order to know your faith, lest somehow he who tempts was tempting you, and our labor became in vain.
But now of Timothy, having come to us from you, and having proclaimed good news to us of your faith and love, and that ye always have a good recollection of us, longing to see us, just as we also you,
because of this, brothers, we were encouraged toward you in all our affliction and necessity through your faith.
Because now we live, if ye stand firm in the Lord.
For what thanks can we repay God about you, for all the joy in which we rejoiced because of you before our God,
praying night and day above extraordinary in order to see your face and to mend the deficiencies of your faith?
Now may our God and Father himself, and our Lord Jesus Christ, direct our way to you.
And may the Lord make you increase and abound in love toward each other, and toward all men, just as also we toward you,
in order to establish your hearts unblameable in holiness before our God and Father at the coming of our Lord Jesus with all his sanctified.

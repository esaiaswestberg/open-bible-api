Paul and Silvanus and Timothy, to the congregation of Thessalonians in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ: Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
We thank God always about all of you, making recollection of you in our prayers,
remembering without ceasing your work of faith and labor of love and steadfastness of hope of our Lord Jesus Christ, before our God and Father.
Knowing, beloved brothers, your selection by God,
because the good news from us happened to you not in word only, but also in power, and in the Holy Spirit, and in much assurance, as ye know what kind of men we became among you, because of you.
And ye became imitators of us and of the Lord, having received the word in much affliction, with joy of the Holy Spirit,
in order for you to become examples to all those who believe, in Macedonia and in Achaia.
For the word of the Lord has sounded forth from you, not only in Macedonia and Achaia, but also in every place your faith toward God has gone forth, so that we have no need to say anything.
For they report about us what kind of entrance we had with you, and how ye turned to God from the idols to serve a living and true God,
and to await his Son from the heavens whom he raised from the dead-Jesus-who rescues us from the coming wrath.

And working jointly, we urge you also not to receive the grace of God in vain
(for he says, At an acceptable time I heard thee, and in a day of salvation I helped thee. Behold, now is an acceptable time. Behold, now is a day of salvation),
giving not one cause of stumbling in anything, so that the ministry may not be criticized,
but in everything commending ourselves as helpers of God, in much perseverance, in afflictions, in necessities, in restrictions,
in stripes, in imprisonments, in tumults, in labors, in sleeplessness, in hungerings,
in purity, in knowledge, in longsuffering, in kindness, in the Holy Spirit, in non-hypocritical love,
in word of truth, in power of God, through the weapons of righteousness of the right hand and of the left,
through glory and disrepute, through slander and commendation; as deceitful, and yet true;
as unknown, and well known; as dying, and behold, we live; as punished, and not put to death;
as grieving, but always rejoicing; as poor, but making many rich; as having nothing, and yet possessing all things.
O Corinthians, our mouth has been opened to you, our heart has been enlarged.
Ye are not limited in us, but ye are limited in your bowels.
But I speak the same recompense as to children, be ye also enlarged.
Do not become unequally yoked with unbelievers, for what partnership has righteousness and lawlessness? And what fellowship has light with darkness?
And what agreement has Christ with Belial? Or what share have believers with non-believers?
And what mutual agreement has a temple of God with idols? For ye are a temple of the living God, just as God said, I will dwell in them, and will walk among them. And I will be their God, and they will be a people to me.
Therefore, Come ye out from among them, and be ye separated, says the Lord, And touch no unclean thing, and I will receive you
and will be for a Father to you, and ye will be for sons and daughters to me, says the Lord Almighty.

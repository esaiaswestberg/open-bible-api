And the word of Jehovah came to me, saying,
Son of man, what is the vine tree more than any tree, the vine branch which is among the trees of the forest?
Shall wood be taken of it to make any work? Or will men take a pin of it to hang any vessel thereon?
Behold, it is cast into the fire for fuel. The fire has devoured both the ends of it, and the midst of it is burned. Is it profitable for any work?
Behold, when it was whole, it was fit for no work. How much less, when the fire has devoured it, and it is burned, shall it yet be fit for any work!
Therefore thus says the lord Jehovah: As the vine tree among the trees of the forest, which I have given to the fire for fuel, so I will give the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
And I will set my face against them. They shall go forth from the fire, but the fire shall devour them. And ye shall know that I am Jehovah when I set my face against them.
And I will make the land desolate because they have committed a trespass, says the lord Jehovah.

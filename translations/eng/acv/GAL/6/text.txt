And brothers, if a man is overtaken in some transgression, ye the spiritual, restore such in a spirit of meekness, looking to thyself lest thou also be tempted.
Bear the burdens of each other, and so fulfill the law of the Christ.
For if some man presumes to be something when he is nothing, he deceives himself.
But let each man examine his own work, and then he will have the boast in himself alone and not in the other man.
For each man will bear his own burden.
But let him who is taught in the word share in all good things with him who teaches.
Be not misled, God is not mocked, for whatever a man sows this he will also reap.
Because he who sows to his own flesh will from the flesh reap corruption, but he who sows to the Spirit will from the Spirit reap eternal life.
And let us not be weary doing good, for in our own time we will reap, not desponding.
So then as we have time, let us work what is good toward all men, and especially toward those belonging to a household of the faith.
See in how large letters I wrote to you with my hand.
As many as desire to make a good impression in flesh, these compel you to be circumcised, only so that they may not be persecuted for the cross of the Christ.
For not even those who have been circumcised themselves keep law, but they want you to be circumcised, so that they may boast in thy flesh.
But may it not be from me to boast except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom the world has been crucified to me, and I to the world.
For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision avails anything nor uncircumcision, but a new creation.
And as many as will march by this standard, peace upon them, and mercy, and upon the Israel of God.
Finally, let no man cause troubles for me, for I bear in my body the marks of the Lord Jesus.
The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ is with your spirit, brothers. Truly.

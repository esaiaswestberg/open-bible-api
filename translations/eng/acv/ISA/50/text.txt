Thus says Jehovah, Where is the bill of your mother's divorcement, with which I have put her away? Or which of my creditors is it to whom I have sold you? Behold, for your iniquities ye were sold, and for your transgressions your mother was put away.
Why, when I came, was there no man? When I called, was there none to answer? Is my hand shortened at all, that it cannot redeem? Or have I no power to deliver? Behold, at my rebuke I dry up the sea. I make the rivers a wilderness. Their fish stink because there is no water, and die for thirst.
I clothe the heavens with blackness, and I make sackcloth their covering.
The lord Jehovah has given me the tongue of those who are taught, that I may know how to sustain with words him who is weary. He awakens morning by morning. He awakens my ear to hear as those who are taught.
The lord Jehovah has opened my ear, and I was not rebellious, nor turned away backward.
I gave my back to the smiters, and my cheeks to those who plucked off the hair. I did not hide my face from shame and spitting.
For the lord Jehovah will help me. Therefore I have not been confounded. Therefore I have set my face like a flint, and I know that I shall not be put to shame.
He is near who justifies me. Who will contend with me? Let us stand up together. Who is my adversary? Let him come near to me.
Behold, the lord Jehovah will help me. Who is he who shall condemn me? Behold, all they shall grow old as a garment; the moth shall eat them up.
Who is among you that fears Jehovah, who obeys the voice of his servant? He who walks in darkness, and has no light, let him trust in the name of Jehovah, and rely upon his God.
Behold, all ye who kindle a fire, who gird yourselves about with firebrands, walk ye in the flame of your fire, and among the brands that ye have kindled. This ye shall have from my hand. Ye shall lie down in sorrow.

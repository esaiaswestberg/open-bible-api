I exhort therefore, first of all, that supplications, prayers, intercessions, thanksgivings, be made for all men,
for kings and all those who are in prominence, so that we may live a quiet and peaceful life in all piety and propriety.
For this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Savior,
who wants all men to be saved and to come to knowledge of truth.
For there is one God, and one mediator of God and men, the man Jesus Christ,
who gave himself a ransom for all, the testimony for their own times.
For which I was appointed a herald and an apostle (I speak the truth in Christ, I do not lie), a teacher of Gentiles in faith and truth.
I desire therefore the men to pray in every place, lifting up devout hands, apart from anger and argument.
And similarly, the women to adorn themselves in disciplined decorum, with reverence and sobriety, not with braided hair or gold or pearls or expensive apparel,
but (which is fitting for women professing godliness) through good works.
Let a woman learn in silence in all subjection.
But I do not allow a woman to teach, nor to have authority of a man, but to be in quietness.
For Adam was first formed, then Eve.
And Adam was not deceived, but the woman, having been deceived, became in transgression.
But she will be saved through childbearing, if they continue in faith and love and sanctification with sobriety.

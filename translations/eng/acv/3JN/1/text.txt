The elder to the beloved Gaius, whom I love in truth.
Beloved, I pray for thee to prosper concerning all things, and to be healthy, just as thy soul prospers.
For I rejoiced exceedingly of brothers coming and testifying to the truth of thee, just as thou walk in truth.
I have no greater joy than these things that I hear my children walking in truth.
Beloved, thou do a faithful thing, whatever thou work for the brothers and for strangers,
who testified about thy love in sight of the congregation, whom thou will do well having helped send on their way worthily of God.
For they went forth on behalf of the Name, taking nothing from the Gentiles.
We therefore ought to welcome such men, so that we might become fellow workmen for the truth.
I wrote to the congregation, but Diotrephes, who loves to be first of them, did not accept us.
Because of this, if I come, I will remember his works that he does, prating against us with evil words. And not being satisfied in these, he himself does not even accept the brothers, and he forbids those who would, and expels them out of the congregation.
Beloved, do not imitate the evil, but the good. The man doing right is of God. The man doing wrong has not seen God.
Demetrius has been testified by all, and by the truth itself. But we also testify, and ye know that our testimony is true.
I had many things to write, but I did not want to write to thee by pen and ink.
But I hope to see thee straightaway, and we will speak mouth to mouth. Peace to thee. The friends salute thee. Salute the friends by name.

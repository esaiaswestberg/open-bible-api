Praise ye Jehovah. Blessed is the man who fears Jehovah, who delights greatly in his commandments.
His seed shall be mighty upon earth. The generation of the upright shall be blessed.
Wealth and riches are in his house, and his righteousness endures forever.
To the upright there arises light in the darkness. He is gracious, and merciful, and righteous.
It is well with the man who deals graciously and lends. He shall maintain his cause in judgment,
for he shall never be moved. A righteous man shall be had in everlasting remembrance.
He shall not be afraid of evil tidings. His heart is fixed, trusting in Jehovah.
His heart is established, he shall not be afraid, even until he looks over his adversaries.
He has scattered, he has given to the poor. His righteousness endures forever. His horn shall be exalted with honor.
A wicked man shall see it, and be grieved. He shall gnash with his teeth, and melt away. The desire of wicked men shall perish.

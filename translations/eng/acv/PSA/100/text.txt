Make a joyful noise to Jehovah, all ye lands.
Serve Jehovah with gladness. Come before his presence with singing.
Know ye that Jehovah, he is God. It is he who has made us, and we are his. We are his people, and the sheep of his pasture.
Enter into his gates with thanksgiving, and into his courts with praise. Give thanks to him, and bless his name.
For Jehovah is good. His loving kindness is forever, and his faithfulness to all generations.

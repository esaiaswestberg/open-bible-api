Judge me, O Jehovah, for I have walked in my integrity. I have also trusted in Jehovah without wavering.
Examine me, O Jehovah, and prove me. Try my heart and my mind.
For thy loving kindness is before my eyes, and I have walked in thy truth.
I have not sat with men of falsehood, nor will I go in with dissemblers.
I hate the assembly of evildoers, and will not sit with the wicked.
I will wash my hands in innocence, so I will encompass thine altar, O Jehovah,
that I may make the voice of thanksgiving to be heard, and tell of all thy wondrous works.
Jehovah, I love the habitation of thy house, and the place where thy glory dwells.
Gather not my soul with sinners, nor my life with men of blood,
in whose hands is wickedness, and their right hand is full of bribes.
But as for me, I will walk in my integrity. Redeem me, and be merciful to me.
My foot stands in an even place. In the congregations I will bless Jehovah.

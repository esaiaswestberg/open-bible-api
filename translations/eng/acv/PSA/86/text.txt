Bow down thine ear, O Jehovah, and answer me, for I am poor and needy.
Preserve my soul, for I am devout. O thou my God, save thy servant who trusts in thee.
Be merciful to me, O Lord, for to thee do I cry all the day long.
Rejoice the soul of thy servant, for to thee, O Lord, do I lift up my soul.
For thou, Lord, are good, and ready to forgive, and abundant in loving kindness to all those who call upon thee.
Give ear, O Jehovah, to my prayer, and hearken to the voice of my supplications.
In the day of my trouble I will call upon thee, for thou will answer me.
There is none like thee among the gods, O Lord, nor like thy works.
All nations whom thou have made shall come and worship before thee, O Lord, and they shall glorify thy name.
For thou are great, and do wondrous things. Thou alone are God.
Teach me thy way, O Jehovah, I will walk in thy truth. Unite my heart to fear thy name.
I will praise thee, O Lord my God, with my whole heart, and I will glorify thy name for evermore.
For great is thy loving kindness toward me, and thou have delivered my soul from the lowest Sheol.
O God, the proud have risen up against me, and a company of violent men have sought after my soul, and have not set thee before them.
But thou, O Lord, are a God merciful and gracious, slow to anger, and abundant in loving kindness and truth.
O turn to me, and have mercy upon me. Give thy strength to thy servant, and save the son of thy handmaid.
Show me a sign for good, that those who hate me may see it, and be put to shame, because thou, Jehovah, have helped me, and comforted me.

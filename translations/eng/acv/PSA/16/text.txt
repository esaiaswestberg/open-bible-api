Preserve me, O God, for in thee do I take refuge.
Thou my soul have said to Jehovah, Thou are my Lord. I have no good beyond thee.
As for the sanctified who are in the earth, they are the excellent in whom is all my delight.
Their sorrows shall be multiplied who give gifts for another god. Their drink offerings of blood I will not offer, nor take their names upon my lips.
Jehovah is the portion of my inheritance and of my cup. Thou maintain my lot.
The lines are fallen to me in pleasant places. Yea, I have a fine heritage.
I will bless Jehovah, who has given me counsel. Yea, my heart instructs me in the night seasons.
I beheld Jehovah always before me. Because he is at my right hand, I shall not be moved.
Therefore my heart is glad, and my glory rejoices. My flesh also shall dwell in hope.
For thou will not leave my soul to Sheol, nor will thou allow thy holy man to see corruption.
Thou made known to me the path of life. Thou will fill me of joy with thy countenance.

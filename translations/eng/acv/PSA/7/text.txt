O Jehovah my God, in thee do I take refuge. Save me from all those who pursue me, and deliver me,
lest they tear my soul like a lion, rending it in pieces, while there is none to deliver.
O Jehovah my God, if I have done this, if there be iniquity in my hands,
if I have rewarded evil to him who was at peace with me, (yea, I have delivered him without cause who was my adversary),
let the enemy pursue my soul, and overtake it. Yea, let him tread my life down to the earth, and lay my glory in the dust. Selah.
Arise, O Jehovah, in thine anger. Lift up thyself against the rage of my adversaries, and awake for me the justice thou have commanded.
And let the congregation of the peoples encompass thee about, and return thou on high over them.
Jehovah shall judge the peoples. Judge me, O Jehovah, according to my righteousness, and to my integrity that is in me.
O let the wickedness of the wicked man come to an end, but establish thou the righteous man. For the righteous God tries the minds and hearts.
My shield is with God, who saves the upright in heart.
God is a righteous judge. Yea, a God who has indignation every day.
If a man does not repent, he will whet his sword. He has bent his bow, and made it ready.
He has also prepared for him the instruments of death. He makes his arrows fiery.
Behold the wicked man, he travails with iniquity. Yea, he has conceived mischief, and brought forth falsehood.
He has made a pit, and dug it, and is fallen into the ditch which he made.
His mischief shall return upon his own head, and his violence shall come down upon his own scalp.
I will give thanks to Jehovah according to his righteousness, and will sing praise to the name of Jehovah Most High.

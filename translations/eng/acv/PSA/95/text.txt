O come, let us sing to Jehovah. Let us make a joyful noise to the rock of our salvation.
Let us come before his presence with thanksgiving. Let us make a joyful noise to him with psalms.
For Jehovah is a great God, and a great King above all gods.
In his hand are the deep places of the earth. The heights of the mountains are also his.
The sea is his, and he made it. And his hands formed the dry land.
O come, let us worship and bow down. Let us kneel before Jehovah our maker.
For he is our God, and we are the people of his pasture, and the sheep of his hand. Today, O that ye would hear his voice!
Harden not your heart, as in the provocation, as the day of trial in the wilderness,
where your fathers challenged me, proved me, and saw my work.
Forty years long I was grieved with that generation, and said, It is a people that do err in their heart, and they have not known my ways.
Therefore I swore in my wrath that they should not enter into my rest.

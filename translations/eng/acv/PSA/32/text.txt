Blessed are those whose transgression is forgiven, whose sin is covered.
Blessed is the man to whom Jehovah does not impute sin, and in whose spirit there is no deceit.
When I kept silence, my bones wasted away through my groaning all the day long.
For day and night thy hand was heavy upon me. My moisture was changed as with the drought of summer. Selah.
I acknowledged my sin to thee, and I did not hide my iniquity. I said, I will confess my transgressions to Jehovah, and thou forgave the iniquity of my sin. Selah.
For this let everyone who is devout pray to thee in a time when thou may be found. Surely when the great waters overflow they shall not reach to him.
Thou are my hiding-place. Thou will preserve me from trouble. Thou will encompass me around with songs of deliverance. Selah.
I will instruct thee and teach thee in the way which thou shall go. I will counsel thee with my eye upon thee.
Become ye not as the horse, or as the mule, which have no understanding, whose trappings must be bit and bridle to hold them in, else they will not come near to thee.
Many sorrows shall be to the wicked, but he who trusts in Jehovah, loving kindness shall encompass him about.
Be glad in Jehovah, and rejoice, ye righteous. And shout for joy, all ye who are upright in heart.

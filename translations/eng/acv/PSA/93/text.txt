Jehovah reigns! He is clothed with majesty. Jehovah is clothed with strength; he has girded himself with it. The world also is established that it cannot be moved.
Thy throne is established of old. Thou are from everlasting.
The floods have lifted up, O Jehovah, the floods have lifted up their voice, the floods lift up their waves.
Above the voices of many waters, the mighty breakers of the sea, Jehovah on high is mighty.
Thy testimonies are very sure. Holiness befits thy house, O Jehovah, for evermore.

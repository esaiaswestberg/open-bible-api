O Jehovah, rebuke me not in thine anger, nor chasten me in thy hot displeasure.
Have mercy upon me, O Jehovah, for I am withered away. O Jehovah, heal me, for my bones are troubled.
My soul also is greatly troubled. And thou, O Jehovah, how long?
Return, O Jehovah, deliver my soul. Save me for thy loving kindness' sake.
For in death there is no remembrance of thee. In Sheol who shall give thee thanks?
I am weary with my groaning. Every night I make my bed to swim. I water my couch with my tears.
My eye wastes away because of grief. It grows old because of all my adversaries.
Depart from me, all ye workers of iniquity, for Jehovah has heard the voice of my weeping.
Jehovah has heard my supplication. Jehovah will receive my prayer.
All my enemies shall be put to shame and greatly troubled. They shall turn back. They shall be put to shame suddenly.

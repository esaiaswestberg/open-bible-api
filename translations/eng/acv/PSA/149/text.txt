Praise ye Jehovah. Sing to Jehovah a new song, and his praise in the assembly of the sanctified.
Let Israel rejoice in him who made him. Let the sons of Zion be joyful in their King.
Let them praise his name in the dance. Let them sing praises to him with timbrel and harp.
For Jehovah takes pleasure in his people. He will beautify the meek with salvation.
Let the sanctified exult in glory. Let them sing for joy upon their beds.
The high praises of God are in their mouth, and a two-edged sword in their hand
to execute vengeance upon the nations, and punishments upon the peoples,
to bind their kings with chains, and their ranking men with fetters of iron,
to execute upon them the judgment written. All his sanctified have this honor. Praise ye Jehovah.

O Jehovah, thou God to whom vengeance belongs, thou God to whom vengeance belongs, shine forth.
Lift up thyself, thou judge of the earth. Render to the proud a recompense.
Jehovah, how long shall the wicked, how long shall the wicked triumph?
They prate, they speak arrogantly. All the workers of iniquity boast themselves.
They break in pieces thy people, O Jehovah, and afflict thy heritage.
They kill the widow and the sojourner, and murder the fatherless.
And they say, Jehovah will not see, nor will the God of Jacob consider.
Consider, ye brutish among the people, and ye fools, when will ye be wise?
He who planted the ear, shall he not hear? He who formed the eye, shall he not see?
He who chastises the nations, shall he not correct, even he who teaches man knowledge?
Jehovah knows the thoughts of man, that they are vanity.
Blessed is the man whom thou chasten, O Jehovah, and teach out of thy law,
that thou may give him rest from the days of adversity, until the pit is dug for a wicked man.
For Jehovah will not cast off his people, nor will he forsake his inheritance.
For judgment shall return to righteousness, and all the upright in heart shall follow it.
Who will rise up for me against the evildoers? Who will stand up for me against the workers of iniquity?
Unless Jehovah had been my help, my soul would have soon dwelt in silence.
When I said, My foot slips, thy loving kindness, O Jehovah, held me up.
In the multitude of my thoughts within me thy comforts delight my soul.
Shall the throne of wickedness have fellowship with thee, which frames mischief by statute?
They gather themselves together against the soul of a righteous man, and condemn innocent blood.
But Jehovah has been my high tower, and my God the rock of my refuge.
And he has brought upon them their own iniquity, and will cut them off in their own wickedness. Jehovah our God will cut them off.

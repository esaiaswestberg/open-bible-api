Rejoice in Jehovah, O ye righteous. Praise is comely for the upright.
Give thanks to Jehovah with the harp. Sing praises to him with the psaltery of ten strings.
Sing to him a new song. Play skillfully with a loud noise.
For the word of Jehovah is right, and all his work is done in faithfulness.
He loves righteousness and justice. The earth is full of the loving kindness of Jehovah.
By the word of Jehovah were the heavens made, and all the host of them by the breath of his mouth.
He gathers the waters of the sea together as a heap. He lays up the deeps in store-houses.
Let all the earth fear Jehovah. Let all the inhabitants of the world stand in awe of him.
For he spoke, and it was done. He commanded, and it stood fast.
Jehovah brings the counsel of the nations to naught. He makes the thoughts of the peoples to be of no effect.
The counsel of Jehovah stands fast forever, the thoughts of his heart to all generations.
Blessed is the nation whose God is Jehovah, the people whom he has chosen for his own inheritance.
Jehovah looks from heaven. He beholds all the sons of men.
From the place of his habitation he looks forth upon all the inhabitants of the earth;
he who fashions the hearts of them all, who considers all their works.
There is no king saved by the multitude of an army. A mighty man is not delivered by great strength.
A horse is a vain thing for safety, nor does he deliver any by his great power.
Behold, the eye of Jehovah is upon those who fear him, upon those who hope in his loving kindness,
to deliver their soul from death, and to keep them alive in famine.
Our soul has waited for Jehovah. He is our help and our shield.
For our heart shall rejoice in him because we have trusted in his holy name.
Let thy loving kindness, O Jehovah, be upon us, according as we have hoped in thee.

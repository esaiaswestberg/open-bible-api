Help, Jehovah, for the holy man ceases, for the faithful fail from among the sons of men.
They speak falsehood everyone with his neighbor. With flattering lip, and with a double heart, they speak.
Jehovah will cut off all flattering lips, the tongue that speaks great things,
who have said, With our tongue will we prevail. Our lips are our own. Who is lord over us?
Because of the oppression of the poor, because of the sighing of the needy, now I will arise, says Jehovah. I will set him in the safety he gasps for.
The words of Jehovah are pure words, as silver tried in a furnace on the earth, purified seven times.
Thou will keep them, O Jehovah. Thou will preserve them from this generation forever.
The wicked walk on every side when vileness is exalted among the sons of men.

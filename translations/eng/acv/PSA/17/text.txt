Hear the right, O Jehovah, attend to my cry. Give ear to my prayer, that goes not out of feigned lips.
Let my justice come forth from thy presence. Let thine eyes look upon equity.
Thou have proved my heart. Thou have visited me in the night. Thou have tried me, and find nothing. I have purposed that my mouth shall not transgress.
As for the works of men, by the word of thy lips I have kept from the ways of a violent man.
My steps have held fast to thy paths. My feet have not slipped.
I have called upon thee, for thou will answer me, O God. Incline thine ear to me, and hear my speech.
Show thy marvelous loving kindness, O thou who saves by thy right hand those who take refuge from those who rise up.
Keep me as the apple of the eye. Hide me under the shadow of thy wings,
from the wicked who oppress me, my deadly enemies, who encompass me around.
They are enclosed in their own fat. With their mouth they speak proudly.
They have now encompassed us in our steps. They set their eyes to cast down to the earth.
He is like a lion that is greedy of his prey, and as it were a young lion lurking in secret places.
Arise, O Jehovah, confront him. Cast him down. Deliver my soul from the wicked by thy sword,
from men by thy hand, O Jehovah, from men of the world whose portion is in this life, and whose belly thou fill with thy treasure. They are satisfied with sons, and leave the rest of their substance to their babes.
As for me, I shall behold thy face in righteousness. I shall be satisfied, when I awake, with thy form.

I cry with my voice to Jehovah. With my voice to Jehovah I make supplication.
I pour out my complaint before him. I show my trouble before him.
When my spirit was overwhelmed within me, thou knew my path. In the way in which I walk they have hidden a snare for me.
Look on my right hand, and see, for there is no man who knows me. Refuge has failed me. No man cares for my soul.
I cried to thee, O Jehovah. I said, Thou are my refuge, my portion in the land of the living.
Attend to my cry, for I am brought very low. Deliver me from my persecutors, for they are stronger than I.
Bring my soul out of prison that I may give thanks to thy name. The righteous shall encompass me around, for thou will deal bountifully with me.

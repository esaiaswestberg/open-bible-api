Jehovah answer thee in the day of trouble. The name of the God of Jacob set thee up on high,
send thee help from the sanctuary, and strengthen thee out of Zion,
remember all thy offerings, and accept thy burnt-sacrifice (Selah),
grant thee thy heart's desire, and fulfill all thy counsel.
We will triumph in thy salvation, and in the name of our God we will set up our banners. Jehovah fulfill all thy petitions.
Now I know that Jehovah saves his anointed. He will answer him from his holy heaven with the saving strength of his right hand.
Some trust in chariots, and some in horses, but we will make mention of the name of Jehovah our God.
They are bowed down and fallen, but we are risen, and stand upright.
Save, Jehovah! Let the King answer us when we call.

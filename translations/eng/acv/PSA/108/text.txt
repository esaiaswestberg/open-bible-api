My heart is fixed, O God, I will sing, yea, I will sing praises, even with my glory.
Awake, psaltery and harp. I myself will awake right early.
I will give thanks to thee, O Jehovah, among the peoples, and I will sing praises to thee among the nations.
For thy loving kindness is great above the heavens, and thy truth is to the skies.
Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens, and thy glory above all the earth.
That thy beloved may be delivered, save with thy right hand, and answer us.
God has spoken in his holiness. I will exult. I will divide Shechem, and mete out the valley of Succoth.
Gilead is mine. Manasseh is mine. Ephraim also is the defense of my head. Judah is my scepter.
Moab is my wash pot. Upon Edom I will cast my shoe. Over Philistia I will shout.
Who will bring me into the fortified city? Who has led me to Edom?
Have thou not cast us off, O God? And thou go not forth, O God, with our armies.
Give us help against the adversary, for vain is the help of man.
Through God we shall do valiantly, for he it is who will tread down our adversaries.

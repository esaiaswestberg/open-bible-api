I will sing of loving kindness and justice. To thee, O Jehovah, I will sing praises.
I will behave myself wisely in a perfect way. O when will thou come to me? I will walk within my house with a perfect heart.
I will set no base thing before my eyes. I hate the work of those who turn aside. It shall not cleave to me.
A perverse heart shall depart from me. I will know no evil thing.
He who slanders his neighbor secretly, him I will destroy. He who has a high look and a proud heart I will not endure.
My eyes shall be upon the faithful of the land, that they may dwell with me. He who walks in a perfect way, he shall minister to me.
He who works deceit shall not dwell within my house. He who speaks falsehood shall not be established before my eyes.
Morning by morning I will destroy all the wicked of the land, to cut off all the workers of iniquity from the city of Jehovah.

Bless Jehovah, O my soul, and all that is within me, bless his holy name.
Bless Jehovah, O my soul, and forget not all his benefits,
who forgives all thine iniquities, who heals all thy diseases,
who redeems thy life from destruction, who crowns thee with loving kindness and tender mercies,
who satisfies thy desire with good things, and thy youth is renewed like the eagle.
Jehovah executes righteous acts, and judgments for all who are oppressed.
He made known his ways to Moses, his doings to the sons of Israel.
Jehovah is merciful and gracious, slow to anger, and abundant in loving kindness.
He will not always chide, nor will he keep it forever.
He has not dealt with us according to our sins, nor rewarded us according to our iniquities.
For as the heavens are high above the earth, so great is his loving kindness toward those who fear him.
As far as the east is from the west, so far has he removed our transgressions from us.
Like as a father pities his sons, So Jehovah pities those who fear him.
For he knows our frame. He remembers that we are dust.
As for man, his days are as grass, as a flower of the field, so he flourishes.
For the wind passes over it, and it is gone, and the place thereof shall know it no more.
But the loving kindness of Jehovah is from everlasting to everlasting upon those who fear him, and his righteousness to son's sons,
to such as keep his covenant, and to those who remember his precepts to do them.
Jehovah has established his throne in the heavens, and his kingdom rules over all.
Bless Jehovah, ye his agents, who are mighty in strength, who fulfill his word, hearkening to the voice of his word.
Bless Jehovah, all ye his hosts, ye ministers of his, who do his pleasure.
Bless Jehovah, all ye his works in all places of his dominion. Bless Jehovah, O my soul.

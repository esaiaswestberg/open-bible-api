The heavens declare the glory of God, and the firmament shows his handiwork.
Day to day utters speech, and night to night shows knowledge.
There is no speech nor language in which their voice is not heard.
Their line has gone out through all the earth, and their words to the end of the world. In them he has set a tabernacle for the sun,
which is as a bridegroom coming out of his chamber, and rejoices as a strong man to run his course.
His going forth is from the end of the heavens, and his circuit to the ends of it, and there is nothing hid from the heat of it.
The law of Jehovah is perfect, restoring the soul. The testimony of Jehovah is sure, making a simple man wise.
The precepts of Jehovah are right, rejoicing the heart. The commandment of Jehovah is pure, enlightening the eyes.
The fear of Jehovah is clean, enduring forever. The ordinances of Jehovah are true, and righteous altogether.
More to be desired are they than gold, yea, than much fine gold. Sweeter also than honey and the droppings of the honeycomb.
Moreover by them thy servant is warned. In keeping them there is great reward.
Who can discern his errors? Clear thou me from hidden faults.
Keep back thy servant also from presumptuous sins. Let them not have dominion over me. Then I shall be upright, and I shall be clear from great transgression.
Let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be acceptable in thy sight, O Jehovah, my rock, and my redeemer.

O God, thou are my God. I will earnestly seek thee. My soul thirsts for thee, my flesh longs for thee, in a dry and weary land, where is no water.
So I have looked upon thee in the sanctuary to see thy power and thy glory.
Because thy loving kindness is better than life, my lips shall praise thee.
So I will bless thee while I live. I will lift up my hands in thy name.
My soul shall be satisfied as with marrow and fatness. And my mouth shall praise thee with joyful lips
when I remember thee upon my bed, and meditate on thee in the night-watches.
For thou have been my help, and in the shadow of thy wings I will rejoice.
My soul follows close after thee. Thy right hand upholds me.
But those who seek my soul, to destroy it, shall go into the lower parts of the earth.
They shall be given over to the power of the sword. They shall be a portion for foxes.
But the king shall rejoice in God. Everyone who swears by him shall glory, for the mouth of those who speak lies shall be stopped.

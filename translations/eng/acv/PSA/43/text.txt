Judge me, O God, and plead my cause against a profane nation. O deliver me from the deceitful and unjust man.
For thou are the God of my strength. Why have thou cast me off? Why do I go mourning because of the oppression of the enemy?
O send out thy light and thy truth. Let them lead me. Let them bring me to thy holy hill, and to thy tabernacles.
Then I will go to the altar of God, to God my exceeding joy, and I will praise thee upon the harp, O God, my God.
Why are thou cast down, O my soul? And why are thou disquieted within me? Hope thou in God, for I shall yet praise him, the help of my countenance, and my God.

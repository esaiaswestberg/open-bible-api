Give the king thy judgments, O God, and thy righteousness to the king's son.
He will judge thy people with righteousness, and thy poor with justice.
The mountains shall bring peace to the people, and the hills, in righteousness.
He will judge the poor of the people. He will save the sons of the needy, and will break in pieces the oppressor.
They shall fear thee while the sun endures, and as long as the moon, throughout all generations.
He will come down like rain upon the mown grass, as showers that water the earth.
In his days righteousness shall flourish, and abundance of peace, till the moon is no more.
He shall also have dominion from sea to sea, and from the River to the ends of the earth.
Those who dwell in the wilderness shall bow before him, and his enemies shall lick the dust.
The kings of Tarshish and of the isles shall render tribute. The kings of Sheba and Seba shall offer gifts.
Yea, all kings shall fall down before him. All nations shall serve him.
For he will deliver a needy man when he cries, and a poor man, who has no helper.
He will have pity on a poor and needy man, and he will save the souls of the needy.
He will redeem their soul from oppression and violence. And their blood will be precious in his sight,
and they shall live. And to him shall be given of the gold of Sheba. And men shall pray for him continually. They shall bless him all the day long.
There shall be abundance of grain in the earth upon the top of the mountains. The fruit of it shall shake like Lebanon. And they of the city shall flourish like grass of the earth.
His name shall endure forever. His name shall be continued as long as the sun. And men shall be blessed in him. All nations shall call him blessed.
Blessed be Jehovah God, the God of Israel, who alone does wondrous things.
And blessed be his glorious name forever. And let the whole earth be filled with his glory. Truly, and Truly.
The prayers of David the son of Jesse are ended.

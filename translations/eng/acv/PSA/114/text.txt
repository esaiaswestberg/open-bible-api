When Israel went forth out of Egypt, the house of Jacob from a people of strange language,
Judah became his sanctuary, Israel his dominion.
The sea saw it, and fled. The Jordan was driven back.
The mountains skipped like rams, the little hills like lambs.
What ails thee, O thou sea, that thou flee? Thou Jordan, that thou turn back?
Ye mountains, that ye skip like rams, ye little hills, like lambs?
Tremble, thou earth, at the presence of the Lord, at the presence of the God of Jacob,
who turned the rock into a pool of water, the flint into a fountain of waters.

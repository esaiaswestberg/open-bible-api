Jehovah, thou have been favorable to thy land. Thou have brought back the captivity of Jacob.
Thou have forgiven the iniquity of thy people. Thou have covered all their sin. Selah.
Thou have taken away all thy wrath. Thou have turned from the fierceness of thine anger.
Turn us, O God of our salvation, and cause thine indignation toward us to cease.
Will thou be angry with us forever? Will thou draw out thine anger to all generations?
Will thou not revive us again, that thy people may rejoice in thee?
Show us thy loving kindness, O Jehovah, and grant us thy salvation.
I will hear what God, Jehovah, will speak, for he will speak peace to his people, and to his sanctified. But let them not turn again to folly.
Surely his salvation is near those who fear him, that glory may dwell in our land.
Mercy and truth are met together. Righteousness and peace have kissed each other.
Truth springs out of the earth, and righteousness has looked down from heaven.
Yea, Jehovah will give that which is good, and our land shall yield its increase.
Righteousness shall go before him, and shall make his footsteps a path.

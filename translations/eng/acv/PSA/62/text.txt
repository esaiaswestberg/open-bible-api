My soul waits in silence for God only. From him is my salvation.
He only is my rock and my salvation, my high tower. I shall not be greatly moved.

My soul, wait thou in silence for God only, for my expectation is from him.
He only is my rock and my salvation, my high tower. I shall not be moved.
With God is my salvation and my glory. The rock of my strength, and my refuge, is in God.
Trust in him at all times, ye people. Pour out your heart before him. God is a refuge for us. Selah.

God has spoken once, twice I have heard this, that power belongs to God.
Also to thee, O Lord, belongs loving kindness, for thou render to every man according to his work.

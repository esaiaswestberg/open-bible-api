Why do thou stand afar off, O Jehovah? Why do thou hide thyself in times of trouble?
In the pride of the wicked man the poor man is hotly pursued. Let them be taken in the devices that they have conceived.
For the wicked man boasts of his heart's desire. And the greedy man renounces, yea, despises Jehovah.
The wicked man, in the pride of his countenance, says, He will not require it. All his thoughts are, There is no God.
His ways are profane at all times. Thy judgments are far above out of his sight. As for all his adversaries, he puffs at them.
He says in his heart, I shall not be moved. To all generations I shall not be in adversity.
His mouth is full of cursing and deceit and oppression. Under his tongue is mischief and iniquity.
He sits in the lurking-places of the villages. In the covert places he murders the innocent man. His eyes are secretly set against the poor man.
He lurks in secret as a lion in his covert. He lies in wait to catch the poor man. He catches the poor man when he draws him in his net.
He crouches, he bows down, and helpless men fall by his strong men.
He says in his heart, God has forgotten. He hides his face. He will never see it.
Arise, O Jehovah, O God, lift up thy hand. Do not forget the poor.
Why does the wicked man despise God, and say in his heart, Thou will not require it?
Thou have seen. For thou behold mischief and spite, to repay with thy hand. The poor man commits himself to thee. Thou have been the helper of the fatherless.
Break thou the arm of the sinner and the evil man. His wickedness shall be sought, and shall not be found.
Jehovah is King forever and ever. The nations have perished out of his land.
Jehovah, thou have heard the desire of the humble. Thou will prepare their heart, thou will cause thine ear to hear,
to judge the fatherless and the oppressed, that man who is of the earth may no more be terrible.

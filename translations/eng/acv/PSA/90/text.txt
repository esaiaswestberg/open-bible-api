Lord, thou have been our dwelling-place in all generations.
Before the mountains were brought forth, or thou had ever formed the earth and the world, even from everlasting to everlasting, thou are God.
Thou turn man to destruction, and say, Return, ye sons of men.
For a thousand years in thy sight are but as yesterday when it is past, and as a watch in the night.
Thou carry them away as with a flood. They are as a sleep. In the morning they are like grass which grows up.
In the morning it flourishes, and grows up. In the evening it is cut down, and withers.
For we are consumed in thine anger, and in thy wrath are we troubled.
Thou have set our iniquities before thee, our secret sins in the light of thy countenance.
For all our days are passed away in thy wrath. We bring our years to an end as a sigh.
The days of our years are threescore years and ten, or even by reason of strength fourscore years, yet their pride is but labor and sorrow, for it is soon gone, and we fly away.
Who knows the power of thine anger, and thy wrath according to the fear that is due to thee?
So teach us to number our days, that we may get us a heart of wisdom.
Return, O Jehovah. How long? And relent concerning thy servants.
O satisfy us in the morning with thy loving kindness, that we may rejoice and be glad all our days.
Make us glad according to the days in which thou have afflicted us, and the years in which we have seen evil.
Let thy work appear to thy servants, and thy glory upon their sons.
And let the favor of the Lord our God be upon us. And establish thou the work of our hands upon us, yea, the work of our hands establish thou it.

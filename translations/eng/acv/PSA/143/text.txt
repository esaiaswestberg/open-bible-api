Hear my prayer, O Jehovah. Give ear to my supplications. In thy faithfulness answer me, and in thy righteousness.
And enter not into judgment with thy servant. For in thy sight no man living is righteous.
For the enemy has persecuted my soul. He has smitten my life down to the ground. He has made me to dwell in dark places as those who have been long dead.
Therefore my spirit is overwhelmed within me. My heart within me is desolate.
I remember the days of old. I meditate on all thy doings. I muse on the work of thy hands.
I spread forth my hands to thee. My soul is as a weary land for thee. Selah.
Make haste to answer me, O Jehovah, my spirit fails. Hide not thy face from me, lest I become like those who go down into the pit.
Cause me to hear thy loving kindness in the morning, for in thee do I trust. Cause me to know the way in which I should walk, for I lift up my soul to thee.
Deliver me, O Jehovah, from my enemies. I flee to thee to hide me.
Teach me to do thy will, for thou are my God. Thy Spirit is good, lead me in the land of uprightness.
Revive me, O Jehovah, for thy name's sake. In thy righteousness bring my soul out of trouble.
And in thy loving kindness cut off my enemies, and destroy all those who afflict my soul, for I am thy servant.

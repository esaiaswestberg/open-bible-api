O God, the nations have come into thine inheritance. They have defiled thy holy temple. They have laid Jerusalem in heaps.
They have given the dead bodies of thy servants to be food to the birds of the heavens, the flesh of thy sanctified to the beasts of the earth.
They have shed their blood like water round about Jerusalem, and there was none to bury them.
We have become a reproach to our neighbors, a scoffing and derision to those who are round about us.
How long, O Jehovah? Will thou be angry forever? Shall thy jealousy burn like fire?
Pour out thy wrath upon the nations that do not know thee, and upon the kingdoms that do not call upon thy name.
For they have devoured Jacob, and laid waste his habitation.
Do not remember against us the iniquities of our forefathers. Let thy tender mercies speedily meet us, for we are brought very low.
Help us, O God of our salvation, for the glory of thy name. And deliver us, and forgive our sins, for thy name's sake.
Why should the nations say, Where is their God? Let the avenging of the blood of thy servants which is shed be known among the nations in our sight.
Let the sighing of the prisoner come before thee. According to the greatness of thy power preserve thou those who are appointed to death,
and render to our neighbors sevenfold into their bosom their reproach with which they have reproached thee, O Lord,
so we thy people and sheep of thy pasture will give thee thanks forever. We will show forth thy praise to all generations.

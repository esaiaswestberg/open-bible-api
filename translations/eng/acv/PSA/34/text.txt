I will bless Jehovah at all times. His praise shall continually be in my mouth.
My soul shall make its boast in Jehovah. The humble shall hear of it, and be glad.
O magnify Jehovah with me, and let us exalt his name together.
I sought Jehovah, and he answered me, and delivered me from all my fears.
They looked to him, and were radiant, and their faces shall never be confounded.
This poor man cried, and Jehovah heard him, and saved him out of all his troubles.
The agent of Jehovah encamps round about those who fear him, and delivers them.
O taste and see that Jehovah is good. Blessed is the man who takes refuge in him.
O fear Jehovah, ye his sanctified, for there is no want to those who fear him.
The young lions do lack, and suffer hunger, but those who seek Jehovah shall not want any good thing.
Come, ye children, hearken to me. I will teach you the fear of Jehovah.
What man is he who desires life, and loves many days, that he may see good?
Keep thy tongue from evil, and thy lips from speaking deceit.
Depart from evil, and do good. Seek peace, and pursue it.
The eyes of Jehovah are toward the righteous, and his ears are open to their prayer.
(The face of Jehovah is against those who do evil, to cut off the remembrance of them from the earth.)
They cried, and Jehovah heard, and delivered them out of all their troubles.
Jehovah is near to those who are of a broken heart, and saves such as are of a contrite spirit.
Many are the afflictions of the righteous, but Jehovah delivers him out of them all.
He keeps all his bones. Not one of them is broken.
Evil shall kill the wicked, and those who hate the righteous shall be condemned.
Jehovah redeems the soul of his servants, and none of those who take refuge in him shall be condemned.

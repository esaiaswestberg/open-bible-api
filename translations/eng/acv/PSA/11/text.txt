In Jehovah I take refuge. How will ye say to my soul, Flee as a bird to your mountain.
For, lo, the wicked bend the bow. They make ready their arrow upon the string that they may shoot in darkness at the upright in heart.
If the foundations be destroyed, what can a righteous man do?
Jehovah is in his holy temple. Jehovah's throne is in heaven. His eyes, behold, his eyelids try, the sons of men.
Jehovah tries the righteous man, but his soul hates the wicked man and him who loves violence.
He will rain snares upon sinners. Fire and brimstone and burning wind shall be the portion of their cup.
For Jehovah is righteous. He loves righteousness. The upright man shall behold his face.

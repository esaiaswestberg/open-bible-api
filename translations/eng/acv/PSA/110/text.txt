Jehovah says to my Lord, Sit thou at my right hand until I make thine enemies thy footstool.
Jehovah will send forth the rod of thy strength out of Zion. Rule thou in the midst of thine enemies.
Thy people offer themselves willingly in the day of thy power, in holy array. Out of the womb of the morning thou have the dew of thy youth.
Jehovah has sworn, and will not repent. Thou are a priest forever after the order of Melchizedek.
The Lord at thy right hand will strike through kings in the day of his wrath.
He will judge among the nations. He will fill with dead bodies. He will strike through the head in many countries.
He will drink of the brook in the way, therefore he will lift up the head.

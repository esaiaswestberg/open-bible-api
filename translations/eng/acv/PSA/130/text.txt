Out of the depths I have cried to thee, O Jehovah.
Lord, hear my voice. Let thine ears be attentive to the voice of my supplications.
If thou, Jehovah, should note iniquities, O Lord, who could stand?
But there is forgiveness with thee, that thou may be feared.
I wait for Jehovah. My soul waits, and in his word do I hope,
my soul for the Lord more than watchmen for the morning, watchmen for the morning.
O Israel, hope in Jehovah, for with Jehovah there is loving kindness, and with him is plentiful redemption.
And he will redeem Israel from all his iniquities.

He who dwells in the secret place of the Most High shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty.
I will say of Jehovah, He is my refuge and my fortress, my God, in whom I trust.
For he will deliver thee from the snare of the fowler, and from the deadly pestilence.
He will cover thee with his pinions, and under his wings shall thou take refuge. His truth is a shield and a buckler.
Thou shall not be afraid for the terror by night, nor for the arrow that flies by day,
for the pestilence that walks in darkness, nor for the destruction that wastes at noonday.
A thousand shall fall at thy side, and ten thousand at thy right hand, but it shall not come near thee.
Thou shall only behold with thine eyes, and see the reward of the wicked.
For thou, O Jehovah, are my refuge! Thou have made the Most High thy habitation.
There shall no evil befall thee, nor shall any plague come near thy tent,
for he will give his agents charge over thee, to keep thee in all thy ways.
They shall bear thee up in their hands, lest thou dash thy foot against a stone.
Thou shall tread upon the lion and adder. The young lion and the serpent thou shall trample under foot.
Because he has set his love upon me, therefore I will deliver him. I will set him on high because he has known my name.
He shall call upon me, and I will answer him. I will be with him in trouble. I will deliver him, and honor him.
I will satisfy him with long life, and show him my salvation.

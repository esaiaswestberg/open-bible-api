And it came to pass on the day that Moses made an end of setting up the tabernacle, that he anointed it and sanctified it, and all the furniture of it, and the altar and all the vessels of it, and anointed them and sanctified them.
Then the rulers of Israel, the heads of their fathers' houses, offered. These were the rulers of the tribes. These are those who were over those who were numbered.
And they brought their oblation before Jehovah: six covered wagons, and twelve oxen; a wagon for every two of the rulers, and for each one an ox. And they presented them before the tabernacle.
And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,
Take it from them, that they may be used in doing the service of the tent of meeting. And thou shall give them to the Levites, to every man according to his service.
And Moses took the wagons and the oxen, and gave them to the Levites.
Two wagons and four oxen he gave to the sons of Gershon, according to their service.
And he gave four wagons and eight oxen to the sons of Merari, according to their service, under the hand of Ithamar the son of Aaron the priest.
But he gave none to the sons of Kohath, because the service of the sanctuary belonged to them. They bore it upon their shoulders.
And the rulers offered for the dedication of the altar in the day that it was anointed, even the rulers offered their oblation before the altar.
And Jehovah said to Moses, They shall offer their oblation, each ruler on his day, for the dedication of the altar.

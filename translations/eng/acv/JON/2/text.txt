Then Jonah prayed to Jehovah his God out of the sea creatures belly.
And he said, I called because of my affliction to Jehovah, and he answered me. Out of the belly of Sheol I cried, and thou heard my voice.
For thou cast me into the depth, in the heart of the seas, and the flood was round about me. All thy waves and thy billows passed over me.
And I said, I am cast out from before thine eyes. Yet I will look again toward thy holy temple.
The waters encompassed me around, even to the soul. The deep was round about me. The weeds were wrapped around my head.
I went down to the bottoms of the mountains. The earth with its bars closed upon me forever. Yet thou have brought up my life from the pit, O Jehovah my God.
When my soul fainted within me, I remembered Jehovah. And my prayer came in to thee, into thy holy temple.
Those who regard lying vanities forsake their own mercy.
But I will sacrifice to thee with the voice of thanksgiving. I will pay that which I have vowed. Salvation is of Jehovah.
And Jehovah spoke to the sea creature, and it vomited Jonah out upon the dry land.

Now in those days, the disciples being multiplied, there developed a murmuring of the Hellenists against the Hebrews because their widows were neglected in the daily assistance.
And the twelve, having summoned the multitude of the disciples, they said, It is not right for us, having left the word of God behind, to serve tables.
Therefore, brothers, seek ye out seven men from you being well reported, full of the Holy Spirit and of wisdom, whom we may appoint over this need.
But we will continue steadfastly in prayer, and in the service of the word.
And the word was pleasing before all the multitude. And they chose Stephen, a man full of faith and of the Holy Spirit, and Philip, and Prochorus, and Nicanor, and Timon, and Parmenas, and Nicolas, a proselyte, a citizen of Antioch,
men whom they placed before the apostles. And having prayed, they laid hands upon them.
And the word of God increased, and the number of the disciples multiplied greatly in Jerusalem, and a large company of the priests were obedient to the faith.
And Stephen, full of faith and power, did great wonders and signs among the people.
But some of those from the synagogue called Libertines, and of the Cyrenians, and of the Alexandrians, and of those from Cilicia and Asia, rose up disputing with Stephen.
And they were not able to withstand the wisdom and the spirit by which he spoke.
Then they instigated men who said, We have heard him speaking blasphemous sayings against Moses and God.
And they incited the people, and the elders, and the scholars. And after approaching, they seized him, and brought him to the council.
And they put forward false witnesses who said, This man does not cease speaking blasphemous sayings against the holy place, and the law.
For we have heard him saying that this Jesus the Nazarene will destroy this place, and will change the customs that Moses delivered to us.
And all who sat in the council, having gazed upon him, saw his face like a face of an agent.

And God said to Jacob, Arise, go up to Bethel, and dwell there, and make an altar there to God, who appeared to thee when thou fled from the face of Esau thy brother.
Then Jacob said to his household, and to all who were with him, Put away the foreign gods that are among you, and purify yourselves, and change your garments.
And let us arise, and go up to Bethel, and I will make there an altar to God, who answered me in the day of my distress, and was with me on the way which I went.
And they gave to Jacob all the foreign gods which were in their hand, and the rings which were in their ears. And Jacob hid them under the oak that was by Shechem.
And they journeyed, and a terror of God was upon the cities that were round about them, and they did not pursue after the sons of Jacob.
So Jacob came to Luz, which is in the land of Canaan (the same is Bethel), he and all the people that were with him.
And he built there an altar, and called the place El-bethel, because God was revealed to him there, when he fled from the face of his brother.
And Deborah Rebekah's nurse died, and she was buried below Bethel under the oak. And the name of it was called Allon-bacuth.
And God appeared to Jacob again, when he came from Paddan-aram, and blessed him.
And God said to him, Thy name is Jacob. Thy name shall not be called any more Jacob, but Israel shall be thy name. And he called his name Israel.
And God said to him, I am God Almighty. Be fruitful and multiply. A nation and a company of nations shall be of thee, and kings shall come out of thy loins.
And the land which I gave to Abraham and Isaac, I will give it to thee, and I will give the land to thy seed after thee.
And God went up from him in the place where he spoke with him.
And Jacob set up a pillar in the place where he spoke with him, a pillar of stone. And he poured out a drink offering on it, and poured oil on it.
And Jacob called the name of the place where God spoke with him, Bethel.
And they journeyed from Bethel. And there was still some distance to come to Ephrath, and Rachel travailed, and she had hard labor.
And it came to pass, when she was in hard labor, that the midwife said to her, Fear not, for now thou shall have another son.
And it came to pass, as her soul was departing (for she died), that she called his name Ben-oni, but his father called him Benjamin.
And Rachel died, and was buried on the way to Ephrath (the same is Bethlehem).
And Jacob set up a pillar upon her grave, the same is the Pillar of Rachel's grave to this day.
And Israel journeyed, and spread his tent beyond the tower of Eder.
And it came to pass, while Israel dwelt in that land, that Reuben went and lay with Bilhah his father's concubine, and Israel heard of it. Now the sons of Jacob were twelve.
The sons of Leah: Reuben, Jacob's firstborn, and Simeon, and Levi, and Judah, and Issachar, and Zebulun.
The sons of Rachel: Joseph and Benjamin.
And the sons of Bilhah, Rachel's handmaid: Dan and Naphtali.
And the sons of Zilpah, Leah's handmaid: Gad and Asher. These are the sons of Jacob, who were born to him in Paddan-aram.
And Jacob came to Isaac his father to Mamre, to Kiriath-arba (the same is Hebron), where Abraham and Isaac sojourned.
And the days of Isaac were a hundred and eighty years.
And Isaac gave up the spirit, and died, and was gathered to his people, old and full of days. And Esau and Jacob his sons buried him.

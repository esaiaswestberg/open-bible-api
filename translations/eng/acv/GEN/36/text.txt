Now these are the generations of Esau (the same is Edom).
Esau took his wives of the daughters of Canaan: Adah the daughter of Elon the Hittite, and Oholibamah the daughter of Anah, the daughter of Zibeon the Hivite,
and Basemath Ishmael's daughter, sister of Nebaioth.
And Adah bore to Esau Eliphaz, and Basemath bore Reuel,
and Oholibamah bore Jeush, and Jalam, and Korah. These are the sons of Esau, who were born to him in the land of Canaan.
And Esau took his wives, and his sons, and his daughters, and all the souls of his house, and his cattle, and all his beasts, and all his possessions, which he had gathered in the land of Canaan, and went into a land away from his brother Jacob.
For their substance was too great for them to dwell together, and the land of their sojourning could not bear them because of their cattle.
And Esau dwelt in mount Seir. Esau is Edom.
And these are the generations of Esau the father of the Edomites in mount Seir:
These are the names of Esau's sons: Eliphaz the son of Adah the wife of Esau, Reuel the son of Basemath the wife of Esau.
And the sons of Eliphaz were Teman, Omar, Zepho, and Gatam, and Kenaz.
And Timna was concubine to Eliphaz Esau's son, and she bore to Eliphaz Amalek. These are the sons of Adah, Esau's wife.

And these are the kings that reigned in the land of Edom, before any king reigned over the sons of Israel.

The word of the Lord that came to Jeremiah the prophet concerning the Philistines, before that Pharaoh struck Gaza.
"Thus says the Lord: 'Behold, waters rise up out of the north, and shall become an overflowing stream, and shall overflow the land and all that is therein, the city and those who dwell therein; and the men shall cry, and all the inhabitants of the land shall wail.
At the noise of the stamping of the hoofs of his strong ones, at the rushing of his chariots, at the rumbling of his wheels, the fathers do not look back to their children for feebleness of hands;
because of the day that comes to destroy all the Philistines, to cut off from Tyre and Sidon every helper who remains: for the Lord will destroy the Philistines, the remnant of the isle of Caphtor.
Baldness has come on Gaza; Ashkelon is brought to nothing, the remnant of their valley: how long will you cut yourself?
You sword of the Lord, "how long will it be before you be quiet? Put up yourself into your scabbard; rest, and be still."
How can you be quiet, since the Lord has given you a command? Against Ashkelon, and against the seashore, there has he appointed it.'"

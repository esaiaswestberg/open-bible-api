Harness the horses; and get up, ye horsemen, and stand forth with [your] helmets; furbish the spears, [and] put on the brigandines.
Why have I seen them dismayed [and] turned away back? and their mighty ones are beaten down and are fled in haste, and do not look back: [for] fear [was] round about, said the LORD.

Egypt rises up like a flood, and [his] waters move like rivers; and he said, I will go up [and] will cover the earth; I will destroy the city and its inhabitants.
Come up, ye horses; and rage, ye chariots; and let the mighty men come forth; the Ethiopians and the Libyans, that handle the shield; and the Lydians, that handle [and] bend the bow.
But this day [shall be] unto the Lord GOD of the hosts, a day of vengeance, that he may avenge him of his adversaries; and the sword shall devour, and it shall be satiated and made drunk with their blood; for it [shall be a] slaughter unto the Lord GOD of the hosts in the north country [by] the river Euphrates.
Go up into Gilead, and take balm, O virgin, the daughter of Egypt: in vain shalt thou use many medicines; [for] there is no cure for thee.
The nations have heard of thy shame, and thy cry has filled the land; for the mighty man has stumbled against the mighty, [and] they are both fallen together.
The word that the LORD spoke to Jeremiah the prophet, how Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon should come [and] smite the land of Egypt.
Declare ye in Egypt, and publish in Migdol, and publish in Memphis and in Tahpanhes: say ye, Stand fast, and prepare thee; for the sword shall devour round about thee.

They cried there: Pharaoh king of Egypt [is but] a noise; he allowed the appointed time to pass [by].
[As] I live, saith the King, whose name [is] the LORD of the hosts, Surely as Tabor [is] among the mountains, and as Carmel by the sea, [so] shall he come.

Egypt [is like] a very fair heifer, [but] destruction comes; it comes out of the north.
Also her soldiers [are] in the midst of her like fatted bullocks; for they also turned back, [and] all fled away without stopping: because the day of their calamity was come upon them [and] the time of their visitation.
Her voice shall go forth like a serpent; for they shall march with an army and come against her with axes as hewers of wood.
They shall cut down her forest, saith the LORD, for they cannot be counted because they are more than the locusts; they [are] innumerable.

The word that Jeremiah the prophet spoke unto Baruch the son of Neriah, when he had written these words in a book at the mouth of Jeremiah, in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah, saying,
Thus hath the LORD, the God of Israel said unto thee, O Baruch:
Thou didst say, Woe is me now! for the LORD has added grief to my sorrow; I fainted in my sighing, and I have found no rest.
Thus shalt thou say unto him, The LORD said thus: Behold, I destroy those whom I have built up and those whom I have planted I pluck up, even this whole land.
And dost thou seek great things for thyself? seek [them] not; for, behold, I bring evil upon all flesh, said the LORD: but I will give thee thy life as a spoil [of battle] in all places where thou goest.:

And the whole congregation of the sons of Israel assembled together at Shiloh and set up the tabernacle of the testimony there after the land was subdued before them.
And there remained among the sons of Israel seven tribes who had not yet received their inheritance.
And Joshua said unto the sons of Israel, How long [shall] ye be negligent to go to possess the land, which the LORD God of your fathers has given you?
Indicate from among you three men for [each] tribe that I may send them and [let them] arise and walk through the land and draw it according to its inheritances; and they shall return unto me.
And they shall divide it into seven parts; Judah shall abide in their borders towards the Negev, and the house of Joseph shall abide in their borders on the north.
Ye shall therefore draw up the land [into] seven parts and bring [the description] here that I may cast lots for you here before the LORD our God.
But the Levites have no part among you; for the priesthood of the LORD [is] their inheritance; and Gad and Reuben and half the tribe of Manasseh have received their inheritance of the other side of the Jordan on the east, which Moses, the servant of the LORD, gave them.
And the men arose and went away; and Joshua charged those that went to draw the land, saying unto them, Go and walk through the land and draw it up and return to me that I may cast lots for you here before the LORD in Shiloh.
And those men went and passed through the land, drawing it by cities into seven parts in a book and came [again] to Joshua to the camp at Shiloh.
And Joshua cast lots for them in Shiloh before the LORD; and there Joshua divided the land unto the sons of Israel according to their portions.
And the lot of the tribe of the sons of Benjamin came up according to their families; and the border of their lot came forth between the sons of Judah and the sons of Joseph.
And their border on the side of the north was from the Jordan and that border goes up beside Jericho on the north side and up to the mountain westward and comes out at the wilderness of Bethaven;
and from there that border passes through Luz, by the side of Luz (which [is] Bethel) towards the Negev. And this border descends from Atarothadar to the mountain that [is] towards the Negev of the lower Bethhoron.
And this border turns and compasses the side of the sea towards the Negev unto the mountain that is before Bethhoron towards the Negev, and it comes out at Kirjathbaal, which [is] Kirjathjearim, a city of the sons of Judah. This [is] the west quarter.
And the side of the Negev [is] from the end of Kirjathjearim, and the border goes out to the west and comes out at the well of waters of Nephtoah,
and this border descends to the end of the mountain that is before the valley of the son of Hinnom, which [is] in the valley of the giants to the north, and descends then to the valley of Hinnom, to the side of the Jebusite towards the Negev and [from there] descends to the fountain of Rogel,
and from the north it turns and goes to Enshemesh and [from there] goes to Geliloth, which [is] over against the ascent to Adummim, and descends to the stone of Bohan, the son of Reuben
and passes along toward the side over against the valley of the north and descends to the plain;
and this border turns to pass to the side of Bethhoglah northward, and the border comes out at the north bay of the salt sea at the end of the Jordan towards the Negev. This [is] the border towards the Negev.
And Jordan finishes this border on the east side. This [is] the inheritance of the sons of Benjamin, by the borders thereof round about, according to their families.
Now the cities of the tribe of the sons of Benjamin according to their families were Jericho, Bethhoglah, the valley of Keziz,
Betharabah, Zemaraim, Bethel,
Avim, Parah, Ophrah,
Chepharhaammonai, Ophni, and Gaba: twelve cities with their villages;
Gibeon, Ramah, Beeroth,
Mizpeh, Chephirah, Mozah,
Rekem, Irpeel, Taralah,
Zelah, Eleph, Jebusi, which [is] Jerusalem, Gibeath [and] Kirjath: fourteen cities with their villages. This [is] the inheritance of the sons of Benjamin according to their families.:

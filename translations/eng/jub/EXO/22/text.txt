If a man shall steal an ox or a sheep and kill it or sell it he shall restore five oxen for an ox and four sheep for a sheep.
If a thief is found breaking into a house and is smitten so he dies, [he that killed him] shall not be guilty of his blood.
If the sun is risen upon him, [he that killed him] is guilty of his blood; [the thief] should make full restitution; if he has nothing, then he shall be sold for his theft.
If he is found with the theft in his hand, whether it be ox or ass or sheep, he shall restore double.
If a man shall cause a field or vineyard to be eaten and shall put in his beast and shall feed in another man's field; of the best of his own field and of the best of his own vineyard shall he make restitution.
When fires are lit and in burning the thorns burn also the stacks of sheaves or the standing grain, or the field is consumed; he that kindled the fire shall surely make restitution.
When a man shall deliver unto his neighbour money or stuff to keep, and it is stolen out of the man's house; if the thief is found, let him pay double.
If the thief is not found, then the master of the house shall be brought unto the judges [to see] whether he has put his hand unto his neighbour's goods.
For all manner of fraud, [whether it be] for [an] ox, for [an] ass, for [a] sheep, for raiment, [or] for any manner of lost thing, which [another] challenges to be his, the cause of both parties shall come before the judges; [and] whom the judges shall condemn, he shall pay double unto his neighbour.
If a man delivers unto his neighbour an ass or an ox or a sheep or any beast to keep, and it dies or is hurt or driven away, no man seeing [it],
[then] shall an oath of the LORD be between them both, that he has not put his hand unto his neighbour's goods, and the owner of it shall accept [thereof], and he shall not make [it] good.
And if it is stolen from him, he shall make restitution unto its owner.
If it is torn in pieces, [then] let him bring witness, [and] he shall not make good that which was torn.
And if anyone borrows [anything] of his neighbour, and it is hurt or dies, its owner not [being] with it, he shall surely make [it] good.
[But] if its owner [is] with it, he shall not make [it] good; if it [was] hired, it came for its hire.
If a man should entice a virgin that is not betrothed and lie with her, he shall surely endow her and [take her] to be his wife.
If her father utterly refuse to give her unto him, he shall pay money according to the dowry of virgins.
Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live.
Whoever lies with a beast shall surely be put to death.
He that sacrifices unto [any] god, except unto the LORD only, he shall be utterly destroyed.
Thou shalt neither mistreat a stranger nor oppress him; for ye were strangers in the land of Egypt.
Ye shall not afflict any widow or fatherless child.
If thou afflict them in any manner, and they cry at all unto me, I will surely hear their cry;
and my wrath shall wax hot, and I will kill you with the sword; and your wives shall be widows, and your children fatherless.
If thou should lend money to my people, to the poor [who is] with thee, thou shalt not be to him as a usurer, neither shalt thou lay upon him usury.
If thou at all take thy neighbour's clothing as a pledge, thou shalt deliver it unto him before the sun goes down;
for only that [is] his covering, it [is] his clothing to [cover] his flesh, in which he must sleep; and it shall come to pass, when he cries unto me, that I will hear, for I [am] merciful.
Thou shalt not revile the judges nor curse the prince of thy people.
Thou shalt not delay [to offer] the first of thy ripe fruits and of thy liquors; the firstborn of thy sons shalt thou give unto me.
Likewise shalt thou do with thine oxen [and] with thy sheep; seven days it shall be with his dam; on the eighth day thou shalt give it [to] me.
And ye shall be holy men unto me; neither shall ye eat [any] flesh [that is] torn of beasts in the field; ye shall cast it to the dogs.:

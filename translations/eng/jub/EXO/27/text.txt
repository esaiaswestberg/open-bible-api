And thou shalt make its pans to receive [the ashes with] its [burnt] fat, and its shovels and its basins and its fleshhooks and its firepans; all the vessels thereof thou shalt make [of] brass.

In the same manner thou shalt make the court of the tabernacle; to the side of the Negev to the south [there shall be] hangings for the court [of] fine twined linen of one hundred cubits long for each side;
and its twenty pillars and their twenty sockets [shall be of] brass; the capitals of the pillars and their fillets [shall be of] silver.
And likewise for the side of the Aquilon in length [there shall be] hangings of one hundred [cubits] long, and its twenty pillars with their twenty sockets [of] brass, the capitals of the pillars and their fillets [of] silver.
And [for] the breadth of the court on the west side [shall be] hangings of fifty cubits, their pillars ten, and their sockets ten.
And the breadth of the court on the side of the rising [sun] to the east [shall be] fifty cubits.
The hangings of one side [of the gate shall be] fifteen cubits, their pillars three, and their sockets three.
And on the other side [shall be] hangings [of] fifteen [cubits], their pillars three, and their sockets three.
And at the gate of the court [there shall be] a hanging of twenty cubits [of] blue and purple and scarlet and fine twined linen, wrought with needlework; [and] their pillars [shall be] four and their sockets four.
All the pillars round about the court [shall be] filleted with silver; their capitals [shall be of] silver, and their sockets [of] brass.
The length of the court [shall be] one hundred cubits and the breadth fifty on the one side and fifty on the other and the height five cubits, [its hangings of] fine twined linen and their sockets [of] brass.
All the vessels of the tabernacle in all the service thereof and all the stakes thereof and all the stakes of the court, [shall be of] brass.
And thou shalt command the sons of Israel that they bring thee olive oil, clear, crushed, for the light, to cause the lamps to burn always.
In the tabernacle of the testimony outside the veil, which [shall be] before [the ark of] the testimony, Aaron and his sons shall order them from evening to morning before the LORD; [it shall be] a perpetual statute of the sons of Israel for their generations.:

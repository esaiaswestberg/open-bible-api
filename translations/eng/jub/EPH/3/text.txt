For this cause I, Paul, the prisoner of Jesus Christ for you Gentiles,
if ye have heard of the dispensation of the grace of God which has been given to me in you,
how that by revelation he made known unto me the mystery (as I wrote above in [a] few words,
by which, when ye read, ye may understand my knowledge in the mystery of the Christ),
which in other generations was not made known unto the sons of men as it is now revealed unto his holy apostles and prophets in the Spirit,
that the Gentiles should be fellow heirs and of the same body and partakers of his promise in the Christ by the gospel,
of which I was made a minister, according to the gift of the grace of God given unto me by the operation of his power.
Unto me, who am less than the least of all saints, is this grace given that I should preach among the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of the Christ
and to make all [men] see what [is] the fellowship of the mystery, which from the ages has been hid in God, who created all things by Jesus Christ.
To the intent that now unto the principalities and powers in heavenly [places] might be known by the church the manifold wisdom of God,
according to the eternal purpose which he purposed in Christ Jesus our Lord,
In whom we have security and access with confidence by the faith of him.
Therefore I desire that ye faint not at my tribulations for you, which is your glory.
For this cause I bow my knees unto the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ
(of whom the whole family in [the] heavens and on earth is named),
that he would grant you, according to the riches of his glory, to be strengthened with might by his Spirit in the inner man,
that the Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith, that ye, being rooted and grounded in charity,
may be able to [well] comprehend with all saints what [is] the breadth and length and depth and height
and to know the charity of the Christ, which passes all knowledge, that ye might be filled with all the fullness of God.
Now unto him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power that works in us,
unto him [be] glory in the church by Christ Jesus throughout all generations of the ages of the ages. Amen.:

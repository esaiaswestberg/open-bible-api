If ye then are risen with Christ, seek those things which are above, where the Christ sits at the right hand of God.
Set your affection on things above, not on things on the earth.
For ye are dead and your life is hid with the Christ in God.
When Christ, [who] is our life, shall be manifested, then shall ye also be manifested with him in glory.
Mortify therefore your members which are upon the earth: fornication, uncleanness, inordinate affection, evil lust, and covetousness, which is idolatry;
for which things' sake the wrath of God comes on the sons of disobedience,
in which ye also walked some time, when ye lived in them.
But now let ye also put off all these things: anger, wrath, malice, blasphemy, filthy communication out of your mouth.
Lie not one to another, putting off the old man with his deeds
and [being] clothed with the new [man], who is renewed in knowledge according to the image of the one that created him,
where there is neither Greek nor Jew, circumcision nor uncircumcision, Barbarian nor Scythian, servant [nor] free: but Christ [is] all and in all.
Clothed, therefore, (as the elect of God, holy and beloved) with bowels of mercies, with kindness, with humility, with meekness, with tolerance,
forbearing one another and forgiving one another if anyone has a quarrel against another: even as Christ forgave you, so also [do] ye.
And above all these things [put on] charity, which is the bond of perfection.
And let the peace of God rule in your hearts, into which likewise ye are called into one body, and be ye thankful.
Let the word of the Christ dwell in you in abundance in all wisdom, teaching you and exhorting you one to another with psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, with grace singing in your hearts unto the Lord.
And whatever ye do whether in word or deed, [do] all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to the God and Father by him.
Wives, be subject to your own husbands as it is fit in the Lord.
Husbands, love [your] wives and do not be bitter against them.
Children, obey [your] parents in all things, for this is well pleasing unto the Lord.
Fathers, provoke not your children lest they become disheartened.
Servants, in all things hearken unto [your] masters according to the flesh, not serving to be seen as those who [only] please men, but in simplicity of heart, fearing God;
And whatever ye do, do [it] heartily, as to the Lord, and not unto men,
knowing that of the Lord ye shall receive the reward of the inheritance, for ye serve the Lord Christ.
But he that does wrong shall receive the wrong which he has done, [now] that there is no respect of persons.:

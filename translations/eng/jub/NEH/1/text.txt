The words of Nehemiah, the son of Hachaliah. And it came to pass in the month Chisleu, in the twentieth year, as I was in Shushan, the palace,
that Hanani, one of my brethren, came, he and [certain] men of Judah; and I asked them concerning the Jews that had escaped, which were left of the captivity, and concerning Jerusalem.
And they said unto me, The remnant that are left of the captivity there in the province [are] in great affliction and reproach, and the wall of Jerusalem [is] broken down, and its gates are burned with fire.
And it came to pass, when I heard these words, that I sat down and wept and mourned [certain] days and fasted and prayed before the God of the heavens
and said, I beseech thee, O LORD God of the heavens, strong, great and terrible, who keeps covenant and mercy for those that love thee and observe thy commandments;
let thine ear now be attentive and thine eyes open, that thou may hear the prayer of thy servant, which I pray before thee now, day and night, for the sons of Israel, thy servants, and I confess the sins of the sons of Israel, with which we have sinned against thee; both I and my father's house have sinned.
We have dealt very corruptly against thee and have not kept the commandments nor the statutes nor the judgments, which thou didst command thy servant Moses.
Remember, I beseech thee, the word that thou didst command thy servant Moses, saying, [If] ye transgress, I will scatter you abroad among the peoples;
but [if] ye turn unto me and keep my commandments and do them; though there were of you cast out unto the uttermost part of the heavens, [yet] will I gather them from there and will bring them unto the place that I have chosen to cause my name to dwell there.
Now these [are] thy servants and thy people, whom thou hast ransomed with thy great power and with thy strong hand.
O Lord, I beseech thee, let now thine ear be attentive to the prayer of thy servant and to the prayer of thy servants who desire to fear thy name; and prosper, I pray thee, thy servant this day, and grant him grace before this man. For I was the king's cupbearer.:

A good name [is] better than precious ointment and the day of death than the day of one's birth.
[It is] better to go to the house of mourning than to go to the house of feasting, for that [is] the end of all men; and the living will lay [it] to his heart.
Sorrow [is] better than laughter; for by the sadness of the countenance the heart is made whole.
The heart of the wise [is] in the house of mourning, but the heart of fools [is] in the house of pleasure.
[It is] better to hear the rebuke of the wise than to hear the song of fools.
The laughter of the fool [is] as the crackling of thorns under a pot, and this [also (the laughter or prosperity of the fool) is] vanity.
Surely oppression makes a wise man mad, and a gift destroys the heart.
Better [is] the end of a thing than its beginning, [and] he who has suffered in spirit [is] better than the proud in spirit.
Do not be hasty in thy spirit to be angry, for anger rests in the bosom of fools.
Never say, What is [the cause] that the former days were better than these? for thou dost not enquire wisely concerning this.
Knowledge [is] good with an inheritance and [is] the excellency of those that see the sun.
For knowledge [is] a defence, [and] money [is] a defence; but wisdom excels in [that] it gives life to those that have it.
Consider the work of God; for who can make straight that which [he] has twisted?
In the day of good enjoy that which is good, but in the day of adversity open your [eyes and learn]: God also has made the one [(the day of adversity)] before the other, to the end that man should find nothing after him.
All [things] have I seen in the days of my vanity: there is a just [man] that perishes for his righteousness, and there is a wicked [man] that prolongs [his days] by his wickedness.
Do not be too legalistic; neither make thyself over wise [in thine own eyes]: why should thou destroy thyself?
Do not be hasty [to] condemn, neither be thou foolish: why should thou die in the midst of thy labours?
[It is] good that thou should take hold of this; and also from the other not withdraw thy hand; for he that fears God shall come through with everything.
Wisdom strengthens the wise more than ten mighty [men] who are in the city.
For surely [there is] not a just man upon earth that in doing good does not sin.

That which has been is far off and that [which is] exceeding deep, who can find it out?
I applied my heart to know and to search and to seek out wisdom and the reason [of things], and to know the wickedness of folly and the madness of error;

Behold, this I have found, saith the preacher, [weighing things] one by one to find out the answer,

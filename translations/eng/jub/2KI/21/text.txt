Manasseh [was] twelve years old when he began to reign and reigned fifty-five years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name [was] Hephzibah.
And he did [that which was] evil in the sight of the LORD, after the abominations of the Gentiles, whom the LORD cast out before the sons of Israel.
For he built up again the high places which Hezekiah, his father, had destroyed, and he raised up altars for Baal and made a grove, as Ahab, king of Israel, had done; and he worshipped all the host of heaven and served those things.
Likewise, he built altars in the house of the LORD, of which the LORD had said, In Jerusalem I will put my name.
And he built altars for all the host of heaven in the two courts of the house of the LORD.
And he made his son pass through the fire and observed times and used enchantments and dealt with spiritists and diviners and multiplied much wickedness in the sight of the LORD, to provoke [him] to anger.
And he set a graven image of the grove that he had made in the house, of which the LORD had said to David and to Solomon, his son, In this house and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen out of all tribes of Israel, will I put my name for ever;
neither will I make the feet of Israel move any more out of the land which I gave their fathers, only if they will observe to do according to all that I have commanded them and according to all the law that my servant Moses commanded them.
But they did not hearken, and Manasseh caused them to err and to do more evil than did the Gentiles whom the LORD destroyed before the sons of Israel.
And the LORD spoke by his servants, the prophets, saying,
Because Manasseh, king of Judah, has done these abominations [and] has done more evil than all that the Amorites did, who [were] before him and has also made Judah sin with his idols;
therefore, thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Behold, I [am] bringing [such] evil upon Jerusalem and Judah, that whoever hears of it, both his ears shall tingle.
And I will stretch over Jerusalem the line of Samaria and the plummet of the house of Ahab; and I will wipe Jerusalem as [a man] wipes a dish, wiping [it] and turning [it] upside down.
And I will forsake the remnant of my inheritance and deliver them into the hand of their enemies, and they shall become a prey and a spoil to all their enemies
because they have done [that which was] evil in my sight and have provoked me to anger since the day their fathers came forth out of Egypt, even unto this day.
Moreover, Manasseh shed innocent blood very much until he had filled Jerusalem from one end to another besides his sin with which he made Judah sin so that they would do [that which was] evil in the sight of the LORD.
Now the rest of the acts of Manasseh and all that he did and his sin with which he sinned, [are] they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?
And Manasseh slept with his fathers and was buried in the garden of his own house, in the garden of Uzza; and Amon his son reigned in his stead.
Amon [was] twenty-two years old when he began to reign, and he reigned two years in Jerusalem. His mother's name [was] Meshullemeth, the daughter of Haruz of Jotbah.
And he did [that which was] evil in the sight of the LORD, as his father Manasseh had done.
And he walked in all the way that his father walked in and served the idols that his father had served and worshipped them;
and he forsook the LORD God of his fathers and did not walk in the way of the LORD.
And the servants of Amon conspired against him and slew the king in his own house.
[Then] the people of the land slew all those that had conspired against King Amon, and the people of the land made Josiah, his son, king in his stead.
Now the rest of the acts of Amon which he did, [are] they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?
And he was buried in his sepulchre in the garden of Uzza, and Josiah, his son, reigned in his stead.:

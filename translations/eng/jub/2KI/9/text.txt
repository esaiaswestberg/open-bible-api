Then Elisha, the prophet, called one of the sons of the prophets and said unto him, Gird up thy loins and take this flask of oil in thy hand and go to Ramothgilead.
And when thou comest there, thou shalt see Jehu, the son of Jehoshaphat the son of Nimshi, there; go in and make him arise up from among his brethren and take him to an inner chamber.
Then take the flask of oil and pour [it] on his head and say, Thus hath the LORD said, I have anointed thee king over Israel. Then open the door and flee and do not tarry.
So the young man, the servant of the prophet, went to Ramothgilead.
And when he came, behold, the captains of the host [were] sitting, and he said, I have an errand to thee, O captain. And Jehu said, Unto which of all us? And he said, To thee, O captain.
And he arose and went into the house, and he poured the oil on his head and said unto him, Thus hath said the LORD God of Israel, I have anointed thee king over the people of the LORD, [even] over Israel.
And thou shalt smite the house of Ahab, thy master, that I may avenge the blood of my servants, the prophets, and the blood of all the servants of the LORD, at the hand of Jezebel.
For the whole house of Ahab shall perish, and I will cut off from Ahab him that pisses against the wall, he that is shut up as well as he that is left in Israel.
And I will make the house of Ahab like the house of Jeroboam, the son of Nebat, and like the house of Baasha, the son of Ahijah.
And the dogs shall eat Jezebel in the portion of Jezreel, and [there shall be] no one to bury [her]. And he opened the door and fled.
Then Jehu came forth to the servants of his lord, and [one] said unto him, Is there peace? Why did this mad [fellow] come to thee? And he said unto them, Ye know the man and his communication.
And they said, We know not; tell us now. And he said, Thus and thus he spoke unto me, saying, Thus hath the LORD said, I have anointed thee king over Israel.
Then they hastened, and each man took his garment, and put [it] under him in a high throne, and blew the shofar, saying, Jehu is king.
So Jehu, the son of Jehoshaphat the son of Nimshi, conspired against Joram. (Now Joram was keeping Ramothgilead, with all Israel, because of Hazael, king of Syria.
But King Joram was returned to be healed in Jezreel of the wounds which the Syrians had given him, when he fought with Hazael, king of Syria.) And Jehu said, If it is your desire, [then] do not let anyone go forth [nor] escape out of the city to tell the news in Jezreel.
So Jehu rode and went to Jezreel, for Joram lay there. And Ahaziah, king of Judah, was come down to see Joram.
And the watchman, who stood in the tower of Jezreel, spied the company of Jehu as he came and said, I see a company. And Joram said, Take a horseman and send to meet them and let him say unto them, Is there peace?
So one on horseback went to meet him and said, Thus saith the king, Is there peace? And Jehu said, What hast thou to do with peace? Turn behind me. And the watchman gave notice, saying, The messenger came to them, but he does not return.
Then he sent out another on horseback, who came to them, and said, Thus saith the king, Is there peace? And Jehu answered, What hast thou to do with peace? Turn behind me.
And the watchman gave notice again, saying, He also came unto them and does not return, and the pace of him who is coming [is] like the pace of Jehu, the son of Nimshi, for he comes impetuously.
And Joram said, Make ready. And his chariot was made ready. And Joram, king of Israel, and Ahaziah, king of Judah, went out, each in his chariot, and they went out to meet Jehu and found him in the portion of Naboth of Jezreel.
And when Joram saw Jehu, he said, Is there peace, Jehu? And he answered, What peace, so long as the fornications of thy mother Jezebel and her witchcrafts [are so] many?
Then Joram turned his hands and fled and said to Ahaziah, [There is] treachery, O Ahaziah.
But Jehu drew his bow with his full strength and smote Jehoram between his arms, and the arrow went out at his heart, and he sunk down in his chariot.
Then said [Jehu] to Bidkar, his captain, Take him [and] cast him in the edge of the portion of the field of Naboth of Jezreel. Remember that when thou and I went together after Ahab, his father, the LORD pronounced this sentence upon him, saying,
Surely I have seen yesterday the blood of Naboth and the blood of his sons, said the LORD, and I will requite thee in this portion, said the LORD. Now, therefore, take [and] cast him into the portion, according to the word of the LORD.
But when Ahaziah, the king of Judah, saw [this], he fled by the way of the garden house. And Jehu followed after him and said, Smite him also in the chariot. [And they did so] at the ascent to Gur, which [is] by Ibleam. And he fled to Megiddo and died there.
And his servants carried him to Jerusalem and buried him in his sepulchre with his fathers in the city of David.
In the eleventh year of Joram, the son of Ahab, Ahaziah began to reign over Judah.
And Jehu came to Jezreel, and when Jezebel heard [of it], she painted her face and tired her head and looked out of a window.
And as Jehu entered in at the gate, she said, [Had] Zimri peace, who slew his master?
And he lifted up his face to the window and said, Who [is] on my side? Who? And two [or] three eunuchs looked at him.
And he said, Throw her down. So they threw her down, and [some] of her blood was sprinkled on the wall and on the horses; and he trode her under foot.
And he entered in, and after he ate and drank, he said, Go, see now this cursed [woman] and bury her; for [after all] she [is] a king's daughter.
But when they went to bury her, they found no more of her than the skull and the feet and the palms of [her] hands.
And they returned and told him. And he said, This [is] the word of the LORD, which he spoke by his servant Elijah, the Tishbite, saying, In the portion of Jezreel shall dogs eat the flesh of Jezebel.
And the carcase of Jezebel shall be as dung upon the face of the field in the portion of Jezreel so that no one shall be able to say, This [is] Jezebel.:

Then Jacob walked [on] and came into the land of the people of the east.
And he looked and saw a well in the field, and, behold, there [were] three flocks of sheep lying by it, for out of that well they watered the flocks, and a great stone [was] upon the well's mouth.
And all the flocks gathered there; and they would roll the stone from the well's mouth and water the sheep and put the stone again upon the well's mouth in its place.
And Jacob said unto them, My brethren, where are you from? And they said, We [are] from Haran.
And he said unto them, Do you know Laban the son of Nahor? And they said, We know [him].
And he said unto them, [Is] he well? And they said, [He is] well, and, behold, Rachel, his daughter, comes with the sheep.
And he said, behold, [it is] yet high day; neither [is it] time that the livestock should be gathered together; water the sheep and go [and] feed [them].
And they said, We cannot until all the flocks are gathered together and [until] they roll the stone from the well's mouth, that we may water the sheep.
And while he yet spoke with them, Rachel came with her father's sheep, for she was the pastor.
And it came to pass when Jacob saw Rachel, the daughter of Laban, his mother's brother, and the sheep of Laban, his mother's brother, that Jacob went near and rolled the stone from the well's mouth and watered the flock of Laban, his mother's brother.
And Jacob kissed Rachel and lifted up his voice and wept.
And Jacob told Rachel that he [was of] her father's brethren, and that he [was] Rebekah's son, and she ran and told her father.
And it came to pass when Laban heard the tidings of Jacob his sister's son that he ran to meet him and embraced him and kissed him and brought him to his house. And he told Laban all these things.
And Laban said to him, Surely thou [art] my bone and my flesh. And he abode with him the space of a month.
And Laban said unto Jacob, Because thou [art of] my brethren, should thou therefore serve me for nothing? Tell me, what [shall] thy wages [be]?
And Laban had two daughters: the name of the elder [was] Leah, and the name of the younger [was] Rachel.
Leah [was] tender eyed; but Rachel was beautiful and well favoured.
And Jacob loved Rachel and said, I will serve thee seven years for Rachel, thy younger daughter.
And Laban said, [It is] better that I give her to thee than that I should give her to another man; abide with me.
And Jacob served seven years for Rachel, and they seemed unto him [but] a few days, for the love he had to her.
And Jacob said unto Laban, Give [me] my wife, for my days are fulfilled that I may go in unto her.
So Laban gathered together all the men of the place and made a banquet.
And it came to pass in the evening that he took Leah, his daughter, and brought her to him, and he went in unto her.
And Laban gave unto his daughter Leah Zilpah, his maid, [for] a handmaid.
And it came to pass that in the morning, behold, it [was] Leah; and he said to Laban, What [is] this thou hast done unto me? Did not I serve with thee for Rachel? Why then hast thou beguiled me?
And Laban said, It must not be so done in our country to give the younger before the firstborn.
Fulfil her week, and we will give thee the other also for another seven years of service which thou shalt serve with me.
And Jacob did so and fulfilled her week; and he gave him Rachel his daughter to wife also.
And Laban gave to Rachel his daughter Bilhah, his handmaid, to be her maid.
And he went in also unto Rachel, and he loved also Rachel more than Leah and served with him yet another seven years.
And when the LORD saw that Leah [was] hated, he opened her womb; but Rachel [was] barren.
And Leah conceived and gave birth to a son, and she called his name Reuben; for she said, Surely the LORD has looked upon my affliction; now therefore my husband will love me.
And she conceived again and gave birth to a son; and said, Because the LORD has heard that I [was] hated, he has therefore given me this [son] also; and she called his name Simeon.
And she conceived again and gave birth to a son; and said, Now this time will my husband be joined unto me because I have born him three sons; therefore his name was called Levi.
And she conceived again and gave birth a son; and she said, Now I will praise the LORD; therefore she called his name Judah and stopped bearing [children].:

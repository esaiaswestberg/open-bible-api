And it came to pass at the end of two full years, that Pharaoh dreamed: and, behold, he stood by the river.
And, behold, there came up out of the river seven beautiful cows and very fat, and they fed in a meadow.
And, behold, seven other cows came up after them out of the river, ugly and lean-fleshed, and stood by the [other] cows upon the brink of the river.
And the ugly and lean-fleshed cows ate up the seven beautiful and fat cows. So Pharaoh awoke.
And he slept and dreamed the second time; and, behold, seven heads of wheat came up upon one stalk, full and beautiful.
And, behold, seven thin heads, blasted with the east wind sprung up after them.
And the seven thin heads devoured the seven full and beautiful heads. And Pharaoh awoke, and, behold, [it was] a dream.
And it came to pass in the morning that his spirit was troubled, and he sent and called for all the magicians of Egypt and all the wise men thereof; and Pharaoh told them his dreams, but [there was] no one that could interpret them unto Pharaoh.
Then the chief butler spoke unto Pharaoh, saying, I remember my sins today;
Pharaoh was angry with his servants and put me in the prison of the captain of the guard's house, [both] me and the prince of the bakers.
And we both dreamed a dream in one night; we dreamed each man according to the interpretation of his dream.
And [there was] there with us a young man, a Hebrew, servant to the captain of the guard; and we told him, and he interpreted our dreams to us; he interpreted to each man according to his dream.
And it came to pass, as he interpreted to us, so it was; me he restored unto my office, and him he hanged.
Then Pharaoh sent and called Joseph, and they brought him hastily out of the dungeon; and they cut his hair and changed his clothes, and he came in unto Pharaoh.
And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, I have dreamed a dream, and [there is] no one that can interpret it; but I have heard say of thee [that] thou canst hear dreams to interpret them.
And Joseph answered Pharaoh, saying, [It is] not in me; God shall give Pharaoh an answer of peace.
And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, In my dream, behold, I stood upon the bank of the river;
and, behold, there came up out of the river seven cows, fat-fleshed and beautiful in appearance; and they fed in a meadow.
And, behold, seven other cows came up after them, lean and very ugly in appearance, and thin, such as I have never seen in all the land of Egypt for ugliness.
And the lean and ugly cows ate up the first seven fat cows;
and when they had eaten them up, it could not be known that they had eaten them; but they [were] still ugly, as at the beginning. So I awoke.
And I also saw in my dream, and, behold, seven heads came up in one stalk, full and beautiful;
and, behold, seven heads, withered, thin, [and] blasted with the east wind, sprung up after them.
And the thin heads devoured the seven good heads; and I told [this] unto the magicians, but [there was] no one that could declare [it] to me.
Then Joseph said unto Pharaoh, The dream of Pharaoh is one: God has showed Pharaoh what he [is] about to do.
The seven beautiful cows [are] seven years; and the seven good heads [are] seven years; the dream [is] one and the same.
Also the seven thin and ugly cows that came up after them [are] seven years; and the seven empty heads blasted with the east wind shall be seven years of famine.
This [is] the thing which I have spoken unto Pharaoh. What God [is] about to do he has shown unto Pharaoh.
Behold, seven years of great plenty are coming throughout all the land of Egypt.
And there shall arise after them seven years of famine; and all the plenty shall be forgotten in the land of Egypt; and the famine shall consume the land;
and the plenty shall not be known in the land by reason of that famine following; for it [shall be] very grievous.
And that the dream came unto Pharaoh twice, [it is] because the thing [is] established by God, and God will shortly bring it to pass.
Now therefore let Pharaoh find a discreet and wise man and set him over the land of Egypt.
Let Pharaoh do [this], and let him appoint officers over the land and take up the fifth part of the land of Egypt in the seven plenteous years.
And let them gather all the food of those good years that come and lay up wheat under the hand of Pharaoh to feed the cities, and let them store [it] up.
And let that food be stored for the land against the seven years of famine, which shall be in the land of Egypt; and the land shall not perish through the famine.
And the word was good in the eyes of Pharaoh and in the eyes of all his servants.
And Pharaoh said unto his servants, Can we find [such a one] as this [is], a man in whom the Spirit of God [is]?
And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, Forasmuch as God has showed thee all this, [there is] none so discreet and wise as thou [art].
Thou shalt be over my house, and according unto thy word shall all my people be ruled; only in the throne will I be greater than thou.
And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, See, I have set thee over all the land of Egypt.
Then Pharaoh took off his ring from his hand and put it upon Joseph's hand and arrayed him in vestures of fine linen and put a gold chain about his neck;
and he made him to ride in his second chariot; and they cried before him, Abrech [Tender Father-honour this one as a precious father]; and he made him [ruler] over all the land of Egypt.
And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, I [am] Pharaoh, and without thee no one shall lift up his hand or foot in all the land of Egypt.
And Pharaoh called Joseph's name Zaphnathpaaneah, and he gave him to wife Asenath the daughter of Potipherah priest of On. And Joseph went out over [all] the land of Egypt.
And Joseph [was] thirty years old when he stood before Pharaoh king of Egypt. And Joseph went out from the presence of Pharaoh and went throughout all the land of Egypt.
And in the seven plenteous years the earth brought forth by handfuls.
And he gathered up all the food of the seven years, which were in the land of Egypt and laid up the food in the cities, placing in each city the food of the field, which [was] round about.
And Joseph gathered wheat as the sand of the sea, very much, until he left [off] numbering; for [it was] without number.
And unto Joseph were born two sons before the years of famine came, which Asenath, the daughter of Potipherah, prince of On, bore unto him.
And Joseph called the name of the firstborn Manasseh; For God, [said he], has made me forget all my toil and all my father's house.
And the name of the second he called Ephraim, For God, [said he], has caused me to be fruitful in the land of my affliction.
And the seven years of the abundance that was in the land of Egypt were ended.
And the seven years of famine began to come, according as Joseph had said; and the famine was in all lands, but in all the land of Egypt there was bread.
And when all the land of Egypt was famished, the people cried to Pharaoh for bread. And Pharaoh said unto all the Egyptians, Go unto Joseph; what he saith to you, do.
And the famine was over all the face of the earth. Then Joseph opened all [the storehouses] and sold unto the Egyptians; for the famine waxed sore in the land of Egypt.
And all the earth came into Egypt to buy from Joseph because the famine was so sore in all lands.:

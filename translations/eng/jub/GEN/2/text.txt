Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host of them.
And on the seventh day God finished his work which he had made, and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made.
And God blessed the seventh day and sanctified it because in it he had rested from all his work which God created in perfection.
These [are] the origins of the heavens and of the earth when they were created, in the day that the LORD God made the earth and the heavens
and every plant of the field before it was in the earth and all the grass of the field before it grew, for the LORD God had not caused it to rain upon the earth, and neither [was there] a man to till the ground.
But there went up a mist from the earth and watered the whole face of the ground.
And the LORD God formed man [of] the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and man became a living soul.
And the LORD God had planted a garden eastward in Eden, and there he put the man whom he had formed.
And out of the ground made the LORD God to grow every tree that is desirable to the sight and good for food, the tree of life also in the midst of the garden and the tree of knowledge of good and evil.
And a river went out of Eden to water the garden, and from there it was divided into four heads.
The name of the first [is] Pison; that [is] it which compasses the whole land of Havilah, where [there is] gold;
and the gold of that land [is] good; there [is] bdellium and the onyx stone.
And the name of the second river [is] Gihon; this [is] the same that compasses the whole land of Ethiopia.
And the name of the third river [is] Hiddekel; this [is] that which goes toward the east of Assyria. And the fourth river [is] Euphrates.
And the LORD God took the man and put him into the garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it.
And the LORD God commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of the garden thou may freely eat;
but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it; for in the day that thou dost eat of it thou shalt surely die.
And the LORD God said, [It is] not good that the man should be alone; I will make him a help meet for him.
And out of the ground the LORD God formed every beast of the field, and every fowl of the air; and brought [them] unto the man to see what he would call them; and whatever the man called every living soul, that [was] its name.
And the man gave names to every beast, and [to the] fowl of the heavens, and to every animal of the field; but for the man there was not found a help meet for him.
And the LORD God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam, and he slept; and he took one of his sides and closed up the flesh in its place;
and the LORD God built [that] which he had taken from the side of the man into a woman and brought her unto the man.
And the man said, This [is] now bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh; she shall be called Woman because she was taken out of Man.
Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother and shall cleave unto his wife; and they shall be one flesh.
And they were both naked, the man and his wife, and were not ashamed.:

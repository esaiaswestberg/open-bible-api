And it came to pass in [those] days [that] Amraphel king of Shinar, Arioch king of Ellasar, Chedorlaomer king of Elam, and Tidal king of the Gentiles
made war against Bera king of Sodom and against Birsha king of Gomorrah and against Shinab king of Admah and against Shemeber king of Zeboiim and [against] the king of Bela, which is Zoar.
All these were joined together in the vale of Siddim, which is the salt sea.
Twelve years they had served Chedorlaomer, and in the thirteenth year they rebelled.
And in the fourteenth year Chedorlaomer and the kings that [were] with him came and smote the Rephaims in Ashteroth Karnaim and the Zuzims in Ham and the Emims in Shaveh Kiriathaim
and the Horites in their mount Seir unto the plain of Paran, which [is] by the wilderness.
And they returned and came to Enmishpat, which [is] Kadesh, and smote all the works of the Amalekites and also the Amorites that dwelt in Hazezontamar.
And the king of Sodom and the king of Gomorrah and the king of Admah and the king of Zeboiim and the king of Bela (the same [is] Zoar) went out, and they joined battle with them in the vale of Siddim,
that is, against Chedorlaomer the king of Elam and Tidal king of the Gentiles and Amraphel king of Shinar and Arioch king of Ellasar: four kings against five.
And the vale of Siddim [was full of] slimepits, and the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled and fell there; and those that remained fled to the mountain.
And they took all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah and all their provisions and went away.
And they also took Lot, Abram's brother's son, who dwelt in Sodom, and his goods and departed.
And one came that had escaped and told Abram [the] Hebrew, who dwelt among the terebinth trees of Mamre [the] Amorite, brother of Eshcol and brother of Aner; and these [were] confederate with Abram.
And when Abram heard that his brother was taken captive, he armed his tried and experienced [servants], born in his own house, three hundred and eighteen, and pursued [them] unto Dan.
And he and his servants poured themselves out against them by night and smote them and pursued them unto Hobah, which [is] on the left hand of Damascus.
And he recovered all the goods and also brought again his brother Lot and his goods and the women also and the people.
And the king of Sodom went out to meet him after his return from the slaughter of Chedorlaomer and of the kings that [were] with him, at the valley of Shaveh, which [is] the valley of the King.
Then Melchizedek, king of Salem, brought forth bread and wine, for he [was] the priest of the most high God.
And he blessed him and said, Blessed [be] Abram of the most high God, possessor of the heavens and of the earth;
and blessed be the most high God, who has delivered thine enemies into thy hand. And [Abram] gave him tithes of all.
Then the king of Sodom said unto Abram, Give me the persons and take the goods to thyself.
And Abram said to the king of Sodom, I have lifted up my hand unto the LORD, the most high God, the possessor of the heavens and of the earth,
that I will not [take] from a thread even to a shoelatchet; I will not take any thing that [is] thine, lest thou should say, I have made Abram rich,
except only that which the young men have eaten and the portion of the men who went with me, Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre, who shall take their portion.:

Then Joseph could not refrain himself before all those that stood by him, and he cried, Cause everyone to go out from me. And no one stood with him while Joseph made himself known unto his brethren.
And he wept aloud; and the Egyptians and the house of Pharaoh heard.
And Joseph said unto his brethren, I [am] Joseph; does my father yet live? And his brethren could not answer him, for they were terrified at his presence.
Then Joseph said unto his brethren, Now come near to me, I pray you. And they came near. And he said, I [am] Joseph your brother, whom ye sold into Egypt.
Now therefore be not grieved, nor angry with yourselves that ye sold me here, for God sent me before you for life.
For these two years the famine [has been] in the land, and yet [there are] five years in which [there shall] neither [be] plowing nor harvest.
And God sent me before you that you might remain in the earth and that you might be given life by great liberty.
So now [it was] not you [that] sent me here, but God; and he has made me [as] a father to Pharaoh and lord of all his house and a ruler throughout all the land of Egypt.
Make haste and go up to my father and say unto him: Thus saith thy son Joseph, God has made me lord of all Egypt; come down unto me, tarry not.
And thou shalt dwell in the land of Goshen, and thou shalt be near unto me, thou and thy sons and thy sons's sons and thy herds and thy cows and all that thou hast.
And there I will nourish thee, for yet [there are] five years of famine, lest thou and thy household and all that thou hast perish of poverty.
And, behold, your eyes see and the eyes of my brother Benjamin that [it is] my mouth that speaks unto you.
And ye shall tell my father of all my glory in Egypt and of all that ye have seen; and ye shall haste and bring down my father here.
And he fell upon his brother Benjamin's neck and wept, and Benjamin wept upon his neck.
Moreover he kissed all his brethren and wept upon them, and after that his brethren talked with him.
And the fame of this was heard in Pharaoh's house, saying, Joseph's brethren have come; and it pleased Pharaoh well, and his servants.
And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, Say unto thy brethren, Do this: lade your beasts and go, return unto the land of Canaan
and take your father and your households and come unto me; and I will give you the good of the land of Egypt, and ye shall eat the fat of the land.
Now thou art commanded, do this: take wagons out of the land of Egypt for your little ones and for your wives and bring your father and come.
Also regard not your stuff, for the good of all the land of Egypt [is] yours.
And the sons of Israel did so, and Joseph gave them wagons, according to the commandment of Pharaoh, and gave them provisions for the way.
To each one of them all he gave changes of clothing; but to Benjamin he gave three hundred [pieces] of silver and five changes of clothing.
And to his father he sent after this [manner]: ten asses laden with the best of Egypt and ten she asses laden with wheat and bread and food for his father on the way.
So he sent his brethren away, and they departed. And he said unto them, See that ye do not fight along the way.
And they went up out of Egypt and came into the land of Canaan unto Jacob, their father,
and told him, saying, Joseph [is] yet alive, and he [is] lord over all the land of Egypt. And his heart fainted, for he did not believe them.
And they told him all the words of Joseph, which he had said unto them; and when he saw the wagons which Joseph had sent to carry him, the spirit of Jacob, their father, revived:
Then Israel said, [It is] enough; Joseph my son [is] yet alive; I will go and see him before I die.:

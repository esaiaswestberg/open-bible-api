In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.
And the earth was without order, and empty; and darkness [was] upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.
And God said, Let there be light, and there was light.
And God saw that the light [was] good, and God divided the light from the darkness.
And God called the light Day and the darkness he called Night. And the evening and the morning were the first day.
And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters.
And God made a firmament and divided the waters which [were] under the firmament from the waters which [were] above the firmament; and it was so.
And God called the firmament Heavens. And the evening and the morning were the second day.
And God said, Let the waters under the heavens be gathered together unto one place, and let the dry [land] appear; and it was so.
And God called the dry [land] Earth, and the gathering together of the waters he called Seas; and God saw that [it was] good.
And God said, Let the earth bring forth green grass, herb yielding seed, [and] the fruit tree yielding fruit after its nature, whose seed [is] in itself upon the earth; and it was so.
And the earth brought forth green grass [and] herb yielding seed after its kind and the tree yielding fruit whose seed [was] in itself, according to its nature; and God saw that [it was] good.
And the evening and the morning were the third day.
And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the heavens to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs and for appointed times and for days and years;
and let them be for lights in the firmament of the heavens to give light upon the earth; and it was so.
And God made two great lights: the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night; [he made] the stars also.
And God set them in the firmament of the heavens to give light upon the earth
and to rule over the day and over the night and to divide the light from the darkness; and God saw that [it was] good.
And the evening and the morning were the fourth day.
And God said, Let the waters bring forth great quantities of creatures with living souls and fowl [that] may fly above the earth upon the face of the firmament of the heavens.
And God created the great dragons and every living soul that moves, which the waters brought forth abundantly after their nature, and every winged fowl after its nature; and God saw that [it was] good.
And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful and multiply and fill the waters in the seas, and let fowl multiply in the earth.
And the evening and the morning were the fifth day.
And God said, Let the earth bring forth the living soul after its nature, beasts and serpents and animals of the earth after its nature; and it was so.
And God made the beast of the earth after its kind and cattle after their kind and every thing that moves upon the earth after its kind; and God saw that [it was] good.
And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness; and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the air and over the beasts and over all the earth and over every serpent that moves upon the earth.
So God created man in his [own] image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them.
And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful and multiply and fill the earth and subdue it and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the air and over every beast that moves upon the earth.
And God said, Behold, I have given you every grass bearing seed, which [is] upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in which [is] the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for food.
And to every beast of the earth and to every fowl of the air and to every thing that moves upon the earth, in which [there is a] living soul, [I have given] all green grass for food; and it was so.
And God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, [it was] very good. And the evening and the morning were the sixth day.:

If there is a controversy between persons and they come unto judgment and they are judged, then they shall justify the righteous and condemn the wicked.
And it shall be if the wicked man [is] worthy to be beaten the judge shall cause him to lie down and to be beaten in his presence, according to his fault, by a certain number.
Forty stripes he may give him [and] not exceed lest [if] he should exceed and beat him above these with many stripes, then thy brother should be despised before thee.
Thou shalt not muzzle the ox when he treads out [the grain].
When brethren dwell together and one of them dies and has no child, the wife of the dead shall not marry outside unto a stranger; her husband's brother shall go in unto her and take her to him to wife and perform the duty of a husband's brother unto her.
And it shall be [that] the firstborn which she bears shall be raised up in the name of his brother [who] is dead that his name be not blotted out of Israel.
And if the man does not desire to take his brother's wife, then let his brother's wife go up to the gate unto the elders and say, My husband's brother refuses to raise up unto his brother a name in Israel; he will not perform the duty of my husband's brother.
Then the elders of his city shall call him and speak unto him, and [if] he stands and says, I desire not to take her;
then shall his brother's wife come unto him in the presence of the elders and loose his shoe from off his foot and spit in his face and shall answer and say, So shall it be done unto that man that will not build up his brother's house.
And his name shall be called in Israel, The house of him that is barefoot.
When men strive together one with another and the wife of the one draws near to deliver her husband out of the hand of him that smites him and puts forth her hand and takes him by his secret parts;
then thou shalt cut off her hand; thine eye shall not pity [her].
Thou shalt not have in thy bag different weights, a great and a small.
Thou shalt not have in thy house different measures, a great and a small.
[But] thou shalt have a perfect and just weight, a perfect and just measure shalt thou have, that thy days may be lengthened in the land which the LORD thy God gives thee.
For all that do such things [and] all that do unrighteously [are] an abomination unto the LORD thy God.
Remember what Amalek did unto thee by the way when ye were come forth out of Egypt,
how he met thee by the way and smote the hindmost of thee, [even] all [that were] feeble behind thee, when thou [wast] faint and weary and he did not fear God.
Therefore it shall be when the LORD thy God has given thee rest from all thine enemies round about in the land which the LORD thy God gives thee [for] an inheritance to possess it [that] thou shalt blot out the remembrance of Amalek from under heaven; thou shalt not forget [it].:

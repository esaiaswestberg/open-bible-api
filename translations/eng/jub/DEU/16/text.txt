Keep the month of the new fruit, and thou shalt do the passover unto the LORD thy God; for in the month of the new fruit the LORD thy God brought thee forth out of Egypt by night.
Thou shalt, therefore, sacrifice the passover unto the LORD thy God, of the sheep and the cows, in the place which the LORD shall choose to cause his name to dwell therein.
Thou shalt eat no leavened bread with it; seven days shalt thou eat unleavened bread therewith, [even] the bread of affliction; for thou didst come forth out of the land of Egypt in haste; that thou may remember the day when thou didst come forth out of the land of Egypt all the days of thy life.
And there shall be no leavened bread seen in thee within all thy borders for seven days; neither shall [any] of the flesh which thou didst sacrifice the evening of the first day remain all night until the morning.
Thou may not sacrifice the passover within any of thy gates ([or within any of thy towns]) which the LORD thy God gives thee
but at the place which the LORD thy God shall choose to cause his name to dwell in; there thou shalt sacrifice the passover in the evening, at the going down of the sun, at the [appointed] time when thou came forth out of Egypt.
And thou shalt roast and eat [it] in the place which the LORD thy God shall choose, and thou shalt turn in the morning and return unto thy tabernacles.
Six days thou shalt eat unleavened [bread], and on the seventh day [shall be] a solemn feast unto the LORD thy God; thou shalt do no work [in this].
Seven weeks shalt thou number unto thee; begin to number the seven weeks from [such time as] thou shalt begin [to put] the sickle to the grain.
And thou shalt do the solemn feast of weeks unto the LORD thy God; out of the voluntary abundance of thy hand thou shalt give, according as the LORD thy God has blessed thee.
And thou shalt rejoice before the LORD thy God, thou and thy son and thy daughter and thy manservant and thy maidservant and the Levite that [is] within thy gates and the stranger and the fatherless and the widow, that [are] among you, in the place which the LORD thy God has chosen to place his name there.
And thou shalt remember that thou wast a slave in Egypt; therefore thou shalt keep and do these statutes.
Thou shalt observe the solemn feast of the tabernacles seven days after thou hast gathered in [the harvest of] thy threshing floor and thy winepress.
And thou shalt rejoice in thy solemn feast, thou and thy son and thy daughter and thy manservant and thy maidservant and the Levite [and] the stranger and the fatherless and the widow, that [are] within thy gates ([or within thy towns]).
Seven days shalt thou celebrate a solemn feast unto the LORD thy God in the place which the LORD shall choose; because the LORD thy God shall have blessed thee in all thy fruits and in all the works of thine hands, therefore, thou shalt truly be glad.
Three times each year shall all thy males appear before the LORD thy God in the place which he shall choose: in the solemn feast of unleavened bread and in the solemn feast of weeks and in the solemn feast of the tabernacles. And they shall not appear before the LORD empty,
Each man with the gift of his hand, according to the blessing of the LORD thy God, which he shall have given thee.
Judges and officers shalt thou make thee in all [the] gates [of] thy [cities], which the LORD thy God shall give thee throughout thy tribes, and they shall judge the people with just (and righteous) judgment.
Thou shalt not twist that [which is] right; thou shalt not respect persons neither take a bribe, for a bribe blinds the eyes of the wise and perverts the words of the righteous.
Thou shalt follow justice [and] righteousness, that thou may live and inherit the land which the LORD thy God gives thee.
Thou shalt not plant thee a grove of any trees near unto the altar of the LORD thy God, which thou shalt make thee.
Neither shalt thou set thee up [any] image, which the LORD thy God hates.:

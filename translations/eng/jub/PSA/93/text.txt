The LORD reigns; he has clothed himself with majesty; the LORD has clothed himself with strength; he has girded himself: he has established the world also, that it cannot be moved.
From this time on, thy throne shall never be moved; thou [art] eternal.
The rivers have lifted up, O LORD; the rivers have lifted up their voice; the rivers lift up their waves.
The LORD on high [is] mightier than the noise of many waters, [yea], [than] the mighty waves of the sea.
Thy testimonies are very sure; holiness becomes thy house, O LORD, for ever.:

<<To the Overcomer, [A Psalm] of David, the servant of the LORD, who spoke unto the LORD the words of this song in the day [that] the LORD delivered him from the hand of all his enemies, and from the hand of Saul: And he said,>>I will love thee, O LORD, my strength.
The LORD [is] my rock and my fortress, and my deliverer; my God, my strength, in whom I will trust; my buckler, and the horn of my salvation, [and] my high tower.
I will call upon the LORD, [who is worthy] to be praised, so shall I be saved from my enemies.
The pain of death compassed me, and the rivers of Belial made me afraid.
The pain of Sheol compassed me about: the snares of death came before me.
In my distress I called upon the LORD and cried unto my God; he heard my voice out of his temple, and my cry came before him, [even] into his ears.
Then the earth shook and trembled; the foundations of the mountains collapsed and were removed because he was wroth.
Smoke went up out of his nostrils, and fire devoured out of his mouth; coals were kindled by it.
He lowered the heavens and came down; and darkness [was] under his feet.
And he rode upon a cherub and flew: yea, he flew upon the wings of the wind.
He made darkness his hiding place; in his tabernacle round about him [were] dark waters [and] thick clouds of the heavens.
At the brightness [that was] before him his thick clouds passed, hail [stones] and coals of fire.
The LORD thundered in the heavens, and the Highest gave his voice; hail [stones] and coals of fire.
He sent out his arrows and scattered them; he shot out lightnings and destroyed them.
Then the depths of the waters were seen, and the foundations of the world were discovered at thy rebuke, O LORD, at the blast of the breath of thy nostrils.
He sent from above, he took me, he drew me out of many waters.
He delivered me from my strong enemy, and from those who hated me, even though they were too strong for me.
They were ready for me in the day of my calamity, but the LORD was my staff.
He brought me forth also into a wide place; he delivered me because he delighted in me.
The LORD will reward me according to my righteousness; according to the cleanness of my hands he shall recompense me.
Because I have kept the ways of the LORD and did not become wicked [departing] in apostasy from my God.
For all his judgments [were] before me, and I did not put away his statutes from me.
I was perfect before him, and I kept myself from my iniquity.
Therefore the LORD has recompensed me according to my righteousness, according to the cleanness of my hands before his eyes.
With the merciful thou wilt show thyself merciful; with a perfect man thou wilt show thyself perfect;
with the pure thou wilt show thyself pure; and with the perverse thou wilt show thyself adversary.
Therefore thou wilt save the humble people; but wilt bring down high looks.
For thou wilt light my fire: the LORD my God will enlighten my darkness.
For with thee I have scattered armies; and in my God I have overcome walled [defences].
[As for] God, his way [is] perfect: the word of the LORD is precise: a shield to all those that wait in him.
For who [is] God except the LORD? or who [is] a refuge except our God?
[It is] God that girds me with strength and makes my way perfect.
He makes my feet like hinds' [feet] and sets me upon my high places.
He trains my hands for the battle, so that a bow of bronze shall be broken by my arms.
[In the same manner] thou hast also given me the shield of thy salvation: and thy right hand will hold me up, and thy meekness shall multiply me.
Thou shall enlarge my steps under me, and my knees shall not tremble.
I shall pursue my enemies and overtake them: neither shall I turn again until they are consumed.
I shall smite them, and they will not be able to rise: they shall fall under my feet.
For thou hast girded me with strength unto the battle: thou hast subdued my enemies under me.
Thou hast also given me the necks of my enemies that I might destroy those that hate me.
They cried out, but [there was] no one to save [them]: [even] unto the LORD, but he did not answer them.
Then I beat them as small as the dust before the wind: I scattered them as the dirt in the streets.
Thou hast delivered me from the strivings of the people; [and] thou hast made me the head of the Gentiles: a people [whom] I did not know served me.
As soon as they heard of me, they obeyed me: the sons of strangers submitted themselves unto me even [against their will].
The strangers fell away and were afraid in their close places.
The LORD lives; and blessed [be] my rock; and let the God of my salvation be exalted.
[It is] God that avenges me and subdues the peoples under me.
He delivers me from my enemies: yea, thou liftest me up above those that rise up against me: thou hast delivered me from the one who would betray me.
Therefore I will give thanks unto thee, O LORD, among the Gentiles and sing praises unto thy name.
He gives great deliverance to his king and shows mercy to his anointed, to David, and to his seed for evermore.:

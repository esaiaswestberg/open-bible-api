<<To the Overcomer: upon Shoshannim [lilies], for the sons of Korah, Maschil, A Song of loves.>> My heart is overflowing with a good word; I speak of the things which I have done concerning the king; my tongue [is] the pen of a ready writer.
Thou art fairer than the sons of men, grace is poured into thy lips; therefore God has blessed thee for ever.
Gird thy sword upon [thy] thigh, O [most] valiant, with thy glory and thy majesty.
And in thy majesty be prospered; ride upon the word of truth and of humility [and] of righteousness; and thy right hand shall teach thee terrible things.
Thine arrows, [by which] the peoples fall under thee, [penetrate] the heart of the enemies of the king.
Thy throne, O God, [is] eternal and for ever, the rod of righteousness the sceptre of thy kingdom.
Thou lovest righteousness, and hatest wickedness; therefore God, thy God, has anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows.
All thy garments [smell] of myrrh and aloes [and] cassia, out of the ivory palaces, by which they have made thee glad.
Kings' daughters [were] among thy honourable women; the queen stands at thy right hand with a [crown of gold] from Ophir.
Hearken, O daughter, and consider and incline thine ear; forget also thine own people, and thy father's house;
so shall the king greatly desire thy beauty; and bow before him, for he [is] thy Lord.
And the daughter of Tyre [shall be there] with a gift; [even] the rich among the people shall intreat thy favour.
The king's daughter [is] all glorious within: her clothing [is] of wrought gold.
She shall be brought unto the king in raiment of needlework; the virgins her companions that follow her shall be brought unto thee.
With gladness and rejoicing shall they be brought; they shall enter into the king's palace.
Instead of thy fathers shall be thy sons, whom thou shalt make princes in all the earth.
I will make thy name to be remembered in all generations; therefore shall the people praise thee eternally and for ever.:

By the rivers of Babylon, there we sat down, yea, we wept, when we remembered Zion.
We hanged our harps upon the willows in the midst thereof;
when there, those that carried us away captive asked us for the words of the song; [with] our harps of joy [hung upon the willows saying], Sing us [one] of the songs of Zion.
How shall we sing the song of the LORD in [the] land of strangers?
If I forget thee, O Jerusalem, my right hand shall be forgotten.
If I do not remember thee, my tongue shall cleave to the roof of my mouth; if I do not prefer to lift up Jerusalem as my chief joy.
Remember, O LORD, the sons of Edom in the day of Jerusalem; who said, Rase [it], rase [it], [even] to the foundation thereof.
O daughter of Babylon, [who art to be] destroyed; happy [shall he be], that rewards thee as thou hast served us.
Happy [shall he be], that takes and dashes thy offspring against the stones.:

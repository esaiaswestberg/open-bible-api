<> LORD, who shall abide in thy tabernacle? who shall dwell in the mountain of thy holiness?
He that walks in integrity and works righteousness, and speaks the truth in his heart.
[He that] does not backbite with his tongue nor do evil to his neighbour nor take up a reproach against his neighbour.
In whose eyes the vile person is not esteemed; but he honours those that fear the LORD. [He that] swears to [his own] hurt and does not change.
[He that] does not put out his money to usury nor take a bribe against the innocent. He that does these [things] shall never be moved.:

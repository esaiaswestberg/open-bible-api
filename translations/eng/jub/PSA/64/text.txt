<<To the Overcomer, A Psalm of David.>> Hear my voice, O God, in my prayer; preserve my life from fear of the enemy.
Hide me from the secret [counsel] of the wicked, from the insurrection of the workers of iniquity:
Who whet their tongue like a sword [and] bend [their bows to shoot] their arrows, [even] bitter words
That they may shoot in secret at the perfect; suddenly do they shoot at him and fear not.
They encourage themselves [in] an evil matter; they attempt to hide the snares; they say, Who shall see them?
They search out iniquities; they perfect and put into effect that which they have invented in the inward [thought] of each one [of them] and that which they have devised in their heart.
But God shall shoot at them [with] an arrow; suddenly shall they be wounded.
So they shall make their own council and agreements to fall upon themselves; all that see them shall flee away.
And all men shall fear and shall declare the work of God, for they shall understand his doing.
The righteous shall be glad in the LORD and shall become secure in him, and all the upright in heart shall glory [in him].:

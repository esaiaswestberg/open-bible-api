<<To the Overcomer [upon], Do not destroy, Michtam of David, when he fled from the presence of Saul in the cave.>> Be merciful unto me, O God, be merciful unto me: for my soul trusts in thee; and in the shadow of thy wings I will make my refuge until [these] calamities are overpast.
I will cry unto God most high, unto God that performs [all things] for me.
He shall send from the heavens and save me [from] the reproach of him that would swallow me up. Selah. God shall send forth his mercy and his truth.
My soul [is] among lions, [and] I lie [even among] those that are set on fire, [even] the sons of men, whose teeth [are] spears and arrows and their tongue a sharp sword.
Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens; [let] thy glory [be] above all the earth.
They have prepared a net for my steps; my soul is bowed down; they have dug a pit before me, into the midst of which they are fallen [themselves]. Selah.
My heart is ready, O God, my heart is willing; I will sing and give praise.
Awake, my glory; awake, psaltery and harp; I [myself] will arise early.
I will praise thee, O Lord, among the peoples; I will sing unto thee among the nations.
For thy mercy [is] great unto the heavens, and thy truth unto the clouds.
Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens; [let] thy glory [be] above all the earth.:

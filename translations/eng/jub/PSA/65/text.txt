<<To the Overcomer, A Psalm [and] Song of David.>> Praise doth rest in thee, O God, in Sion and unto thee shall the vow be performed.
O thou that hearest prayer, unto thee shall all flesh come.
Words of iniquity overwhelmed me, [but] thou shalt purge away our rebellion.
Blessed [is the man whom] thou dost choose and cause to approach [unto thee] [that] he may dwell in thy courts: we shall be satisfied with the goodness of thy house [even] of thy holy temple.
With tremendous things in righteousness wilt thou answer us, O God of our saving health, [who art] the hope of all the ends of the earth and of those that are afar off [upon] the sea:
Thou art he who doth establish the mountains by thy strength, [being] girded with valour:
He who stills the noise of the seas, the noise of their waves and the tumult of the Gentiles.
They also that dwell in the uttermost parts are afraid at thy wonders; thou makest the outgoings of the morning and evening to rejoice.
Thou dost visit the earth, and when thou hast caused it to want, thou dost greatly enrich it with the river of God, [which] is full of water; thou dost prepare their grain, according to thy will.
Thou dost water its rows abundantly; thou dost settle its furrows; thou dost make it soft with showers [of rain]; thou dost bless its sprouting.
Thou dost crown the year with thy goodness, and thy clouds distill fatness.
They fall [upon] the habitations of the wilderness; and the hills gird themselves with happiness.
The plains clothe themselves with sheep, and the valleys cover themselves with grain; they give shouts of triumph, they even sing.:

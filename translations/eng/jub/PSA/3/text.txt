<> LORD, how are they increased that trouble me! Many [are] they that rise up against me.
[There are] many who say of my soul, [There] is no help for him in God. Selah.
But thou, O LORD, [art] a shield for me; my glory and the lifter up of my head.
I cried unto the LORD with my voice, and [he] answered me out of the mountain of his holiness. Selah.
I laid me down and slept; I awaked, for the LORD sustained me.
I will not be afraid of ten thousands of people that have set [themselves] against me round about.
Arise, O LORD; save me, O my God, for thou hast smitten all mine enemies [upon] the jawbone; thou hast broken the teeth of the ungodly.
Salvation [belongs] unto the LORD; thy blessing [shall be] upon thy people. Selah.:

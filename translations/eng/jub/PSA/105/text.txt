O give thanks unto the LORD; call upon his name; make known his deeds among the peoples.
Sing unto him, sing psalms unto him; speak of all his wondrous works.
Glory in his holy name; let the heart of those that seek the LORD rejoice.
Seek the LORD and his strength; seek his face continually.
Remember his marvellous works that he has done, his wonders and the judgments of his mouth,
O ye seed of Abraham his servant, ye sons of Jacob his chosen.
He [is] the LORD our God; his judgments [are] in all the earth.
He has remembered his covenant for ever, the word [which] he commanded for a thousand generations,
which [covenant] he made with Abraham and his oath unto Isaac
and confirmed the same unto Jacob by decree, [and] to Israel [for] an everlasting covenant:
Saying, Unto thee will I give the land of Canaan, the lot of your inheritance,
when they were [but] a few men in number; [yea], very few, and strangers in it.
When they went from nation to nation from [one] kingdom to another people,
he suffered no man to do them wrong; [yea], he chastened kings for their sakes:
[Saying], Touch not mine anointed and do my prophets no harm.
Moreover he called for a famine upon the land; he broke the whole staff of bread.
He sent a man before them, [even] Joseph, [who] was sold for a servant,
whose feet they hurt with fetters; his soul was laid in iron.
Until the time that his word came, the [spoken] word of the LORD purified him.
The king sent and loosed him, the ruler of the people let him go free.
He made him lord of his house and ruler of all his substance:
To bind his princes at his pleasure and teach his elders wisdom.
Afterwards Israel entered into Egypt, and Jacob was a stranger in the land of Ham.
And he increased his people greatly and made them stronger than their enemies.
He turned their heart to hate his people to think evil against his servants.
He sent Moses his servant [and] Aaron whom he had chosen.
He put the words of his signs in them and his wonders in the land of Ham.
He sent darkness and made it dark, and they did not rebel against his word.
He turned their waters into blood and slew their fish.
Their land brought forth frogs in abundance in the chambers of their kings.
He spoke, and swarms [of flies] [and] lice came within all their borders.
He turned their rain into hail, [into] flaming fire in their land.
He smote their vines also and their fig trees and broke the trees within their borders.
He spoke, and the locusts came and caterpillars without number,
and ate up all the grass in their land and devoured the fruit of their ground.
He smote [also] all the firstborn in their land, the chief of all their strength.
And he brought them forth with silver and gold, and [there was] not one sick [person] among their tribes.
Egypt was glad when they departed, for the fear of them fell upon them.
He spread a cloud for a covering and fire to give light in the night.
[The people] asked, and he brought quails and satisfied them with the bread of heaven.
He opened the rock, and the waters gushed out; they ran in the dry places [and became] a river.
For he remembered his holy word with Abraham his servant.
And he brought forth his people with joy [and] his chosen with singing
and gave them the lands of the Gentiles, and they inherited the labour of the nations,
that they might observe his statutes and keep his laws. Halelu-JAH.:

<<To the Overcomer upon: The silent dove in a distant land, Michtam of David, when the Philistines took him in Gath.>> Be merciful unto me, O God, for man would swallow me up; he oppresses me fighting me daily.
My enemies would daily swallow [me] up, for [they are] many that fight against me, O thou most High.
When I am afraid, I will trust in thee.
In God I will praise his word, in God I have put my trust; I will not fear what flesh can do unto me.
Every day my life is filled with sorrow; all their thoughts [are] against me for evil.
They gather themselves together, they hide themselves, they mark my steps when they wait for my soul.
Shall they escape by iniquity? in [thine] anger cast down the peoples, O God.
Thou tellest my wanderings; put my tears into thy bottle; [are they] not in thy book?
When I cry [unto thee], then shall my enemies be turned back; in this I know that God [is] for me.
In God I will praise [his] word; in the LORD I will praise [his] word.
In God I have put my trust; I will not be afraid [of] what man can do unto me.
Thy promises [are] upon me, O God; I will render praises unto thee.
For [thou hast] delivered my life from death; thou hast kept my feet from falling, that I may walk before God in the light of the living.:

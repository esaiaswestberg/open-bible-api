<<To the Overcomer on Neginoth, Maschil, [A Psalm] of David, when the Ziphims came and said to Saul, Does David not hide himself with us?>> Save me, O God, in thy name and defend me by thy valour.
Hear my prayer, O God; give ear to the words of my mouth.
For strangers are risen up against me, and oppressors seek after my soul; they have not set God before them. Selah.
Behold, God [is] my helper; the Lord [is] with those that uphold my soul.
He shall reward evil unto my enemies; cut them off in thy truth.
I will freely sacrifice unto thee; I will praise thy name, O LORD; for [it is] good.
For he has delivered me out of all trouble, and my eye has seen [his desire] upon my enemies.:

<> I was glad when they said unto me, Let us go into the house of the LORD.
Our feet stood within thy gates, O Jerusalem.
Jerusalem, that one which is built as a city that is well united together
Because the tribes went up there, the tribes of JAH, the testimony to Israel, to praise the name of the LORD.
For there are set thrones of the judgment, the thrones of the house of David.
Pray for the peace of Jerusalem; those that love thee shall be brought into rest.
Peace be within thy walls [and] rest within thy palaces.
For my brethren and companions' sakes, I will now say, Peace [be] within thee.
Because of the house of the LORD our God, I will seek thy good.:

<<[A Psalm] of David.>> Judge me, O LORD, for I have walked in my integrity; I have trusted also in the LORD; [therefore] I shall not slide.
Examine me, O LORD and prove me; melt my kidneys and my heart.
For thy mercy [is] before my eyes, and I walk in thy truth.
I have not sat with vain persons, neither will I go in with hypocrites.
I have hated the congregation of evil doers and will not sit with the wicked.
I will wash my hands in innocency, so I will walk near unto thine altar, O LORD:
That I may publish with the voice of thanksgiving and tell of all thy wondrous works.
LORD, I have loved the habitation of thy house and the place of the tabernacle of thy glory.
Gather not my soul with the sinners, nor my life with those who have blood [on their hands]:
In whose hands [are] wicked devices, and their right hand is full of bribes.
But as for me, I will walk in my integrity; ransom me and be merciful unto me.
I have walked uprightly; in the congregations I will bless the LORD.:

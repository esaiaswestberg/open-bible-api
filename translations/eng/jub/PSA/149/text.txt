Halelu-JAH. Sing unto the LORD a new song, let his praise [be] in the congregation of the merciful.
Let Israel rejoice with his Maker; let the sons of Zion be joyful with their King.
Let them praise his name in the dance; let them sing praises unto him with the timbrel and harp.
For the LORD takes pleasure in his people; he will beautify the humble with saving health.
The merciful shall be joyful with glory; they shall sing aloud upon their beds.
The high [praises] of God [shall be] in their mouth and a twoedged sword in their hand,
to execute vengeance upon the Gentiles [and] punishments upon the peoples,
to imprison their kings with fetters and their nobles with chains of iron,
to execute upon them the judgment written: this shall be glory for all his merciful ones. Halelu-JAH.:

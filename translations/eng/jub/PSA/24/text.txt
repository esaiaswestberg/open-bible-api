<> The earth [is] the LORD'S, and the fullness thereof; the world and they that dwell therein.
For he has founded it upon the seas and established it upon the rivers.
Who shall ascend into the hill of the LORD? or who shall stand in the place of his holiness?
He that has clean hands and a pure heart, who has not taken my name in vain, nor sworn deceitfully.
He shall receive the blessing from the LORD, and righteousness from the God of his saving health.
This [is] the generation of those that seek him, that seek thy face, O Jacob. Selah.
Lift up your heads, O ye gates; and lift yourselves up, ye everlasting doors, and the King of glory shall come in.
Who [is] this King of glory? The LORD strong and mighty, the LORD mighty in battle.
Lift up your heads, O ye gates; lift yourselves up, ye everlasting doors, and the King of glory shall come in.
Who is this King of glory? The LORD of the hosts, he [is] the King of glory. Selah.:

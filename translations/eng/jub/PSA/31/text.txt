<<To the Overcomer, A Psalm of David.>> In thee, O LORD, have I waited; let me never be ashamed; deliver me in thy righteousness.
Incline thine ear unto me; deliver me speedily; be thou my strong rock, for a house of defence to save me.
For thou [art] my rock and my fortress; therefore for thy name's sake thou shalt lead me and guide me.
Thou shalt pull me out of the net that they have laid in secret for me; for thou [art] my strength.
Into thy hand shall I commit my spirit; thou shalt ransom me, O LORD God of truth.
I have hated those that regard lying vanities; but I wait in the LORD.
I will be glad and rejoice in thy mercy, for thou hast considered my trouble; thou hast known my soul in adversities
and hast not shut me up into the hand of the enemy; thou hast set my feet in a wide place.
Have mercy upon me, O LORD, for I am in trouble: my eye is consumed with grief, [yea], my soul and my belly.
For my life is spent with grief and my years with sighing: my strength fails because of my iniquity, and my bones are consumed.
I was a reproach among all my enemies, but especially among my neighbours, and a fear to my acquaintances: those that see me without flee from me.
I am forgotten as a dead man out of mind: I have become like a lost vessel.
For I have heard the slander of many; fear [was] on every side; while they took counsel together against me, they devised to take away my life.
But I trusted in thee, O LORD; I said, Thou [art] my God.
My times [are] in thy hand: deliver me from the hand of my enemies and from those that persecute me.
Make thy face to shine upon thy servant; save me for thy mercies' sake.
Let me not be ashamed, O LORD, for I have called upon thee; let the wicked be ashamed, [and] let them be cut off for Sheol.
Let the lying lips be put to silence; which speak grievous things proudly and contemptuously against the righteous.
[Oh] how great [is] thy goodness, which thou hast laid up for those that fear thee; [which] thou hast wrought for those that wait in thee before the sons of men!
Thou shalt keep them in the secret place of thy face from the pride of man; thou shalt keep them in the tabernacle [protected] from the strife of tongues.
Blessed [be] the LORD, for he has shown me his marvellous mercy in a strong city.
For I said in my haste, I am cut off from before thine eyes; nevertheless thou hast heard the voice of my supplications when I cried unto thee.
O love the LORD, all ye his merciful ones, [for] the LORD preserves the faithful and plentifully rewards the proud doer.
Be of good courage and strengthen your hearts, all ye that wait in the LORD.:

<> LORD, I have called unto thee: make haste unto me; give ear unto my voice, when I cry unto thee.
Let my prayer be set forth before thee [as] incense, the gift of my hands [as] the evening sacrifice.
Set a watch, O LORD, upon my mouth; keep the door of my lips.
Incline not my heart to [any] evil thing, to do works with ungodliness with the men that work iniquity, and let me not eat of their dainties.
Let the righteous smite me in mercy, and let him reprove me: and let not [a] flattering [evil] prince anoint my head, for my prayer [shall] ever [be] against his evil.
Their judges shall be thrown down from strong places; they shall hearken unto my words; for they are sweet.
Our bones are scattered at the mouth of Sheol, as when one cuts and cleaves [wood] upon the earth.
Therefore mine eyes [look] unto thee, O GOD the Lord; in thee is my trust; leave not my soul destitute.
Keep me from the hands of the snare [which] they have laid for me, and from the snares of the workers of iniquity.
Let the wicked fall together into their own nets, whilst I pass on [ahead] forever.:

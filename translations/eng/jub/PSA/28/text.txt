<<[A Psalm] of David.>> Unto thee will I cry, O LORD my rock; be not silent unto me lest, [if] thou be silent unto me, I become like those that go down into the grave.
Hear the voice of my supplications when I cry unto thee, when I lift up my hands toward the oracle of thy holiness.
Do not catch me away with the wicked, and with the workers of iniquity, who speak peace to their neighbours, but evil [is] in their hearts.
Give them according to their deeds and according to the wickedness of their endeavours: give them after the work of their hands; render unto them their desert.
Because they do not regard the works of the LORD nor the operation of his hands, he shall destroy them and not build them up.
Blessed [be] the LORD because he has heard the voice of my supplications.
The LORD [is] my strength and my shield; my heart trusted in him, and I am helped; therefore my heart greatly rejoices; and with my song I will praise him.
The LORD [is] the strength of his people, and he [is] the saving strength of his anointed.
Save thy people and bless thine inheritance; feed them also and lift them up for ever.:

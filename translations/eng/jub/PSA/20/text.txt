<<To the Overcomer, A Psalm of David.>> [Let] the LORD hear thee in the day of trouble; [let] the name of the God of Jacob lift thee up
[and] send thee help from the sanctuary and strengthen thee out of Zion
[and] remember all thy offerings and reduce thy burnt sacrifice to [the ashes] of [burnt] fat, Selah.
Grant thee according to thine heart and fulfil all thy counsel.
We will rejoice in thy saving health, and in the name of our God we will be standard-bearers: [let] the LORD fulfil all thy petitions.
Now know I that the LORD has kept his anointed; he will hear him from the heavens of his holiness with the saving valour of his right hand.
Some [trust] in chariots and some in horses, but we will remember the name of the LORD our God.
They are brought down and fallen, but we are risen and stand upright.
The LORD saves the king; let him hear us on the day when we call.:

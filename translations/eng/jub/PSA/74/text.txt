<<Maschil of Asaph.>> O God, why hast thou cast [us] off for ever? [Why] does thine anger smoke against the sheep of thy pasture?
Remember thy congregation, [which] thou hast purchased of old; the rod of thine inheritance, [which] thou hast redeemed, this mount Zion, in which thou hast dwelt.
Lift up thy feet unto the eternal desolations, unto every enemy who has done wickedly in the sanctuary.
Thine enemies have roared in the midst of thy assemblies; they set up their [own] banners [for] signs.
Renowned, as one on the way to heaven, he who lifted up axes upon the thick trees [for the work of the sanctuary].
But now they break down all the carved work thereof with axes and hammers.
They have set fire to thy sanctuaries; they have defiled the tabernacle of thy name [in the] earth.
They said in their hearts, Let us destroy them at once; they have burned up all the meeting places [of the people] of God in the earth.
We no longer see our [own] banners; [there is] no longer any prophet: neither [is there] among us any that knows. How long [shall this be]?
O God, how long shall the adversary reproach? Shall the enemy blaspheme thy name for ever?
Why dost thou withdraw thy hand, even thy right hand? [Why] dost thou hide [it] in thy bosom.
For God [is] my King from of old, he who works saving health in the midst of the earth.
Thou didst divide the sea by thy strength; thou didst break the heads of the dragons in the waters.
Thou didst break the heads of leviathan in pieces [and] didst give him [to be] food to the people inhabiting the wilderness.
Thou didst cleave the fountain and the river; thou didst dry up mighty rivers.
The day [is] thine, the night also [is] thine; thou hast prepared the light and the sun.
Thou hast set all the borders of the earth; thou hast made summer and winter.
Remember this, [that] the enemy has spoken against the LORD and [that] the foolish people have blasphemed thy name.
O deliver not the soul of thy turtledove unto the beasts; forget not the congregation of thy poor for ever.
Have respect unto the covenant; for the dark places of the earth are full of the habitations of violence.
O let not the oppressed return ashamed; the poor and destitute shall praise thy name.
Arise, O God, plead thine own cause; remember how the foolish man reproaches thee daily.
Forget not the voices of thine enemies; the tumult of those that rise up against thee increases continually.:

<<To the Overcomer upon Gittith, [A Psalm] of Asaph.>> Sing aloud unto God our strength; make a joyful noise unto the God of Jacob.
Take the song and play the timbrel, the harp of joy with the psaltery.
Blow the shofar in the new moon in the time appointed on our solemn feast day.
For this [is] a statute of Israel [and] an ordinance of the God of Jacob.
This he ordained in Joseph [for] a testimony, when he went out through the land of Egypt [where] I heard a language [that] I did not understand.
I removed his shoulder from the burden; his hands were delivered from [working with] clay.
Thou didst call in trouble, and I delivered thee; I answered thee in the secret [place] of thunder; I proved thee at the waters of Meribah. Selah.
Hear, O my people, and I will testify unto thee; O Israel, if thou wilt hearken unto me,
no strange god shall be in thee, neither shalt thou worship any strange god.
I [am] the LORD thy God, who brought thee out of the land of Egypt; open thy mouth wide, and I will fill it.
But my people did not hearken to my voice, and Israel did not love me.
So I gave them up unto the hardness of their heart, [and] they walked in their own counsels.
Oh, if my people would hearken unto me [and] Israel would walk in my ways!
I would soon subdue their enemies and turn my hand against their adversaries.
The haters of the LORD would have submitted themselves unto him, and their time would endure for ever.
And [God] would have fed them also the finest of the wheat, and with honey out of the rock I would have satisfied thee.:

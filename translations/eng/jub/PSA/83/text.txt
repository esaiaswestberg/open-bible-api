<> Do not keep silence, O God; do not hold thy peace, and do not be still, O God.
For, behold, thine enemies make a tumult, and those that hate thee have lifted up their head.
They have taken prudent counsel in secret against thy people and consulted against thy hidden ones.
They have said, Come and let us cut them off from [being] a people that the name of Israel may be no more in remembrance.
Therefore they have consulted together with one consent; they are confederate against thee:
The tents of Edom and the Ishmaelites; of Moab and the Hagarenes;
Gebal and Ammon and Amalek; Philistia with the inhabitants of Tyre;
Assur also is joined with them: they are an arm unto the sons of Lot. Selah.
Do unto them as [unto] the Midianites, as [to] Sisera, as [to] Jabin, at the brook of Kison,
[who] perished at Endor; they became [as] dung for the earth.
Make them and their captains like Oreb and like Zeeb; all their princes as Zebah and as Zalmunna:
Who have said, Let us inherit for ourselves the habitations of God.
O my God, make them like a whirlwind, as the stubble before the wind.
As the fire burns a wood and as the flame sets the mountains on fire
so persecute them with thy tempest and make them afraid with thy whirlwind.
Fill their faces with shame that they may seek thy name, O LORD.
Let them be confounded and troubled for ever; let them be put to shame and perish
That they may know that thou, whose name alone [is] LORD, [art] the most high over all the earth.:

<<To the Overcomer on Neginoth, Maschil, [A Psalm] of David.>> Give ear to my prayer, O God, and do not hide thyself from my supplication.
Attend unto me and hear me: I mourn in my complaint and make a noise
because of the voice of the enemy because of the oppression of the wicked; for they cast iniquity upon me, and in wrath they hate me.
My heart is sore pained within me, and the terrors of death are fallen upon me.
Fearfulness and trembling are come upon me, and horror has overwhelmed me.
And I said, Oh that I had wings like a dove! [for then] I would fly away and be at rest.
Behold, [then] I would flee far away [and] dwell in the wilderness. Selah.
I would hasten my escape from the windy storm [and] tempest.
Destroy, O Lord, [and] divide their tongues, for I have seen violence and strife in the city.
Day and night they go about it upon the walls thereof; iniquity also and sorrow [are] in the midst of it.
Wickedness [is] in the midst thereof; deceit and guile depart not from her streets.
For [it was] not an enemy [that] reproached me; then I could have borne [it], neither [was it] he that hated me [that] did magnify [himself] against me; then I would have hid myself from him:
But [it was] thou, who in my estimation was, my lord and of my own family.
We took sweet counsel together [and] walked unto the house of God in company.
Let them be condemned unto death, [and] let them go down alive into Sheol for wickedness [is] in their dwellings [and] among them.
As for me, I will call upon God, and the LORD shall save me.
Evening and morning and at noon I will pray and cry aloud, and he shall hear my voice.
He has ransomed my soul in peace from the battle [that was] against me, for there were many against me.
God shall hear and bring them down, even he that abides from of old. Selah. Because they do not change, nor do they fear God.
He has put forth his hands against such as be at peace with him; he has defiled his covenant.
[The words] of his mouth were smoother than butter, but war [was] in his heart; his words were softer than oil, yet they [were] drawn swords.
Cast thy burden upon the LORD, and he shall sustain thee; he shall never suffer the righteous to be moved.
But thou, O God, shalt bring them down into the pit of the grave; bloody and deceitful men shall not live out half their days, but I will trust in thee.:

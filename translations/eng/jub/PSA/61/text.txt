<<To the Overcomer upon Neginah, [A Psalm] of David.>> Hear my cry, O God; attend unto my prayer.
From the end of the earth I will cry unto thee when my heart is overwhelmed; lead me to the rock [that] is higher than I.
For thou hast been a shelter for me [and] a strong tower from the enemy.
I will abide in thy tabernacle for ever; I will trust in the covert of thy wings. Selah.
For thou, O God, hast heard my vows; thou hast given an inheritance to those that fear thy name.
Thou wilt add days upon days unto the king's [life]; his years [shall be] from generation to generation.
He shall abide before God for ever; He is aware of mercy and truth [which] preserve him.
So I will sing thy name for ever, performing my vows each day.:

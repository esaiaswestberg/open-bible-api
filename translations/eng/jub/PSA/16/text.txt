<<Michtam of David.>> Preserve me, O God: for in thee I have put my trust.
I said unto the LORD, Thou [art] my goodness: I have no goodness [apart from] thee;
to the saints that [are] in the earth and [to] the excellent: all my delight is towards them.
The sorrows of those [that] hasten [after] another god shall be multiplied; their drink offerings of blood I will not offer, nor take up their names into my lips.
The LORD [is] the portion of my inheritance and of my cup; thou dost maintain my lot.
The lines are fallen unto me in pleasant [places]; yea, I have a beautiful inheritance.
I will bless the LORD, who gives me counsel: my kidneys also instruct me in the night seasons.
I have set the LORD always before me: because [when he is] at my right hand, I shall not be moved.
Therefore my heart is glad, and my glory rejoices: my flesh also shall rest secure.
For thou wilt not leave my soul in Sheol; neither wilt thou suffer thy Merciful One to see corruption.
Thou wilt show me the path of life: in thy presence [is] fullness of joy; in thy right hand [there are] pleasures for evermore.:

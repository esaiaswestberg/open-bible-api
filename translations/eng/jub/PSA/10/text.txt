Why dost thou stand afar off, O LORD? [Why] dost thou hide [thyself] in times of trouble?
The wicked in [his] pride persecutes the poor; let them be taken in the devices that they have imagined.
For the wicked boasts of his heart's desire and blesses the covetous, [whom] the LORD abhors.
The wicked, through the pride of his countenance, does not seek [after God]: God [is] not in all his thoughts.
His ways are always grievous; thy judgments [are] far above out of his sight; [as for] all his enemies, he puffs at them.
He has said in his heart, I shall not be moved, for [I shall] never [be] in adversity.
His mouth is full of cursing and deceit and fraud: under his tongue [is] mischief and vanity.
He sits in the lurking places of the villages: in the secret places he murders the innocent: his eyes are secretly set against the poor.
He lies in wait secretly as a lion in his den: he lies in wait to catch the poor: he catches the poor when he draws him into his net.
He crouches [and] hides himself, and many are those who fall under his power.
He has said in his heart, God has forgotten; he hides his face; he will never see [it].
Arise, O LORD; O God, lift up thine hand; forget not the humble.
In what does the wicked irritate God? He has said in his heart, Thou wilt not require [accountability].
Thou hast seen [it], for thou dost behold mischief and spite to requite [it] with thy hand: the poor commits himself unto thee; thou art the helper of the fatherless.
Break thou the arm of the wicked and the evil [man]; seek out his wickedness [until] thou find none.
The LORD [is] King for ever and ever; the Gentiles are perished out of his land.
LORD, thou hast heard the desire of the humble: thou wilt prepare their heart; thou wilt cause thine ear to hear:
to judge the fatherless and the oppressed that the man of the earth may no longer oppress.:

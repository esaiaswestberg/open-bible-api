<<To the Overcomer: for the sons of Korah, A Song upon Alamoth.>> God [is] our refuge and strength, a very present help in tribulation.
Therefore we will not fear, though the earth be removed and though the mountains be carried into the midst of the sea,
[though] the waters thereof roar [and] be troubled, [though] the mountains shake with the violence thereof. Selah.
[There is] a river, the streams of which shall make glad the city of God, the sanctuary of the tents of the most High.
God [is] in the midst of her; she shall not be moved; God shall help her, as the morning dawns.
The Gentiles raged, the kingdoms were moved; he uttered his voice, the earth melted.
The LORD of the hosts [is] with us; the God of Jacob [is] our refuge. Selah.
Come, behold the works of the LORD, what desolations he has made in the earth.
He makes wars to cease unto the end of the earth; he breaks the bow and cuts the spear in sunder; he burns the chariot in the fire.
Be still, and know that I [am] God; I will be exalted in the Gentiles, I will be exalted in the earth.
The LORD of the hosts [is] with us; the God of Jacob [is] our refuge. Selah.:

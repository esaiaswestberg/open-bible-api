<<To the Overcomer, A Psalm of David, when Nathan the prophet came unto him, after he had gone in to Bathsheba.>> Have mercy upon me, O God, according to thy mercy; according unto the multitude of thy compassion eradicate my rebellion.
Wash me thoroughly from my iniquity and cleanse me from my sin.
For I acknowledge my rebellion; and my sin [is] ever before me.
Against thee, against thee only, have I sinned and done [this] evil in thy sight that thou be declared just in thy word [and] pure in thy judgment.
Behold, the pain of [my] iniquity has caused me to writhe; my mother conceived me so that sin might be removed from me.
Behold, thou dost desire truth in the inward parts, and in the secret [things] thou hast made me to know wisdom.
Remove the sin in me with hyssop, and I shall be clean; wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.
Make me to hear joy and gladness [that] the bones [which] thou hast broken may rejoice.
Hide thy face from my sins and eradicate all my iniquities.
Create in me a clean heart, O God, and renew a right spirit within me.
Cast me not away from thy presence and take not thy Holy Spirit from me.
Restore unto me the joy of thy saving health, and [thy] spirit of liberty shall uphold me.
[Then] I will teach transgressors thy ways, and sinners shall be converted unto thee.
Deliver me from bloodguiltiness, O God, thou God of my salvation, [and] my tongue shall sing aloud of thy righteousness.
O Lord, open my lips; and my mouth shall show forth thy praise.
For thou dost not desire sacrifice [or] else would I give [it]; thou dost not delight in burnt offering.
The sacrifices of God [are] a broken spirit: a broken and a contrite heart, O God, thou wilt not despise.
Do good in thy good pleasure unto Zion; build thou the walls of Jerusalem.
Then thou shalt be pleased with the sacrifices of righteousness, the burnt offering, the offering that has been totally consumed by the fire; then shall they offer bullocks upon thine altar.:

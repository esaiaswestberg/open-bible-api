A Song of degrees. LORD, remember David [and] all his afflictions:
How he swore unto the LORD [and] vowed unto the mighty [God] of Jacob;
surely I will not come into the habitation of my house nor go up into my bed,
I will not give sleep to my eyes [or] slumber to my eyelids,
until I find out a place for the LORD, a habitation for the mighty [God] of Jacob.
Behold, we heard of her in Ephratah; we found her in the fields of the wood.
We will go into his tents; we will worship at his footstool.
Arise, O LORD, into thy rest; thou, and the ark of thy strength.
Thy priests are clothed with righteousness, and thy merciful ones shout for joy.
For the love of thy servant David, do not turn away thy face from thine anointed.
The LORD has sworn truth unto David; he will not turn from it; Of the fruit of thy body I will set upon thy throne.
If thy sons will keep my covenant and my testimony that I shall teach them, their sons shall also sit upon thy throne for ever.
For the LORD has chosen Zion; he has desired [her] for his habitation.
This [shall be] my rest for ever; here I will dwell; for I have desired her.
I will abundantly bless her provision; I will satisfy her poor with bread.
I will also clothe her priests with saving health, and her merciful ones shall shout aloud for joy.
There will I make the horn of David to bud; I have ordained a lamp for my anointed.
His enemies I will clothe with shame, but upon himself shall his crown blossom.:

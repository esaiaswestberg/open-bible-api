<<To the Overcomer, A Psalm for the sons of Korah.>> LORD, thou hast been favourable unto thy land; thou hast brought back the captivity of Jacob.
Thou hast forgiven the iniquity of thy people; thou hast covered all their sin. Selah.
Thou hast taken away all thy wrath; thou hast turned [thyself] from the fierceness of thine anger.
Turn us, O God our saving health and cause thine anger toward us to cease.
Wilt thou be angry with us for ever? wilt thou extend thine anger from generation to generation?
Wilt thou not give us life again that thy people may rejoice in thee?
Show us thy mercy, O LORD, and grant us thy saving health.
I will hear what God the LORD will speak, for he will speak peace unto his people and to his saints, that they not turn again to folly.
Surely his saving health [is] near those that fear him, that glory may dwell in our land.
Mercy and truth are met together; righteousness and peace have kissed [each other].
Truth shall spring out of the earth, and righteousness shall look down from the heavens.
The LORD shall give [that which is] good, and our land shall bring forth her fruit.
Righteousness shall go before him and shall set his steps in the way.:

<<To the Overcomer upon Aijeleth Shahar, A Psalm of David.>> My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me? [why art thou so] far from helping me [and from] the words of my cry?
O my God, I cry in the daytime, but thou hearest not; and in the night season, and am not silent.
But thou [art] holy, O [thou] that inhabitest [in the midst of] the praises of Israel.
Our fathers trusted in thee: they trusted, and thou didst deliver them.
They cried unto thee and were delivered: they trusted in thee and were not confounded.
But I [am] a worm, and no man; a reproach of men and despised of the people.
All those that see me laugh me to scorn: they shoot out the lip, they shake the head, [saying],
Turn him over to the LORD, [let him] deliver him, [let him] save him, seeing he delighted in him.
But thou [art] he that took me out of the womb; thou hast made me wait [upon thee] since I was upon my mother's breasts.
I was cast upon thee from the womb; thou [art] my God from my mother's belly.
Be not far from me; for trouble [is] near; for [there is] no one to help.
Many bulls have compassed me: strong [bulls] of Bashan have beset me round [about].
They opened their mouth upon me [as] a ravening and a roaring lion.
I am poured out like water, and all my bones are out of joint: my heart is like wax; it is melted in the midst of my bowels.
My strength is dried up like a potsherd; and my tongue cleaves to my jaws; and thou hast brought me into the dust of death.
For dogs have compassed me: the assembly of the wicked have inclosed me: they pierced my hands and my feet.
I may count all my bones: they look [and] stare upon me.
They part my garments among them and cast lots upon my vesture.
But be not thou far from me, O LORD: O my strength, haste thee to help me.
Deliver my soul from the sword; my life from the power of the dog.
Save me from the lion's mouth and from the horns of the unicorns.
I will declare thy name unto my brethren; in the midst of the congregation I will praise thee.
Ye that fear the LORD, praise him; all ye the seed of Jacob, glorify him; and fear him, all ye the seed of Israel.
For he has not despised nor abhorred the affliction of the poor [in spirit]; neither has he hid his face from him, but when he cried unto him, he heard.
My praise [shall be] of thee in the great congregation; I will pay my vows before those that fear him.
The poor shall eat and be satisfied: those that seek him shall praise the LORD; your heart shall live for ever.
All the ends of the earth shall remember and turn unto the LORD; and all the families of the Gentiles shall worship before thee.
For the kingdom [is] the LORD'S, and [he] shall have dominion over the Gentiles.
All [those that are] fat upon earth shall eat and worship; all those that go down to the dust shall bow before him; and no one can keep his own soul alive.
A seed shall serve him; it shall be accounted to the Lord for a generation.
They shall come and shall declare his righteousness unto a people that shall be born, that he has done [this].:

Rejoice in the LORD, O ye righteous, [for] to the upright praise is beautiful.
Celebrate unto the LORD with harp; sing unto him with the psaltery [and] an instrument of ten strings.
Sing unto him a new song; play unto excellence with joy.
For the word of the LORD [is] right, and all his works [are done] in truth.
He loves righteousness and judgment; the earth is full of the mercy of the LORD.
By the word of the LORD were the heavens made, and all the host of them by the breath of his mouth.
He gathers the waters of the sea together as a heap; he lays up the deeps for treasures.
Let all the earth fear the LORD; let all the inhabitants of the world stand in awe of him.
For he spoke, and it was [done]; he commanded, and it came into being.
The LORD brings the counsel of the Gentiles to nought; he makes the devices of the peoples of no effect.
The counsel of the LORD stands for ever, the thoughts of his heart to all generations.
Blessed [is] the people whose God [is] the LORD; the people [whom] he has chosen for his own inheritance.
The LORD looked from heaven; he saw all the sons of Adam.
From the place of his habitation he looked upon all the inhabitants of the earth.
He fashioned all of their hearts; he considers all their works.
The king is not saved by the multitude of the army; the mighty man does not escape by much strength.
A horse [is] a vain thing for salvation; neither shall he deliver [any] by his great strength.
Behold, the eye of the LORD [is] upon those that fear him, upon those that wait for his mercy
to deliver their souls from death and to keep them alive in the famine.
Our soul waited for the LORD; he [is] our help and our shield.
Therefore our heart shall rejoice in him because we have trusted in the name of his holiness.
Let thy mercy, O LORD, be upon us, according as we have waited upon thee.:

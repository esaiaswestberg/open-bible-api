O sing unto the LORD a new song; sing unto the LORD, all the earth.
Sing unto the LORD, bless his name; show forth his saving health from day to day.
Declare his glory among the Gentiles, his wonders among all peoples.
For the LORD [is] great and greatly to be praised; he [is] to be feared above all gods.
For all the gods of the nations [are] idols, but the LORD made the heavens.
Honour and majesty [are] before him; strength and beauty [are] in his sanctuary.
Give unto the LORD, O ye kindreds of the peoples, give unto the LORD the glory and the strength.
Give unto the LORD the glory [due unto] his name; bring offerings, and come into his courts.
O worship the LORD in the beauty of holiness; fear before him, all the earth.
Say among the Gentiles [that] the LORD reigns; he also has established the world, it shall not be moved; he shall judge the peoples righteously.
Let the heavens rejoice, and let the earth be glad; let the sea roar and the fullness thereof.
Let the field be joyful and all that [is] therein; then shall all the trees of the wood rejoice
before the LORD; for he has come, for he has come to judge the earth; he shall judge the world with righteousness and the peoples with his truth.:

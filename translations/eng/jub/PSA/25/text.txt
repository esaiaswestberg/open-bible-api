<<[A Psalm] of David.>> [Aleph] Unto thee, O LORD, do I lift up my soul.
[Beth] O my God, I trust in thee: let me not be ashamed, let not my enemies triumph over me.
[Gimel] Yea, none that wait on thee shall be ashamed; those which rebel without cause shall be ashamed.
[Daleth] Show me thy ways, O LORD; teach me thy paths.
[He] Cause me to walk in thy truth and teach me: for thou [art] the God of my saving health; I have waited for thee all the day.
[Vau] Remember, O LORD, thy compassion and thy mercies, for they [have been] ever of old.
[Zain] Remember not the sins of my youth, nor my rebellions; according to thy mercy remember me for thy goodness' sake, O LORD.
[Cheth] Good and upright [is] the LORD: therefore he will teach sinners in the way.
[Teth] He will cause the humble to pass through the judgment, and the meek he will teach his way.
[Jod] All the paths of the LORD [are] mercy and truth unto such as keep his covenant and his testimonies.
[Caph] For thy name's sake, O LORD, pardon my iniquity; for it [is] great.
[Lamed] Who [is] the man that fears the LORD? Him shall he teach in the way [that] he shall choose.
[Mem] His soul shall rest in [that which is] good; and his seed shall inherit the earth.
[Nun] The secret of the LORD [is] for those that fear him, and he will show them his covenant.
[Samech] Mine eyes [are] ever toward the LORD, for he shall pluck my feet out of the net.
[Ain] Turn thee unto me and have mercy upon me, for I [am] desolate and afflicted.
[Tzaddi] The troubles of my heart are enlarged; O bring thou me out of my distresses.
[Resh] Look upon my affliction and my pain and forgive all my sins.
[Resh] Consider my enemies, for they are multiplied; and they hate me with cruel hatred.
[Schin] O keep my soul and deliver me; let me not be ashamed, for I put my trust in thee.
[Tau] Integrity and uprightness shall preserve me, for I have waited for thee.
[Pe] Ransom Israel, O God, out of all his troubles.:

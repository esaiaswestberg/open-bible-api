<> Truly God [is] good to Israel, [even] to such as are pure in heart.
But as for me, my feet almost departed [from the way]; my steps had almost slipped.
For I became angry against the foolish [when] I saw the peace of the wicked.
Because [there is] no restraint that would bring about their death, but their strength [is] firm.
They [are] not in trouble [as other] men; neither are they plagued like [other] men.
Therefore they are crowned with pride; they cover themselves with violence [as] a garment.
Their eyes stand out with fatness; they easily obtain the desires of their heart.
They are lawless and speak wickedly [of doing] violence; they speak loftily.
They set their mouth against heaven, and their tongue walks through the earth.
Therefore his people shall return here; and waters of a full [cup] are wrung out to them.
And they say, How does God know? and is there knowledge in the most High?
Behold, these ungodly [men], without being troubled by the world obtain riches.
Verily, in vain have I cleansed my heart and washed my hands in innocency
and been plagued all day long and chastened every morning:
If I should say, I will speak as they [do]; behold, I should deny the generation of thy sons.
I shall meditate that I might understand this; it [is very] hard for me to see.
When I come into the sanctuary of God, [then] I shall understand their end.
Surely thou didst set them in slippery places; in desolation thou shalt cause them to fall.
How they are [brought] into desolation, as in a moment! They have come to an end; they are utterly consumed with terrors.
As the dream of [one] who awakes; [so], O Lord, when thou shalt rise up, thou shalt despise their appearances.
Truly my heart was grieved, and I was pricked in my kidneys.
But I [was] ignorant and did not understand; I was [as] a beast before thee.
Nevertheless I [was] continually with thee; thou hast apprehended [me] by my right hand.
Thou hast guided me with thy counsel, and afterward thou shalt receive me [unto] glory.
Whom have I in heaven [but thee]? And apart from thee [there is] nothing upon the earth [that] I desire.
My flesh and my heart fail; the strength of my heart [is] that God is my portion for ever.
For, behold, those that stray from thee shall perish; thou dost cut off all those that go a whoring from thee.
But [as for me], to draw near to God is good; I have put my hope in the Lord GOD, that I may declare all thy works.:

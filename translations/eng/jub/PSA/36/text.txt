<<To the Overcomer, A [Psalm] of David the servant of the LORD.>> The rebellion of the wicked saith to my heart [that There] is no fear of God before his eyes.
For he flatters himself in his own eyes until his iniquity is found to be hateful.
The words of his mouth [are] iniquity and deceit; he has left off to be wise [and] to do good.
He devises iniquity upon his bed; he sets himself in a way [that] is not good; he does not abhor evil.
Thy mercy, O LORD, [reaches] unto the heavens, [and] thy truth [reaches] unto the clouds.
Thy righteousness [is] like the mountains of God; thy judgments [are] a great deep; O LORD, thou dost preserve man and beast.
How excellent [is] thy mercy, O God! therefore the sons of Adam cover themselves in the shadow of thy wings.
They shall be abundantly satisfied with the fatness of thy house, and thou shalt make them drink of the river of thy pleasures.
For with thee [is] the fountain of life; in thy light shall we see light.
Extend thy mercy unto those that know thee and thy righteousness to the upright in heart.
Let not the foot of pride come against me, and let not the hand of the wicked remove me.
There are the workers of iniquity fallen; they are cast down and shall not be able to rise.:

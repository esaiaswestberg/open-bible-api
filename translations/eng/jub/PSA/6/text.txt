<<To the Overcomer in Neginoth upon Sheminith, A Psalm of David.>> O LORD, rebuke me not in thine anger, neither chasten me in thy hot displeasure.
Have mercy upon me, O LORD; for I [am] weak; O LORD, heal me, for my bones are troubled.
My soul is also greatly troubled; but thou, O LORD, how long?
Return, O LORD, deliver my soul: oh save me for thy mercies' sake.
For in death [there is] no remembrance of thee: in Sheol who shall give thee thanks?
I am weary with my groaning; all the night I flood my bed; I water my couch with my tears.
Mine eye is consumed because of grief; it waxes old because of all mine enemies.
Depart from me, all ye workers of iniquity, for the LORD has heard the voice of my weeping.
The LORD has heard my supplication; the LORD has received my prayer.
All my enemies shall be ashamed; they shall be sorely troubled: they shall turn back [and] be ashamed suddenly.:

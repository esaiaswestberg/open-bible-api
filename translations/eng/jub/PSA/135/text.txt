Halelu-JAH. Praise ye the name of the LORD; praise [him], O ye servants of the LORD.
Ye that stand in the house of the LORD, in the courts of the house of our God,
praise JAH; for the LORD [is] good; sing praises unto his name; for [it is] pleasant.
For JAH has chosen Jacob unto himself [and] Israel for his own possession.
For I know that the LORD [is] great and [that] our Lord [is] above all gods.
Whatever the LORD desired, he did in the heavens and in the earth, in the seas and in all the deep places.
He who causes the clouds to ascend from the ends of the earth, made the lightnings in the rain; he who brings the winds out of his treasuries.
He who smote the firstborn of Egypt, both of man and beast;
sent signs and wonders into the midst of thee, O Egypt, upon Pharaoh, and upon all his servants.
He who smote many Gentiles and slew mighty kings,
Sihon king of the Amorites and Og king of Bashan, and all the kingdoms of Canaan
gave their land [for] a heritage, a heritage unto Israel his people.
Thy name, O LORD, [is] eternal, [and] thy memorial, O LORD, from generation to generation.
For the LORD will judge his people, and he will repent himself concerning his servants.
The idols of the Gentiles [are] silver and gold, the work of men's hands.
They have a mouth, but they do not speak; they have eyes, but they do not see;
they have ears, but they do not hear; neither is there [any] spirit in their mouths.
[Let] those that make them become like unto them [and] every one that trusts in them.
Bless the LORD, O house of Israel; bless the LORD, O house of Aaron:
Bless the LORD, O house of Levi; ye that fear the LORD, bless the LORD.
Blessed be the LORD out of Zion who dwells at Jerusalem. Halelu-JAH.:

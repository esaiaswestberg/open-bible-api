<<To the Overcomer upon Shushaneduth, Michtam of David, to teach; when he strove with Aramnaharaim and with Aramzobah, when Joab returned and smote of Edom in the valley of salt twelve thousand.>> O God, thou hast cast us off, thou hast scattered us; thou hast been displeased; O turn thyself to us again.
Thou hast made the earth to tremble; thou hast broken it; heal its breaches, for it shakes.
Thou hast showed thy people hard things; thou hast made us to drink the wine of shaking.
Thou hast given a banner to those that fear thee that they raise up for the truth. Selah.
That thy beloved may be delivered, save [with] thy right hand and hear me.
God has spoken in his holiness; I will rejoice, I will divide Shechem and mete out the valley of Succoth.
Gilead [is] mine, and Manasseh [is] mine; Ephraim also [is] the strength of my head; Judah [is] my lawgiver;
Moab [is] my washpot; over Edom I will cast out my shoe; Philistia, triumph thou because of me.
Who will bring me [into] the strong city? Who will lead me into Edom?
Surely thou, O God, [who] had cast us off; and [thou], O God, [who] did not go out with our armies.
Give us help from trouble, for vain [is] the salvation of man.
Through God we shall do valiantly, for he [it is that] shall tread down our enemies.:

We then, [as] workers together [with him], exhort [you] also that ye have not received the grace of God in vain.
(For he saith, I have heard thee in an acceptable time, and in the day of saving health I have succoured thee; behold, now [is] the acceptable time; behold, now [is] the day of saving health.)
Giving no offense in anything, that the ministry not be blamed,
But in all [things] showing ourselves as the ministers of God in much patience, in tribulations, in necessities, in distresses,
in stripes, in imprisonments, in tumults, in labours, in watchings, in fastings,
in chastity, in knowledge, in meekness, in kindness, in [the] Holy Spirit, in unfeigned charity,
in the word of truth, in the power of God through the weapons of righteousness on the right hand and on the left,
through honour and dishonour, through evil report and good report; as deceivers, and [yet] as men of the truth;
as unknown, and [yet] well known; as dying, but, behold, we live; as chastened, but not killed;
as sorrowful, yet always rejoicing; as poor, yet making many rich; as having nothing, and [yet] possessing all things.
O [ye] Corinthians, our mouth is open unto you, our heart is enlarged.
Ye are not straitened in us, but ye are straitened in your own bowels.
Now for a recompense in the same (I speak as unto [my] children), be ye also enlarged.
Be ye not unequally yoked together with unbelievers, for what fellowship does righteousness have with unrighteousness? and what communion does light have with darkness?
And what concord does Christ have with Belial? or what part do the faithful have with the unfaithful?
And what agreement does the temple of God have with idols? for ye are the temple of the living God; as God has said, I will dwell in them and walk in [them] and I will be their God, and they shall be my people.
Therefore come out from among them, and be ye separate, saith the Lord, and do not touch the unclean [thing]; and I will receive you
and will be a Father unto you, and ye shall be my sons and daughters, saith the Lord Almighty.:

Now I, Paul, myself beseech you by the meekness and clemency of the Christ (who in presence [am] low among you, but being absent am bold toward you)
but I beseech [you] that I [need] not be bold when I am present with that confidence, with which I am esteemed to use against some who regard us as if we walked according to the flesh.
For though we walk in the flesh, we do not war after the flesh
(For the weapons of our warfare [are] not carnal, but mighty through God for the destruction of strong holds),
casting down reasonings and every high thing that exalts itself against the knowledge of God and leading captive every thought into the obedience of the Christ
and having a readiness to avenge all disobedience, when your obedience is fulfilled.
Do ye look on things after the [outward] appearance? If anyone trusts to himself that he is Christ's, let him of himself think this again, that as he [is] Christ's, even so we [are] Christ's.
For though I should glory somewhat more of our authority, which the Lord has given us for edification, and not for your destruction, I shall not be ashamed,
That I may not seem as if I would terrify you by letters.
For [his] letters, they say, [are] weighty and powerful; but [his] bodily presence [is] weak, and [his] speech contemptible.
Let such a one think this, that such as we are in word by letters when we are absent, such [will we be] also in deed when we are present.
For we dare not mix ourselves in with or compare ourselves with some that commend themselves, but they do not understand that they are measuring themselves by themselves and comparing themselves among themselves.
But we will not glory of things beyond [our] measure, but according to the measure of the rule, of the measure which God has distributed to us, to reach even unto you.
For we do not overextend ourselves by reaching unto you; for we are also come unto you with the gospel of the Christ,
Not glorying of things beyond [our] measure in the labours of others; but having hope of the increase of your faith, that we shall be abundantly enlarged among you according to our rule,
to preach the gospel in the [regions] beyond you, without [entering into] the measure of another to glory in that which has already been made ready.
But he that glories, let him glory in the Lord.
For [it is] not he that commends himself [that] is approved, but whom the Lord commends.:

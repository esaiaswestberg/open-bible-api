As snow in summer and as rain in harvest, so honour is not suited for a fool.
As the sparrow in its wandering, as the swallow in its flight, so the curse causeless shall never come.
A whip for the horse, a bridle for the ass, and a rod for the fool's back.
Never answer a fool according to his folly lest thou also be like unto him.
Answer the fool showing him his folly lest he be wise in his own conceit.
He that gives responsibility to one who is not able to carry it out [is like] him that sends a message by the hand of a fool, and he shall drink the damage.
Like unto the way that the [one who is] lame walks, so [is] a proverb in the mouth of the fool.
As he that binds the stone in the sling, so [is] he that gives honour to a fool.
[As] thorns sunk into the hand of one who is drunk, so [is] a proverb in the mouth of fools.
The great [God]that formed all [things] rewards both the fool and transgressors.
As a dog returns to his vomit, [so] the fool returns to his folly.
Seest thou a man wise in his own conceit? [there is] more hope of a fool than of him.
The slothful [man] saith, [There is] a lion in the way; a lion [is] in the streets.
[As] the door turns upon his hinges, so [does] the slothful upon his bed.
The slothful hides his hand in [his] bosom; it grieves him to bring it again to his mouth.
The sluggard [is] wiser in his own conceit than seven men that can give [him] counsel.
He that passes by [and] meddles with strife not [belonging] to him [is like] one that takes a dog by the ears.
As a mad [man] who casts firebrands, arrows, and death,
so [is] the man [that] destroys his friend and says, Am I not in sport?
Where there is no wood, the fire goes out, so where [there is] no talebearer, the strife ceases.
Charcoal for burning coals and wood for fire, and a contentious man to kindle strife.
The words of a talebearer seem smooth, but they go down into the innermost parts of the belly.
Burning lips and a wicked heart [are like] a potsherd covered with silver dross.
He that hates dissembles with his lips and lays up deceit within him;
when he speaks fair, do not believe him, for [there are] seven abominations in his heart.

Whosoever digs a pit shall fall therein, and he that rolls a stone, it will return upon him.
A lying tongue hates [those that are] afflicted by it, and a flattering mouth works ruin.:

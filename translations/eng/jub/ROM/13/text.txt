Let every soul submit itself to the higher powers. For there is no power but of God, and the powers that be are ordained of God.
Whosoever therefore resists the power, resists the ordinance of God, and those that resist shall receive condemnation to themselves.
For the magistrates are not a terror unto those who do good, but to the [doer of] evil. Is thy desire therefore to not fear the power? do that which is good, and thou shalt have praise of the same;

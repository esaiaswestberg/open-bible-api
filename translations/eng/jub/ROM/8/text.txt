So that now, [there is] no condemnation to those who are in Christ, Jesus, who walk not according to the flesh, but according to the Spirit.
For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ, Jesus, has made me free from the law of sin and death.
For that which was impossible to the law, in that it was weak through the flesh, God sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh
that the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us who walk not according to the flesh, but according to the Spirit.
For those that are according to the flesh know the things that are of the flesh; but those that are according to the Spirit, the things that are of the Spirit.
For the prudence of the flesh [is] death, but the prudence of the Spirit, life and peace,
because the prudence of the flesh [is] enmity against God; for it does not subject itself to the law of God, neither indeed can it.
So then, those that are carnal cannot please God.
But ye are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, because the Spirit of God dwells in you. Now if anyone does not have the Spirit of Christ, that person is not of him.
But if Christ is in you, the body is truly dead because of sin, but the Spirit [is] alive because of righteousness.
And if the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwells in you, he that raised up the Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his Spirit that dwells in you.
Therefore, brethren, we are debtors, not to the flesh, to live according to the flesh.
For if ye live according to the flesh, ye shall die; but if through the Spirit ye mortify the deeds of the body, ye shall live.
For all that are led by the Spirit of God, the same are sons of God.
For ye have not received the spirit of bondage to be in fear [again], but ye have received the Spirit of adoption [of sons], whereby we cry, Abba, Father.
For the same Spirit bears witness unto our spirit that we are sons of God,
and if sons, also heirs certainly of God and joint-heirs with Christ, if so be that we suffer with [him] that we may be also glorified together [with him].
For I know with certainty that the sufferings of this present time [are] not worthy [to be compared] with the coming glory which shall be manifested in us.
For the [earnest] hope of the creatures waits for the manifestation of the sons of God.
For the creatures were subjected to vanity, not willingly, but by reason of him who has subjected them,
with the hope that the same creatures shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the sons of God.
For we [now] know that all the creatures groan [together] and travail in pain [together] until now.
And not only they, but ourselves also who have the firstfruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for the adoption, [that is to say], the redemption of our body.
For in hope we are saved, but hope that is seen is not hope; for what a man sees, he does not wait for.
But if we wait for that which we do not see, with patience we wait for [it].
And likewise also the Spirit helps our weakness; for we know not how to pray as we ought, but the Spirit itself makes entreaty for us with groanings which cannot be uttered.
But he that searches the hearts knows what is the desire of the Spirit, that according to [the will of] God, he makes entreaty for the saints.
And we [now] know that unto those who love God, all things help them unto good, to those who according to the purpose are called [to be saints].
For [unto] those whom he knew beforehand, he also marked out beforehand [the way] that they might be conformed to the image of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brethren.
And unto those whom he did mark out beforehand [the way], to these he also called; and to whom he called, these he also justified; and to whom he justified, these he also glorified.
What shall we then say to these things? If God [is] for us, who [shall be] against us?
He that did not spare his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how shall he not also give us all things with him?
Who shall accuse the chosen of God's? God [is] he that justifies [them].
Who [is] he that condemns [them]? Christ, Jesus, is he who died [and], even more, he that also rose again, who furthermore is at the right hand of God, who also makes entreaty for us.
Who shall separate us from the charity of Christ? [shall] tribulation or distress or persecution or famine or nakedness or peril or sword?
(As it is written, For thy sake we are killed all the day long; we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter.)
Nevertheless, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us.
Therefore I am certain that neither death nor life nor angels nor principalities nor powers nor things present nor things to come
nor height nor depth nor any creature shall be able to separate us from the charity of God, which is in Christ, Jesus our Lord.:

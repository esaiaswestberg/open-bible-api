Dare any of you, having a matter against another, go unto judgment before the unjust, and not before the saints?
Do ye not know that the saints shall judge the world? and if the world shall be judged by you, are ye unworthy to judge the smallest matters?
Know ye not that we shall judge angels? how much more [the] things that pertain to this life?
If then ye have judgments of things pertaining to this life, set as judges the most humble who are in the church.
I speak to your shame. Is it so, that there is not a wise man among you? no, not one that shall be able to judge between his brothers?
But brother goes to judgment against brother, and that before the unbelievers.
Now therefore there is certainly a fault among you, because ye go to law one with another. Why do ye not rather suffer [the] wrong? why do ye not rather be defrauded?
But ye do wrong and defraud and [do] this to [your] brothers.
Know ye not that the unjust shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not err: neither fornicators nor idolaters nor adulterers nor effeminate nor homosexuals
nor thieves nor covetous nor drunkards nor revilers nor extortioners shall inherit the kingdom of God.
And such were some of you, but [now] ye are washed, but [now] ye are sanctified, but [now] ye are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus and in the Spirit of our God.
All things are lawful unto me, but all things are not expedient; all things are lawful for me, but I will not be brought under the power of any.
Foods [are] for the belly, and the belly for foods; but God shall destroy both it and them. Now the body [is] not for fornication, but for the Lord; and the Lord for the body.
And God, who raised up the Lord, will also raise up us by his own power.
Know ye not that your bodies are the members of Christ? Shall I then take the members of Christ and make [them] the members of a harlot? In no wise.
What? know ye not that he who is joined to the harlot is one body [with her]? For they shall be, saith he, two in one flesh.
But he that is joined unto the Lord is one spirit.
Flee fornication. Any [other] sin that a man does is outside the body, but he that commits fornication sins against his own body.
What? know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Spirit [who is] in you, whom ye have of God, and that ye are not your own?
For ye are bought with a price, therefore glorify God in your body and in your spirit, which are God's.:

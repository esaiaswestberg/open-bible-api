Now regarding spiritual things, brothers, I would not have you ignore [them].
Ye know that when ye were Gentiles, ye went, even as ye were led, unto the dumb idols.
Therefore I give you to understand, that no one speaking by the Spirit of God calls Jesus anathema and [that] no one can call Jesus Lord but by [the] Holy Spirit.
Now there is dispersal of gifts, but the same Spirit.
And there is dispersal of ministries, but the same Lord.
And there is dispersal of operations, but it is the same God who works all in each one.
But the manifestation of the Spirit is given to each one to profit with.
For to one is given by the Spirit a word of wisdom; to another, a word of knowledge according to the same Spirit;
to another, faith by the same Spirit; to another, gifts of healing by the same Spirit;
to another, [the] operation of miracles; to another, prophecy; to another, discerning of spirits; to another, [different] kinds of tongues; to another, the interpretation of tongues:
one and the same Spirit operates all these things, dispersing to each one his own [gift] as he wills.
For as the body is one and has many members, and all the members of that one body, being many, are one body, so also the Christ.
For by one Spirit we are all baptized into one body, whether [we are] Jews or Greeks, whether [we are] bond or free, and have been all made to drink into one Spirit.
For the body is not one member, but many.
If the foot shall say, Because I am not a hand, I am not of the body, is it therefore not of the body?
And if the ear shall say, Because I am not an eye, I am not of the body, is it therefore not of the body?
If the whole body [were] an eye, where [would] the hearing [be]? If the whole [were] hearing, where [would] the smelling [be]?
But now God has set the members each one of them in the body, as it has pleased him.
And if they were all one member, where [would] the body [be]?
But now [they are] indeed many members, yet but one body.
And the eye cannot say unto the hand, I have no need of thee; nor again the head to the feet, I have no need of you.
For those members of the body, which seem to be weaker, are much more necessary;
and those [members] of the body which we think to be more vile, these we dress with more abundant honour; and those in us who are [more] indecent have more honesty.
For those in us who are more honest need nothing, but God has ordered the body together, having given more abundant honour to that [one] which lacked,
that there should be no contradiction in the body, but [that] the members should have the same care one for another.
And if one member suffers, all the members suffer together; or if one member is honoured, all the members rejoice together.
Now ye are the body of Christ and members in particular.
And God did set certain [ones] in the church: first apostles, secondarily prophets, thirdly teachers, after that faculties, then gifts of healings, helps, governments, diversities of tongues.
[Are] all apostles? [are] all prophets? [are] all teachers? [do] all [have] faculties?
Do all have gifts of healing? do all speak with tongues? do all interpret?
But earnestly pursue the best gifts, and yet I show unto you a more excellent way.:

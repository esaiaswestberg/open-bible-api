And I, brothers, when I came to you, came not with puffed up speech or wisdom to declare unto you the testimony of God.
For I judged not to know anything among you, except Jesus Christ and him crucified.
And I was with you in weakness and in fear and in much trembling.
And my speech and my preaching [was] not with enticing words of human wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power,
that your faith should not be founded in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God.
For we speak perfect wisdom of God, and not the wisdom of this age nor of the princes of this age, that come to nought,
but we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery, [even] the hidden [wisdom], which God predestined before the ages unto our glory,
which none of the princes of this age knew (for had they known [it], they would never have crucified the Lord of glory).
But as it is written, That which eye has not seen nor ear heard neither has entered into the heart of man [is] that which God has prepared for those that love him.
But God has revealed [this] unto us by his Spirit, for the Spirit searches all things, even the deep things of God.
For who among men knows the things of man, except the spirit of man which is in him? Even so no one has known the things of God, but the Spirit of God.
Now we have not received the spirit of the world, but the Spirit which is of God, that we might know the things that God has given us.
Which things also we speak, not in the words which man's wisdom teaches, but with doctrine of the Holy Spirit, jointly fitting spiritual things by spiritual [means].
But the natural man does not perceive the things of the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness unto him; neither can he understand [them] because they are spiritually discerned.
But he that is spiritual discerns all things, yet he is discerned by no one.
For who has known the understanding of the Lord? Who has instructed him? But we have the understanding of Christ.:

Woe to thee that dost spoil, and thou [wast] not spoiled; and dost deal treacherously, and they did not deal treacherously with thee! When thou shalt cease to spoil, thou shalt be spoiled; [and] when thou shalt make an end to dealing treacherously, they shall deal treacherously with thee.
O LORD, have mercy on us; we wait for thee: [thou] wert the strength of thy people in the beginning, be also our saving health in the time of tribulation.
At the noise of the tumult the peoples fled; at the lifting up of thyself the Gentiles were scattered.

The LORD shall be exalted; he who dwells on the heights: [for] he has filled Zion with judgment and righteousness.
And in thy times wisdom and knowledge, and the strength of salvation shall reign: the fear of the LORD [shall be] his treasure.
Behold, their ambassadors shall cry without: the messengers of peace shall weep bitterly.
The highways shall be broken down; the travellers shall cease; he has broken the covenant; he has despised the cities; he does not regard man.

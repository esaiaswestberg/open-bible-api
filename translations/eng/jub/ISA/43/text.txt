But now thus saith the LORD that created thee, O Jacob, and he that formed thee, O Israel, Do not fear, for I have redeemed thee, I have named thee; Thou [art] mine.
When thou dost pass through the waters, I [will be] with thee; and through the rivers, they shall not overflow thee; when thou dost walk through the fire, thou shalt not be burned; neither shall the flame kindle upon thee.
For I [am] the LORD thy God, the Holy One of Israel, thy Keeper; I gave Egypt [for] thy ransom, Ethiopia and Seba for thee.
Because thou wast precious in my sight, thou wast worthy of honour, and I have loved thee.
Do not fear; for I [am] with thee: I will bring thy generation from the east and gather thee from the west;
I will say to the north [wind], Give up, and to the south, Do not keep back; bring my sons from far and my daughters from the ends of the earth
[even] every one that is called by my name, for I have created them for my glory; I have formed them; [yea], I have made them.
Bring forth the people that is blind that have eyes and the deaf that have ears.
Let all the Gentiles be gathered together as one, and let the peoples be joined; who among them can declare this and show us former things? Let them bring forth their witnesses that they may be justified or let them hear and say, [It is] truth.
Ye [are] my witnesses, saith the LORD, and my servant whom I have chosen that ye may know and believe me and understand that I [am] he; before me there was no God formed, neither shall there be after me.
I, [even] I, [am] the LORD; and beside me [there is] no saviour.
I have declared and have saved, and I have showed when [there was] no strange [god] among you; therefore ye [are] my witnesses, saith the LORD, that I [am] God.
Even before the day [was] I existed; and [there is] no one that can deliver out of my hand; [if] I work, who shall hinder it?
Thus saith the LORD, your redeemer, the Holy One of Israel; For your sake I have sent to Babylon and caused fugitives to descend unto all of them and [the] clamour of Chaldeans in the ships.
I [am] the LORD, your Holy One, the creator of Israel, your King.
Thus saith the LORD, who makes a way in the sea and a path in the mighty waters;
[when] he brings forth the chariot and horse, the army and the power; they shall fall together, and never rise; they are extinct; they are quenched as wick.
Do not remember the former things, nor consider the things of old.
Behold, I will do a new thing; it shall come to light quickly; shall ye not know it? I will again make a way in the wilderness [and] rivers in the desert.
The beast of the field shall honour me, the dragons and the owls because I give waters in the wilderness [and] rivers in the desert to give drink to my people, my chosen.
This people I have formed for myself; they shall show forth my praise.
But thou hast not called upon me, O Jacob; but thou hast been weary of me, O Israel.
Thou hast not brought me the animals of thy burnt offerings; neither hast thou honoured me with thy sacrifices. I have not caused thee to serve with an offering, nor wearied thee with incense.
Thou hast bought me no sweet cane with money, neither hast thou filled me with the fat of thy sacrifices, but thou hast made me to serve with thy sins; thou hast wearied me with thine iniquities.
I, [even] I, [am] he that uproots thy rebellions for mine own sake and will not remember thy sins.
Cause me to remember; let us enter into judgment together; declare, thou, that it may be put to thy account.
Thy first father sinned, and thy teachers have transgressed against me.
Therefore I have profaned the princes of the sanctuary and have set up Jacob as anathema, and Israel as a reproach.:

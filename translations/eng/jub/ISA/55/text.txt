Ho, every one that thirsts, come ye to the waters, and he that has no money; come ye, buy, and eat; come, buy wine and milk without money and without price.
Why do ye spend money for [that which is] not bread? and your labour for [that which] does not satisfy? Hearken diligently unto me, and eat ye [that which is] good, and let your soul delight itself in fatness.
Incline your ear, and come unto me: hear, and your soul shall live; and I will make an eternal covenant with you, [even] the sure mercies of David.
Behold, I have given him [for] a witness to the peoples, a captain and teacher to the peoples.
Behold, thou shalt call a people [that] thou knowest not, and Gentiles [that] did not know thee shall run unto thee because of the LORD thy God and for the Holy One of Israel, for he has honoured thee.
Seek the LORD while he may be found; call upon him while he is near:
Let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts: and let him return unto the LORD, and he will have mercy upon him; and to our God, for he will abundantly pardon.
For my thoughts [are] not [as] your thoughts, neither [are] your ways [as] my ways, saith the LORD.
For [as] the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways, and my thoughts more than your thoughts.
For as the rain comes down, and the snow from the heavens, and does not return there, but waters the earth and makes it bring forth and bud, that it may give seed to the sower and bread to the eater:
So shall my Word be that goes forth out of my mouth: it shall not return unto me void, but it shall accomplish that which I please, and it shall be prospered in that for which I sent it.
For ye shall go out with joy, and be returned with peace: the mountains and the hills shall break forth before you into singing, and all the trees of the field shall clap [their] hands.
Instead of the thorn shall come up the fir tree, and instead of the brier shall come up the myrtle tree: and it shall be to the LORD for a name, for an eternal sign [that] shall not be cut off.:

But speak thou the things which are expedient unto sound doctrine,
that the aged men be temperate, venerable, prudent, sound in faith, in charity, in tolerance.
The aged women likewise, that [they be] in behaviour as becomes holiness, not false accusers, not given to much wine, teachers of honesty;
that they may teach the young women to be prudent, to love their husbands, to love their children,
[to be] temperate, chaste, good housekeepers, subject to their own husbands, that the word of God not be blasphemed.
Young men likewise exhort to be temperate;
in all things showing thyself as an example of good works, in doctrine [showing] integrity, seriousness, purity,
sound speech, that cannot be condemned; that the adversary may be ashamed, having no evil thing to say of you.
[Exhort] servants to be subject to their own masters [and] to please [them] well in all [things]; not contradicting;
not defrauding, but showing all good fidelity; that they may adorn the doctrine of God our Saviour in all things.
For the grace of God that brings salvation has appeared to all men,
teaching us that denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live temperately, righteously, and godly in this present world;
waiting for that blessed hope and the glorious appearing of our great God and Saviour Jesus Christ,
who gave himself for us that he might redeem us from all iniquity and purify unto himself a people of his own, zealous of good works.
These things speak and exhort and rebuke with all authority. Let no one despise thee.:

My breath is corrupt, my days are cut off, and the grave is ready for me.
[Now there are] only mockers with me, upon whose bitterness my eye continues [to gaze].
Put up now, give me surety with thee; who [is] he [that] will strike hands with me?
For with these, thou hast hid their heart from understanding; therefore, thou shalt not exalt [them].
He that speaks flattery to [his] neighbour, even the eyes of his sons shall fail.
He has made me a byword of the peoples; and before [them] I have been as a tambourine.
My eyes are dim by reason of sorrow, and all my thoughts [are] as a shadow.
Upright [men] shall be astonied at this, and the innocent shall stir up himself against the hypocrite.
The righteous shall hold on to his way, and he that has clean hands shall be stronger and stronger.
But return all of you, and come now; for I shall not find [one that is] wise among you.
My days are past, my thoughts were broken off, [even] the purposes of my heart.
They changed the night into day; the light [is] short because of the darkness.
If I wait, Sheol [is] my house; I have made my bed in the darkness.
I have said to the pit, Thou [art] my father; to the worms, my mother, and my sister.
And where shall my hope be now? As for my hope, who shall see it?
They shall go down to the bars of Sheol, and together they shall rest in the dust.:

I made a covenant with my eyes; why then should I look upon a maid?
For what reward would God [give me] from above and [what] inheritance of the Almighty from on high?
Is there no destruction for the wicked? And banishment for the workers of iniquity?
Does he not see my ways and count all my steps?
If I have walked with falsehood or if my foot has hastened to deceit,
let me be weighed in a just balance, that God may know my integrity.
If my step has turned out of the way and my heart walked after my eyes and if any blot has cleaved to my hands,
[then] let me sow, and let another eat, and let my offspring be rooted out.
If my heart has been deceived regarding a woman, or [if] I have laid in wait at my neighbour's door,
[then] let my wife grind for another, and let others bow down upon her.
For this is lewdness and iniquity that is proven.
For it [is] a fire [that] consumes unto Sheol and would root out all my increase.
If I had despised the right of my manservant or of my maidservant, when they contended with me;
what then would I do when God rises up? And when he visits, what would I answer him?
Did not he that made me in the belly [also] make him? And did not [the same] one fashion us in the womb?
If I have disturbed the desire of the poor or have caused the eyes of the widow to fail;
or have eaten my morsel alone and the fatherless has not eaten thereof;
(for from my youth the [fatherless] was brought up with me, as [with] a father, and I have guided the [widow] from my mother's womb)
if I have seen any perish for want of clothing or any needy without [a] covering;
if his loins have not blessed me and [if] he were [not] warmed with the fleece of my sheep;
if I have lifted up my hand against the fatherless, even when I saw that they would all help me in the gate;
[then] let my back fall from my shoulder blade, and my arm be broken from its joint.
For I feared destruction [from] God, against whose highness I could have no power.
If I have made gold my hope or have said to the fine gold, [Thou art] my confidence;
if I rejoiced because my wealth [was] being multiplied, and because my hand had gotten much;
if I beheld the sun when it shone or the moon walking [in] beauty;
and my heart has been secretly enticed, and my mouth kissed my hand;
this would also be a proven iniquity; for I should have denied the God that is sovereign.
If I rejoiced at the destruction of the one that hated me or lifted up myself when evil found him;
for I have never even suffered my mouth to sin by wishing a curse upon his soul;
when the servants of my tent said, Oh that we had of his flesh! We would never be satisfied.
The stranger did not lodge in the street, [but] I opened my doors to the traveller.
If I covered my transgressions as Adam, by hiding my iniquity in my bosom;
if I feared a great multitude or did the contempt of families terrify me, that I kept silence, [and] did not go out of the door?
Oh that someone would hear me! Behold, my mark [is], [that] the Almighty will testify for me, even though my adversary had written down the charges.
Surely I would take it upon my shoulder [and] bind it [as] a crown to me.
I would declare unto him the number of my steps; as a prince I would go near unto him.
If my land cries against me and all its furrows likewise complain;
if I ate of its strength without money or have afflicted the soul of its owners;
let thistles grow up unto me instead of wheat and stinkweed instead of barley. The words of Job are ended.:

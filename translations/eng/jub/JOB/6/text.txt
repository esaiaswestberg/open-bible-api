And Job answered and said,
Oh that my grief and calamity were justly weighed and laid equally in the balances!
For it would be heavier than the sand of the sea; therefore, my words are swallowed up.
For the arrows of the Almighty [are] within me; my spirit drinks of the poison; and terrors of God combat me.
Does the wild ass bray when he has grass? Does the ox low over his fodder?
Can that which is unsavoury be eaten without salt? Or is there [any] taste in the white of an egg?
The things [that] my soul refused to touch [before, now] by my sorrow [are] my food.
Oh, that I might have my request and that God would grant [me] the thing that I long for!
Even that it would please God to destroy me, that he would let loose his hand and cut me off!
Then should my comfort grow; I would hold on to sorrow without mercy; for I have not contradicted the words of the Holy One.
What [is] my strength that I should hope? What [is] my end that I should prolong my life?
[Is] my strength the strength of stones? Or [is] my flesh of steel?
Am I not doing all that I can, and [even with all this] I lack the power to do anything?
He that is afflicted [deserves] mercy from his friend; but he has forsaken the fear of the Almighty.
My brethren have lied to me as a brook; they passed away as an impetuous stream,
which was hidden by ice and covered by snow.
Which in the time of heat, they vanish; when they are heated, they disappear out of their place;
they turn aside out of the paths of their way; they go to nothing and perish.
The travelers of Tema looked; the traveling companies of Sheba waited for them.
They were put to shame because of their hope; they came there and found them confused.
Now ye are certainly as they; ye have seen the torment and are afraid.
Did I say, Bring unto me and pay for me out of your substance
and deliver me from the enemy's hand and ransom me from the hand of the mighty?
Teach me, and I will be silent; and cause me to understand in what I have erred.
How forcible are the words of rectitude! But what does your argument reprove?
Are ye not thinking up words of reproof and [throw] to the wind words that are lost?
Ye also overwhelm the fatherless and dig a pit before your friend.
Now, therefore, if ye desire, look upon me and [see] if I shall lie in your presence.
Turn now, and there is no iniquity; return again [to look] for my righteousness in this.
If there is iniquity in my tongue or if my taste cannot discern the torments.:

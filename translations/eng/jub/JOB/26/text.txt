Job answered and said,
How hast thou helped the one who has no power? Hast thou saved with thy arm the one who has no strength?
How hast thou counselled the one that has no wisdom? and [how] hast thou plentifully declared the thing as it is?
To whom hast thou uttered words, and whose is the spirit that comes forth from thee?
Dead [things] are formed under the waters and of its dwelling places.
Sheol [is] naked before him, and hell has no covering.
He stretches out the north wind over the empty place [and] hangs the earth upon nothing.
He binds up the waters in his thick clouds; and the cloud is not rent under them.
He holds back the face of his throne [and] spreads his cloud upon it.
He has compassed the waters with bounds until the end of light and darkness.
The pillars of heaven tremble and are astonished at his reproof.
He divides the sea with his power, and by his intelligence he smites its pride.
By his spirit he has adorned the heavens; his hand has formed the fleeing serpent.
Behold, these [are] parts of his ways; but how little a portion have we heard of him? For the thunder of his power, who shall understand?:

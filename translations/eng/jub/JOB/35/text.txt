Elihu proceeded in his reasoning and said,
Dost thou think this to be right, [when] thou didst say, I am more righteous than God?
For thou didst say, What advantage will it be unto thee? [And], What profit shall I have, [if] I am cleansed] from my sin?
I will answer thee and thy companions with thee.
Look unto the heavens and see; and behold the heavens [which] are higher than thou.
If thou dost sin, what hast thou done against him? Or [if] thy rebellion is multiplied, what doest thou unto him?
If thou art righteous, what shalt thou give him? Or what shall he receive of thine hand?
Thy wickedness [shall hurt] a man as thou [art]; and thy righteousness [shall profit] the son of man.
By reason of the great violence they shall call out; they cry out because of the strength of the many.
But no one shall say, Where [is] God my maker, who gives songs in the night;
who teaches us more than the beasts of the earth and makes us wiser than the fowls of heaven?
There they shall cry, but he shall give no answer because of the pride of those that are evil.
Surely God will not hear vanity, neither will the Almighty look upon it.
For much that thou dost say, he will not look upon it, [submit to] judgment before him, and trust thou in him.
But now, because he has not visited in wrath; nor is it known in great extremity;
therefore, Job opened his mouth in vain and multiplied words without knowledge.:

Then Bildad, the Shuhite, answered and said,
How long [will it be ere] ye make an end of words? Understand, and afterwards we will speak.
Why are we counted as beasts? Are we vile in your sight?
O thou that dost tear thy soul in thine anger; shall the earth be forsaken because of thee and shall the rocks be removed out of their place?
The light of the wicked shall certainly be put out, and the spark of his fire shall not shine.
The light shall be dark in his tabernacle, and his candle shall be put out with him.
The steps of his strength shall be cut down, and his own counsel shall cast him down.
For a net shall be cast at his feet, and he shall walk upon a network.
The snare shall take [him] by the heel, [and] the robber shall prevail against him.
The cord is hidden in the ground and a trap for him in the way.
Terrors shall make him afraid on every side, and his own feet shall drive him away.
His strength shall be hungerbitten, and destruction [shall be] ready at his side.
They shall devour the protection of his skin; the firstborn of death shall devour his members.
His confidence shall be rooted out of his tent, and he shall be brought to the king of terrors.
He shall dwell in his tent, as if it were not his; brimstone shall be scattered upon his habitation.
His roots shall be dried up beneath, and above his branch shall be cut off.
His memory shall perish from the earth, and he shall have no name in the streets.
He shall be driven from the light into the darkness and chased out of the world.
He shall have neither son nor grandson among his people, nor any to succeed him in his dwellings.
Those that come after [him] shall be dismayed at his day, as those that went before were overcome with fear.
Surely such [are] the dwellings of the wicked, and this [is] the place [of him that] does not know God.:

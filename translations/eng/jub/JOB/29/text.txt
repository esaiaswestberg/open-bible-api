Moreover, Job continued his parable and said,
Oh, that I were as [in] months past, as [in] the days [when] God preserved me;
when his candle shone upon my head, and by its light I walked in the darkness;
as I was in the days of my youth, when God was familiar in my tent;
when the Almighty [was] yet with me, [when] my children [were] about me;
when I washed my steps with butter, and the rock poured me out rivers of oil!
When I went out to the gate to judgment, [when] I had my seat prepared in the plaza!
The young men would see me and hide themselves, and the aged would arise [and] stand.
The princes would refrain from talking and lay [their] hand on their mouth;
the voice of the principals would not be noticed, and their tongue would cleave to the roof of their mouth.
When the ears that heard me, called me blessed; and when the eyes that saw me, gave witness to me:
because I delivered the poor that cried and the fatherless who had no one to help him.
The blessing of the one that was ready to perish came upon me; and I caused the widow's heart to sing for joy.
I put on righteousness, and it clothed me as a robe; and my diadem was judgment.
I was eyes to the blind and feet to the lame.
I [was] a father to the needy; and the cause [which] I did not know I searched out.
And I broke the fangs of the wicked and caused their teeth to release the prey.
Then I said, I shall die in my nest, and I shall multiply [my] days as the sand.
My root [is] spread out by the waters, and the dew shall remain upon my branches.
My glory is renewed with me, and my bow is renewed in my hand.
They would hear me and wait, and keep silent at my counsel.
After my words they would not reply, but my reason dropped upon them.
And they waited for me as for the rain, and they opened their mouth wide [as] for the latter rain.
[If] I laughed at them, they did not believe [it]; and they did not cast down the light of my countenance.
I approved their way and sat at the head and dwelt as a king in the army, as one [that] comforts the mourners.:

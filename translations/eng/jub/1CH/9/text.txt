So all Israel were reckoned by genealogies, and behold, they [were] written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah, [who] were carried away to Babylon for their rebellion.
Now the first inhabitants that [dwelt] in their possessions in their cities were thus of Israel, as of the priests, Levites, and the Nethinims.
And in Jerusalem dwelt of the sons of Judah and of the sons of Benjamin and of the sons of Ephraim and Manasseh:
Uthai, the son of Ammihud, the son of Omri, the son of Imri, the son of Bani, of the sons of Pharez, the son of Judah.
And of Shiloni: Asaiah the firstborn and his sons.
And of the sons of Zerah: Jeuel and their brethren, six hundred and ninety.
And of the sons of Benjamin: Sallu, the son of Meshullam, the son of Hodaviah, the son of Hasenuah;
and Ibneiah the son of Jeroham; and Elah, the son of Uzzi, the son of Michri; and Meshullam, the son of Shephathiah, the son of Reuel, the son of Ibnijah;
and their brethren, according to their generations, nine hundred and fifty-six. All these men [were] heads of the fathers in the houses of their fathers.
And of the priests: Jedaiah, Jehoiarib, and Jachin;
and Azariah, the son of Hilkiah, the son of Meshullam, the son of Zadok, the son of Meraioth, the son of Ahitub, prince of the house of God;
and Adaiah, the son of Jeroham, the son of Pashur, the son of Malchijah; and Maasiai, the son of Adiel, the son of Jahzerah, the son of Meshullam, the son of Meshillemith, the son of Immer;
and their brethren, heads of the houses of their fathers, one thousand seven hundred and sixty, mighty men of valour for the work of the ministry of the house of God.
And of the Levites: Shemaiah, the son of Hasshub, the son of Azrikam, the son of Hashabiah, of the sons of Merari;
and Bakbakkar, Heresh, and Galal, and Mattaniah, the son of Micah, the son of Zichri, the son of Asaph;
and Obadiah, the son of Shemaiah, the son of Galal, the son of Jeduthun; and Berechiah, the son of Asa, the son of Elkanah, who dwelt in the villages of the Netophathites.
And the porters: Shallum, Akkub, Talmon, Ahiman, and their brethren; Shallum [was] the head.
And until now in the companies of the sons of Levi these [have been] the porters in the king's gate towards the east.
And Shallum, the son of Kore, the son of Ebiasaph, the son of Korah, and his brethren of the house of his father, the Korahites, [were] over the work of the ministry, keepers of the gates of the tabernacle; and their fathers, [being] over the camp of the LORD, [were] keepers of the entry.
And Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, was the captain over them in time past, [and] the LORD [was] with him.
[And] Zechariah, the son of Meshelemiah, [was] porter of the door of the tabernacle of the testimony.
All these [which were] chosen to be porters in the gates [were] two hundred and twelve when they were reckoned by their genealogy in their villages, whom David and Samuel, the seer, ordained in their set office.
So they and their sons [had] the oversight of the gates of the house of the LORD, [namely], the house of the tabernacle, by wards.
Towards the four winds were the porters, toward the east, west, north, and Negev.
And their brethren, [who were] in their villages, came every seven days in their set times with them.
For these Levites, the four chief porters, were in [their] set office and were over the chambers and treasures of the house of God.
And they lodged round about the house of God, because the charge [was] upon them, and the opening thereof every morning [pertained] to them.
And [certain] of them had the charge of the vessels of ministry, that they should account for them when they were brought in and out.
[Some] of them also [were] appointed to oversee the vessels and all the instruments of the sanctuary and the fine flour and the wine and the oil and the frankincense and the spices.
And [some] of the sons of the priests made the ointment of the spices.
And Mattithiah, [one] of the Levites, who [was] the firstborn of Shallum, the Korahite, had the set office over the things that were made in the pans.
And [other] of their brethren, of the sons of the Kohathites, [were] over the showbread, to order [it] every sabbath.
And of these there were singers, princes of the fathers of the Levites, [who remained] in the chambers [free from other work]; for they were employed in [that] work day and night.
These heads of the fathers of the Levites [were] heads throughout their generations; these dwelt at Jerusalem.
And in Gibeon dwelt the father of Gibeon, Jehiel, whose wife's name [was] Maachah;
and his firstborn son Abdon, then Zur, Kish, Baal, Ner, Nadab,
Gedor, Ahio, Zechariah, and Mikloth.
And Mikloth begat Shimeam. And they also dwelt with their brethren at Jerusalem, next to their brethren.
And Ner begat Kish, and Kish begat Saul, and Saul begat Jonathan, Malchishua, Abinadab, and Eshbaal.
And the son of Jonathan [was] Meribbaal, and Meribbaal begat Micah.
And the sons of Micah: Pithon, Melech, Tahrea, [and Ahaz].
And Ahaz begat Jarah, and Jarah begat Alemeth, Azmaveth, and Zimri; and Zimri begat Moza,
and Moza begat Binea; and Rephaiah his son, Eleasah his son, Azel his son.
And Azel had six sons, whose names [are] these: Azrikam, Bocheru, Ishmael, Sheariah, Obadiah, and Hanan: these [were] the sons of Azel.:

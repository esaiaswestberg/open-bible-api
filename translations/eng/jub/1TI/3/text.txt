The Word is faithful, If anyone desires the office of a bishop [to be a pastor or elder in the church], he desires a difficult ministry.
It is expedient, therefore, that the bishop be blameless, the husband of [only] one wife, vigilant, temperate, of [worldly] affections mortified, given to hospitality, apt to teach;
not given to wine, not hurtful, not greedy of dishonest gain, but gentle, not contentious, not covetous;
one that rules well his own house, having his children in subjection with all integrity;
(for if a man does not know how to rule his own house, how shall he take care of the church of God?)
not a novice lest, being puffed up, he fall into judgment of the devil.
Moreover he must have a good report of those who are outside lest he fall into reproach and the snare of the devil.
Likewise the deacons [must be] honest, not doubletongued, not given to much wine, not greedy of dishonest gain;
holding the mystery of the faith [together] with a pure conscience.
And let these also first be proved; then let them minister, if they are blameless.
The wives likewise [are to be] honest, not slanderers, temperate, faithful in all things.
Let the deacons be the husbands of [only] one wife, ruling their children and their own houses well.
For those that minister well purchase to themselves a good degree and great boldness in the faith which is in Christ Jesus.
These things write I unto thee, hoping to come unto thee shortly
But if I tarry long, that thou may know how it is expedient to behave thyself in the house of God, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and base of the truth.
And without controversy great is the mystery of godliness: God was manifest in the flesh, justified in the Spirit, seen of angels, preached unto the Gentiles, believed on in the world, received up into glory.:

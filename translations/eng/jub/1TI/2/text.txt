I exhort therefore, that, first of all, supplications, prayers, intercessions, [and] giving of thanks, be made for all men,
for kings, and [for] all that are in authority that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and integrity.
For this [is] good and pleasing in the sight of God our Saviour,
who desires that all men be saved and come unto the knowledge of the truth.
For [there is only] one God and likewise [only] one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus,
who gave himself in ransom for all, the testimony of which [was confirmed] at the time,
of which I am ordained a preacher and an apostle (I speak the truth in Christ [and] do not lie), a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and verity.
I desire, therefore, that the men in every place, pray, lifting up holy hands, without wrath and strife.
In like manner also that the women adorn themselves in an honest manner, with shyness and modesty, not with ostentatious hair or gold or pearls or costly clothing
but with good works (as becomes women professing godliness).
Let the woman learn, becoming silent in all subjection.
For I do not allow a woman to teach, nor to usurp authority over a [mature] man, but to be at rest.
For Adam was formed first, then Eve.
And Adam was not deceived, but the woman was deceived in the rebellion;
notwithstanding she shall be saved in childbearing, if she continues in faith and charity and sanctification and modesty.:

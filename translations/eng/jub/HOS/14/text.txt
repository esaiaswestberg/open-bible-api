O Israel, become converted unto the LORD thy God; for thou hast fallen by thine iniquity.
Take with you words, and be converted unto the LORD; say unto him, Take away all iniquity and receive [us] graciously, so will we render the calves of our lips.
Asshur shall not save us; we will not ride upon horses, neither will we say any more to the work of our hands, [Ye are] our gods, for in thee the fatherless finds mercy.
I will heal their rebellion; I will love them freely; for my anger is turned away from them.
I will be as the dew unto Israel; he shall flourish as the lily and cast forth his roots as Lebanon.
His branches shall spread, and his glory shall be as the olive tree, and his smell as Lebanon.
Those that shall sit under his shadow shall return; they shall be given life [as the] wheat, and they shall flourish as the vine; the scent thereof [shall be] as the wine of Lebanon.
Ephraim [shall then say], What have I to do any more with idols? I will hear [him] and gaze upon him; I [will be unto him] like a green fir tree; of me shall thy fruit be found.
Who [is] wise that he might understand this? and prudent that he might know this? for the ways of the LORD [are] right, and the just shall walk in them; but the rebellious shall fall therein.:

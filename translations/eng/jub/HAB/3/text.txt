[A] prayer of Habakkuk the prophet, because of all the ignorance.
O LORD, I have heard thy word [and] was afraid; O LORD, revive thy work in the midst of the times; in the midst of the times make it known; in wrath remember mercy.
God shall come from Teman, and the Holy [One] from mount Paran. Selah. His glory covered the heavens, and the earth was filled with his praise.
And [his] brightness was as the light; he had horns [coming] out of his hand; and there [was] hidden his strength.
Before his face went mortality, and burning coals went forth from his feet.
He stood and measured the earth; he beheld and drove out the Gentiles; and the ancient mountains crumbled, the ancient hills; the ways of the world bowed unto him.
I saw the tents of Cushan as nothing, [and] the curtains of the land of Midian trembled.
Oh LORD, wast thou displeased against the rivers? [was] thine anger against the rivers? [was] thy wrath even against the sea when thou didst ride upon thine horses [and] thy chariots of saving health?
Thy bow was entirely uncovered, and the oaths unto the tribes, eternal word, when thou didst divide the earth with rivers.
The mountains saw thee, [and] they trembled: the overflowing of the waters passed by; the abyss uttered its voice; the deep lifted up its hands.
The sun [and] the moon stood still in their habitation: at the light of thine arrows they went [and] at the shining of thy glittering spear.
Thou didst tread upon the land in wrath; thou didst thresh the Gentiles in anger.
Thou didst go forth to save thy people, to save with thine anointed; thou didst shatter the head of the house of the wicked by uncovering the foundation unto the neck. Selah.
Thou didst strike through with his staffs the heads of his villages, who as a whirlwind attempted to scatter me; their pride [was] as to devour the poor secretly.
Thou didst make a way through the sea for thine horses [through] the heap of great waters.
When I heard, my belly trembled; my lips quivered at the voice; rottenness entered into my bones, and I trembled in my seat, that I might rest in the day of trouble when he comes up unto the people to destroy them.
Because the fig tree shall not blossom, neither [shall] fruit [be] on the vines; the labour of the olive shall lie, and the cultivated fields shall yield no food; the sheep shall be cut off from the fold, and [there shall be] no herd in the stalls:
yet I will rejoice in the LORD; I will joy in the God of my saving health.
The LORD God [is] my strength, and he will make my feet like hinds' [feet], and upon my high places he will cause me to walk victorious in my instruments of music.:

Remember, O LORD, what is come upon us; look, and behold our reproach.
Our inheritance is turned to strangers, our houses to aliens.
We are orphans without father; our mothers [are] as widows.
We have drunk our water for money; our wood is sold unto us.
Our necks [are] under persecution; we are become tired [and] have no rest.
We have given the hand [to] the Egyptians [and to] the Assyrians to be satisfied with bread.
Our fathers have sinned [and are] dead; and we have borne their chastisements.
Servants have ruled over us: there was no one to deliver [us] out of their hand.
We got our bread with [the peril of] our lives because of the sword of the wilderness.
Our skin became black like an oven because of the terrible famine.
They ravished the women in Zion [and] the virgins in the cities of Judah.
Princes were hanged up by their hand; the countenance of the elders was not honoured.
They took the young men to grind, and the children fell under the wood.
The elders have ceased from the gate, the young men from their music.
The joy of our heart is ceased; our dance is turned into mourning.
The crown is fallen [from] our head; woe now unto us, for we have sinned!
For this our heart is saddened; for these [things] our eyes are become dim.
Because of the mountain of Zion, which is desolate, the foxes walk upon it.
Thou, O LORD, [shall] remain for ever; thy throne from generation to generation.
Why should thou forget us for ever [and] forsake us for such [a] long time?
Turn us unto thee, O LORD, and we shall be turned; renew our days as at the beginning.
For in stepping back thou hast rejected us; thou hast become very angry against us.:

And the LORD spoke unto Moses, saying,
Send thou men that they may spy out the land of Canaan, which I give unto the sons of Israel; of every tribe of their fathers ye shall send a man, each one a prince among them.
And Moses by the commandment of the LORD sent them from the wilderness of Paran; all those men [were] princes of the sons of Israel.
And these [were] their names: of the tribe of Reuben, Shammua, the son of Zaccur.
Of the tribe of Simeon, Shaphat, the son of Hori.
Of the tribe of Judah, Caleb, the son of Jephunneh.
Of the tribe of Issachar, Igal, the son of Joseph.
Of the tribe of Ephraim, Hosea, the son of Nun.
Of the tribe of Benjamin, Palti, the son of Raphu.
Of the tribe of Zebulun, Gaddiel, the son of Sodi.
Of the tribe of Joseph, [namely], of the tribe of Manasseh, Gaddi, the son of Susi.
Of the tribe of Dan, Ammiel, the son of Gemalli.
Of the tribe of Asher, Sethur, the son of Michael.
Of the tribe of Naphtali, Nahbi, the son of Vophsi.
Of the tribe of Gad, Geuel, the son of Machi.
These [are] the names of the men whom Moses sent to spy out the land. And Moses called Hosea, the son of Nun, Joshua.
And Moses sent them to spy out the land of Canaan and said unto them, Go up this [way] towards the Negev and go up into the mountain
and see the land, what it [is], and the people that dwell therein, whether they [are] strong or weak, few or many,
and how the land [is] that they dwell in, whether it [is] good or bad, and what cities [there are] that they dwell in, whether in tents, or in strong holds,
And what the land [is], whether it [is] fertile or sterile, whether there are trees therein, or not. And be ye of good courage and bring of the fruit of the land. Now the time [was] the time of the firstripe grapes.
So they went up and spied out the land from the wilderness of Zin unto Rehob, as men come to Hamath.
And they ascended by the Negev and came unto Hebron, where Ahiman, Sheshai, and Talmai, the sons of Anak, [were]. (Now Hebron was built seven years before Zoan in Egypt.)
And they came unto the brook of Eshcol, and from there they cut down a branch with one cluster of grapes, and they bore it between two upon a staff; and [they brought] of the pomegranates and of the figs.
The place was called the brook Eshcol because of the cluster of grapes which the sons of Israel cut down from there.
And they returned from searching of the land after forty days.
And they went and came to Moses and to Aaron and to all the congregation of the sons of Israel, unto the wilderness of Paran to Kadesh and brought back word unto them and unto all the congregation and showed them the fruit of the land.
And they told him and said, We came unto the land where thou didst send us, and surely it flows with milk and honey; and this is the fruit of it.
Nevertheless the people [are] strong that dwell in that land, and the cities [are] very great and strong; and moreover we saw the sons of Anak there.
Amalek dwells in the land of the Negev, and the Hittite and the Jebusite and the Amorite dwell in the mountains, and the Canaanite dwells by the sea and by the side of the Jordan.
Then Caleb stilled the people before Moses, and said, Let us go up at once and possess it; for we are well able to overcome it.
But the men that went up with him said, We are not able to go up against that people, for they [are] stronger than we.
And they brought up an evil report of the land which they had spied out unto the sons of Israel, saying, The land, through which we have gone through to spy it out, [is] a land that eats up its inhabitants; and all the people that we saw in it [are] men of a great stature.
And there we saw giants, the sons of Anak, [of the race] of the giants; and we were in our own sight as locusts, and so we were in their sight.:

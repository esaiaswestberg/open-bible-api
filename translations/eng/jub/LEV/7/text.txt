Likewise this [shall be] the law [of the expiation] of guilt; it [shall be] most holy.
In the place where they kill the burnt offering shall they kill the [expiation of] guilt, and he shall sprinkle its blood round about upon the altar.
And he shall offer of it all the fat thereof, the tail and the fat that covers the intestines
and the two kidneys and the fat that is on them and that which is on the flanks and with the kidneys he shall take away the caul [that is] above the liver.
And the priest shall incense them upon the altar [for] an offering on fire unto the LORD; [and this] shall be [the expiation] of guilt.
Every male among the priests shall eat thereof; it shall be eaten in the holy place for it [is] most holy.
As with the sin, so [shall it be] with the guilt; they shall have the same law; the priest that has made the reconciliation shall have that [which was offered.]
And the priest that offers anyone's burnt offering, [even] the priest shall have for himself the skin of the burnt offering which he has offered.
Likewise every present that is baked in the oven and all that is dressed in the fryingpan or in the pot shall be the priest's that offers it.
And every present mingled with oil and dry shall all the sons of Aaron have, one [as much] as another.
And this [shall be] the law of the sacrifice of peace, which shall be offered unto the LORD.
If it is offered in thanksgiving, then he shall offer for the sacrifice of thanksgiving unleavened cakes mingled with oil and unleavened wafers anointed with oil and cakes mingled with oil, of fine flour, fried.
With cakes of leavened bread he shall offer his offering in the sacrifice of thanksgiving of his peace.
And out of the whole offering he shall offer part to be elevated in offering unto the LORD, [and] it shall be the priest's that sprinkles the blood of the peace.
And the flesh of his sacrifice of peace for thanksgiving shall be eaten the same day that it is offered; he shall not leave any of it until the morning.
But if the sacrifice of his offering [is] a vow, or voluntary, it shall be eaten the same day that he offers his sacrifice; and that which is left of it shall be eaten the next day;
but that which is left of the flesh of the sacrifice on the third day shall be burnt with fire.
And if [any] of the flesh of his sacrifice of peace is eaten at all on the third day, he that offers it shall not be accepted, neither shall it be imputed unto him; it shall be an abomination, and the person that eats of it shall bear his iniquity.
And the flesh that touches any unclean [thing] shall not be eaten; it shall be burnt with fire; but every clean person shall eat of this flesh.
And the person that eats [of] the flesh of the sacrifice of peace, which is of the LORD, being unclean, that person shall be cut off from his people.
Moreover the person that shall touch any unclean [thing,]as the uncleanness of man or [any] unclean beast or any abominable unclean [thing] and eat of the flesh of the sacrifice of peace, which is of the LORD, that person shall be cut off from his people.
And the LORD spoke unto Moses, saying,
Speak unto the sons of Israel, saying, Ye shall eat no manner of fat, of ox or of sheep or of goat.
And the fat of the beast that died of itself and the fat of that [which is] torn [by beasts] may be used in any other use, but ye shall not eat of it.
For whosoever eats fat of an animal, of which an offering is made on fire unto the LORD, the person that eats [it] shall be cut off from his people.
Moreover ye shall eat no manner of blood, [whether it is] of fowl or of beast, in any of your dwellings.
Whatever person [it is] that eats any manner of blood, that person shall be cut off from his people.
And the LORD spoke unto Moses, saying,
Speak unto the sons of Israel, saying, He that offers his sacrifice of peace unto the LORD shall bring his offering of the sacrifice of his peace unto the LORD;
his own hands shall bring the offerings [which must be burned] unto the LORD; he shall bring the fat with the breast that the breast may be waved [for] a wave offering before the LORD.
And the priest shall incense the fat upon the altar; but the breast shall be Aaron's and his sons'.
And ye shall give unto the priest to be elevated in offering the right shoulder of the sacrifices of your peace.
He among the sons of Aaron that offers the blood of the peace and the fat shall have the right shoulder for [his] part;
for I have taken from the sons of Israel of their sacrifices of peace the breast that is waved and the shoulder that is set apart and have given them unto Aaron, the priest, and unto his sons by a perpetual statute among the sons of Israel.
This [is] the anointing of Aaron and the anointing of his sons of the offerings on fire unto the LORD from the day [when] he brought them in to be priests of the LORD,
which [portions] the LORD commanded to be given to them from the day that he anointed them from among the sons of Israel [by] a perpetual statute throughout their generations.
This is the law of the burnt offering, of the present, of sin, of guilt, of the consecrations, and of the sacrifice of peace,
which the LORD commanded Moses in mount Sinai in the day that he commanded the sons of Israel to offer their offerings unto the LORD in the wilderness of Sinai.:

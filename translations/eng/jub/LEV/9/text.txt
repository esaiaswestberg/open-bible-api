And it came to pass on the eighth day [that] Moses called Aaron and his sons and the elders of Israel,
and he said unto Aaron, Take thee a young calf as the sin and a ram as a burnt offering, without blemish, and offer [them] before the LORD.
And unto the sons of Israel thou shalt speak, saying, Take ye a he goat as the sin and a calf and a lamb, [both] of the first year, without blemish, for a burnt offering;
likewise a bullock and a ram for a [sacrifice of] peace, to kill before the LORD; and a present mingled with oil; for today the LORD will appear unto you.
And they brought [that] which Moses commanded before the tabernacle of the testimony, and all the congregation drew near and stood before the LORD.
Then Moses said, This [is] the thing which the LORD commanded that ye should do, and the glory of the LORD shall appear unto you.
And Moses said unto Aaron, Go unto the altar, and offer thy sin, and thy burnt offering, and make reconciliation for thyself and for the people; and offer the offering of the people and make reconciliation for them, as the LORD commanded.
Then Aaron went unto the altar and slew the calf of his own sin.
And the sons of Aaron brought the blood unto him, and he dipped his finger in the blood and put [it] upon the horns of the altar and poured out the [remaining] blood at the bottom of the altar;
and the fat and the kidneys and the caul above the liver of the sin, he incensed upon the altar, as the LORD had commanded Moses.
And the flesh and the hide he burnt with fire outside the camp.
Likewise he slew the burnt offering; and Aaron's sons presented unto him the blood, which he sprinkled round about upon the altar.
After that they presented the burnt offering unto him, by its pieces, and the head; and he incensed [them] upon the altar.
Then he washed the intestines and the legs and burnt [them] with the burnt offering on the altar.
He also offered the people's offering and took the he goat, which [was] the sin of the people, and slew it and offered it for [their] sin, as the first.
And he brought the burnt offering and offered it according to the ordinance.
Likewise he offered the present and took a handful thereof and incensed [it] upon the altar, beside the burnt sacrifice of the morning.
He also slew the bullock and the ram in sacrifice of peace, which [was] for the people; and Aaron's sons presented unto him the blood (which he sprinkled upon the altar round about)
and the fat of the bullock and of the ram, the tail and that which covers [the inwards] and the kidneys and the caul [above] the liver;
and they put the fat upon the breasts, and he burnt the fat upon the altar.
But the breasts, with the right shoulder, Aaron waved, waving them before the LORD, as the LORD had commanded Moses.
After that, Aaron lifted up his hands toward the people and blessed them and came down from offering the sin and the burnt offering and the peace.
And Moses and Aaron went into the tabernacle of the testimony and came out and blessed the people; and the glory of the LORD appeared unto all the people.
And there came a fire out from before the LORD and consumed upon the altar the burnt offering and the fat, [which] when all the people saw, they praised and fell on their faces.:

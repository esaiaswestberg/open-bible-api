And thou shalt say in that day, O Lord, I will prayse thee: though thou wast angrie with me, thy wrath is turned away, and thou comfortest me.
Beholde, God is my saluation: I will trust, and will not feare: for ye Lord God is my strength and song: he also is become my saluation.
Therefore with ioy shall ye drawe waters out of the welles of saluation.
And ye shall say in that day, Prayse the Lord: call vpon his Name: declare his workes among the people: make mention of them, for his Name is exalted.
Sing vnto the Lord, for he hath done excellent things: this is knowen in all the worlde.
Cry out, and shoute, O inhabitant of Zion: for great is ye holy one of Israel in the middes of thee.

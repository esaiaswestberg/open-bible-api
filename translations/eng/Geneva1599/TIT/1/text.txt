Paul a seruaunt of God, and an Apostle of Iesus Christ, according to the faith of Gods elect, and the acknowledging of the trueth, which is according vnto godlines,
Vnto the hope of eternall life, which God that cannot lie, hath promised before the world began:
But hath made his worde manifest in due time through the preaching, which is committed vnto me, according to the commandement of God our Sauiour:
To Titus my naturall sonne according to the common faith, Grace, mercie and peace from God the Father, and from the Lord Iesus Christ our Sauiour.

One of themselues, euen one of their owne prophets said, The Cretians are alwaies liars, euill beastes, slowe bellies.
This witnesse is true: wherefore conuince them sharply, that they may be sound in ye faith,
And not taking heede to Iewish fables and commandements of men, that turne away from the trueth.
Vnto the pure are all things pure, but vnto them that are defiled, and vnbeleeuing, is nothing pure, but euen their mindes and consciences are defiled.
They professe that they know God, but by works they deny him, and are abominable and disobedient, and vnto euery good worke reprobate.

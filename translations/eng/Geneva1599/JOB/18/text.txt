Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said,
When will yee make an ende of your words? cause vs to vnderstande, and then wee will speake.
Wherefore are wee counted as beastes, and are vile in your sight?
Thou art as one that teareth his soule in his anger. Shall the earth bee forsaken for thy sake? or the rocke remoued out of his place?
Yea, the light of the wicked shalbe quenched, and the sparke of his fire shall not shine.
The light shalbe darke in his dwelling, and his candle shalbe put out with him.
The steps of his strength shalbe restrained, and his owne counsell shall cast him downe.
For hee is taken in the net by his feete, and he walketh vpon the snares.
The grenne shall take him by the heele, and the theefe shall come vpon him.
A snare is layed for him in the ground, and a trappe for him in the way.
Fearefulnesse shall make him afrayde on euery side, and shall driue him to his feete.
His strength shalbe famine: and destruction shalbe readie at his side.
It shall deuoure the inner partes of his skinne, and the first borne of death shall deuoure his strength.
His hope shalbe rooted out of his dwelling, and shall cause him to go to the King of feare.
Feare shall dwell in his house (because it is not his) and brimstone shalbe scattered vpon his habitation.
His rootes shalbe dryed vp beneath, and aboue shall his branche be cut downe.
His remembrance shall perish from the earth, and he shall haue no name in the streete.
They shall driue him out of the light vnto darkenesse, and chase him out of the world.
Hee shall neither haue sonne nor nephewe among his people, nor any posteritie in his dwellings.
The posteritie shalbe astonied at his day, and feare shall come vpon the ancient.
Surely such are the habitations of the wicked, and this is the place of him that knoweth not God.

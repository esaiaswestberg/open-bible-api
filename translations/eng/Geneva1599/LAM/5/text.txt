Remember, O Lord, what is come vpon vs: consider, and behold our reproche.
Our inheritance is turned to the strangers, our houses to the aliants.
We are fatherles, euen without father, and our mothers are as widowes.
Wee haue drunke our water for money, and our wood is solde vnto vs.
Our neckes are vnder persecution: we are wearie, and haue no rest.
We haue giuen our handes to the Egyptians, and to Asshur, to be satisfied with bread.
Our fathers haue sinned, and are not, and we haue borne their iniquities.
Seruants haue ruled ouer vs, none would deliuer vs out of their hands.
Wee gate our bread with the perill of our liues, because of the sword of the wildernesse.
Our skinne was blacke like as an ouen because of the terrible famine.
They defiled the women in Zion, and the maydes in the cities of Iudah.
The princes are hanged vp by their hande: the faces of the elders were not had in honour.
They tooke the yong men to grinde, and the children fell vnder the wood.
The Elders haue ceased from the gate and the yong men from their songs.
The ioy of our heart is gone, our daunce is turned into mourning.
The crowne of our head is fallen: wo nowe vnto vs, that we haue sinned.
Therefore our heart is heauy for these things, our eyes are dimme,
Because of the mountaine of Zion which is desolate: the foxes runne vpon it.
But thou, O Lord, remainest for euer: thy throne is from generation to generation.
Wherefore doest thou forget vs for euer, and forsake vs so long time?
Turne thou vs vnto thee, O Lord, and we shalbe turned: renue our dayes as of olde.
But thou hast vtterly reiected vs: thou art exceedingly angry against vs.

A Psalme of David. The Lord said vnto my Lord, Sit thou at my right hand, vntill I make thine enemies thy footestoole.
The Lord shall send the rod of thy power out of Zion: be thou ruler in the middes of thine enemies.
Thy people shall come willingly at the time of assembling thine armie in holy beautie: the youth of thy wombe shalbe as the morning dewe.
The Lord sware and wil not repent, Thou art a Priest for euer after ye order of Melchi-zedek.
The Lord, that is at thy right hand, shall wound Kings in the day of his wrath.
He shalbe iudge among the heathen: he shall fill all with dead bodies, and smite the head ouer great countreis.
He shall drinke of the brooke in the way: therefore shall he lift vp his head.

I love the Lord, because he hath heard my voyce and my prayers.
For he hath inclined his eare vnto me, whe I did call vpon him in my dayes.
When the snares of death copassed me, and the griefes of the graue caught me: when I founde trouble and sorowe.
Then I called vpon the Name of the Lord, saying, I beseech thee, O Lord, deliuer my soule.
The Lord is mercifull and righteous, and our God is full of compassion.
The Lord preserueth the simple: I was in miserie and he saued me.
Returne vnto thy rest, O my soule: for the Lord hath bene beneficiall vnto thee,
Because thou hast deliuered my soule from death, mine eyes from teares, and my feete from falling.
I shall walke before the Lord in the lande of the liuing.
I beleeued, therefore did I speake: for I was sore troubled.
I said in my feare, All men are lyers.
What shall I render vnto the Lord for all his benefites toward me?
I will take the cup of saluation, and call vpon the Name of the Lord.
I will pay my vowes vnto the Lord, euen nowe in the presence of all his people.
Precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of his Saintes.
Beholde, Lord: for I am thy seruant, I am thy seruant, and the sonne of thine handmaide: thou hast broken my bondes.
I will offer to thee a sacrifice of prayse, and will call vpon the Name of the Lord.
I will pay my vowes vnto the Lord, euen nowe in the presence of all his people,
In the courtes of ye Lords house, euen in the middes of thee, O Ierusalem. Praise ye the Lord.

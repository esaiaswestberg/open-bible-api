To him that excelleth. A Psalme of David, when the Prophet Nathan came unto him, after he had gone in to Bath-sheba. Have mercie vpon me, O God, according to thy louing kindnes: according to the multitude of thy compassions put away mine iniquities.
Wash me throughly from mine iniquitie, and clense me from my sinne.
For I know mine iniquities, and my sinne is euer before me.
Against thee, against thee onely haue I sinned, and done euill in thy sight, that thou mayest be iust when thou speakest, and pure when thou iudgest.
Beholde, I was borne in iniquitie, and in sinne hath my mother conceiued me.
Beholde, thou louest trueth in the inwarde affections: therefore hast thou taught mee wisedome in the secret of mine heart.
Purge me with hyssope, and I shalbe cleane: wash me, and I shalbe whiter then snowe.
Make me to heare ioye and gladnes, that the bones, which thou hast broken, may reioyce.
Hide thy face from my sinnes, and put away all mine iniquities.
Create in mee a cleane heart, O God, and renue a right spirit within me.
Cast mee not away from thy presence, and take not thine holy Spirit from me.
Restore to me the ioy of thy saluation, and stablish me with thy free Spirit.
Then shall I teache thy wayes vnto the wicked, and sinners shalbe conuerted vnto thee.
Deliuer me from blood, O God, which art the God of my saluation, and my tongue shall sing ioyfully of thy righteousnes.
Open thou my lippes, O Lord, and my mouth shall shewe foorth thy praise.
For thou desirest no sacrifice, though I would giue it: thou delitest not in burnt offering.
The sacrifices of God are a contrite spirit: a contrite and a broken heart, O God, thou wilt not despise.
Bee fauourable vnto Zion for thy good pleasure: builde the walles of Ierusalem.
Then shalt thou accept ye sacrifices of righteousnes, euen the burnt offering and oblation: then shall they offer calues vpon thine altar.

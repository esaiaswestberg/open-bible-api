Shigaion of Dauid, which he sang unto the Lord, concerning the wordes of Chush the sonne of Iemini. O Lord my God, in thee I put my trust: saue me from all that persecute me, and deliuer me,
Least he deuoure my soule like a lion, and teare it in pieces, while there is none to helpe.
O Lord my God, if I haue done this thing, if there be any wickednes in mine handes,
If I haue rewarded euill vnto him that had peace with mee, (yea I haue deliuered him that vexed me without cause)
Then let the enemie persecute my soule and take it: yea, let him treade my life downe vpon the earth, and lay mine honour in the dust. Selah.
Arise, O Lord, in thy wrath, and lift vp thy selfe against the rage of mine enemies, and awake for mee according to the iudgement that thou hast appointed.
So shall the Congregation of the people compasse thee about: for their sakes therefore returne on hie.
The Lord shall iudge the people: Iudge thou me, O Lord, according to my righteousnesse, and according to mine innocencie, that is in mee.
Oh let the malice of the wicked come to an ende: but guide thou the iust: for the righteous God trieth the hearts and reines.
My defence is in God, who preserueth the vpright in heart.
God iudgeth the righteous, and him that contemneth God euery day.
Except he turne, he hath whet his sword: he hath bent his bowe and made it readie.
Hee hath also prepared him deadly weapons: hee will ordeine his arrowes for them that persecute me.
Beholde, hee shall trauaile with wickednes: for he hath conceiued mischiefe, but he shall bring foorth a lye.
Hee hath made a pitte and digged it, and is fallen into the pit that he made.
His mischiefe shall returne vpon his owne head, and his crueltie shall fall vpon his owne pate.
I wil praise the Lord according to his righteousnes, and will sing praise to the Name of the Lord most high.

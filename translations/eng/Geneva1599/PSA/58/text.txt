To him that excelleth. Destroy not. A Psalme of David on Michtam. Is it true? O Congregation, speake ye iustly? O sonnes of men, iudge ye vprightly?
Yea, rather ye imagine mischiefe in your heart: your hands execute crueltie vpon the earth.
The wicked are strangers from ye wombe: euen from the belly haue they erred, and speake lyes.
Their poyson is euen like the poyson of a serpent: like ye deafe adder that stoppeth his eare.
Which heareth not the voyce of the inchanter, though he be most expert in charming.
Breake their teeth, O God, in their mouthes: breake the iawes of the yong lions, O Lord.
Let them melt like the waters, let them passe away: when hee shooteth his arrowes, let them be as broken.
Let them consume like a snayle that melteth, and like the vntimely fruite of a woman, that hath not seene the sunne.
As raw flesh before your pots feele the fire of thornes: so let him cary them away as with a whirlewinde in his wrath.
The righteous shall reioyce when he seeeth the vengeance: he shall wash his feete in the blood of the wicked.
And men shall say, Verily there is fruite for the righteous: doutlesse there is a God that iudgeth in the earth.

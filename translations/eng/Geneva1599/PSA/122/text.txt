A song of degrees, or Psalme of David. I rejoiced, when they sayd to me, We wil go into the house of the Lord.
Our feete shall stand in thy gates, O Ierusalem.
Ierusalem is builded as a citie, that is compact together in it selfe:
Whereunto the Tribes, euen the Tribes of the Lord go vp according to the testimonie to Israel, to prayse the Name of the Lord.
For there are thrones set for iudgement, euen the thrones of the house of Dauid.
Pray for the peace of Ierusalem: let them prosper that loue thee.
Peace be within thy walles, and prosperitie within thy palaces.
For my brethren and neighbours sakes I will wish thee now prosperitie.
Because of the House of the Lord our God, I will procure thy wealth.

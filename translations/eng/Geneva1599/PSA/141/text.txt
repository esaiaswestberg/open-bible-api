A Psalme of David. O Lord, I call vpon thee: haste thee vnto me: heare my voyce, when I cry vnto thee.
Let my prayer be directed in thy sight as incense, and the lifting vp of mine hands as an euening sacrifice.
Set a watch, O Lord, before my mouth, and keepe the doore of my lips.
Incline not mine heart to euill, that I should commit wicked workes with men that worke iniquitie: and let me not eate of their delicates.
Let the righteous smite me: for that is a benefite: and let him reprooue me, and it shalbe a precious oyle, that shall not breake mine head: for within a while I shall euen pray in their miseries.
When their iudges shall be cast downe in stonie places, they shall heare my wordes, for they are sweete.
Our bones lye scattered at the graues mouth, as he that heweth wood or diggeth in the earth.
But mine eyes looke vnto thee, O Lord God: in thee is my trust: leaue not my soule destitute.
Keepe me from the snare, which they haue layde for me, and from the grennes of the workers of iniquitie.
Let the wicked fall into his nettes together, whiles I escape.

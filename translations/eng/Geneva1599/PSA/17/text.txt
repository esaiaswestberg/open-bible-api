The prayer of Dauid. Heare the right, O Lord, consider my crye: hearken vnto my prayer of lips vnfained.
Let my sentence come forth from thy presence, and let thine eyes beholde equitie.
Thou hast prooued and visited mine heart in the night: thou hast tryed me, and foundest nothing: for I was purposed that my mouth should not offend.
Concerning the workes of men, by the wordes of thy lips I kept mee from the paths of the cruell man.
Stay my steps in thy paths, that my feete doe not slide.
I haue called vpon thee: surely thou wilt heare me, O God: incline thine eare to me, and hearken vnto my wordes.
Shewe thy marueilous mercies, thou that art the Sauiour of them that trust in thee, from such as resist thy right hand.
Keepe me as the apple of the eye: hide me vnder the shadowe of thy wings,
From the wicked that oppresse mee, from mine enemies, which compasse me round about for my soule.
They are inclosed in their owne fat, and they haue spoken proudely with their mouth.
They haue compassed vs now in our steps: they haue set their eyes to bring downe to the ground:
Like as a lyon that is greedy of pray, and as it were a lyons whelp lurking in secret places.
Vp Lord, disappoint him: cast him downe: deliuer my soule from the wicked with thy sworde,
From men by thine hand, O Lord, from men of the world, who haue their portion in this life, whose bellies thou fillest with thine hid treasure: their children haue ynough, and leaue the rest of their substance for their children.
But I will beholde thy face in righteousnes, and when I awake, I shalbe satisfied with thine image.

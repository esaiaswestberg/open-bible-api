To him that excelleth. A Psalme of Dauid. Blessed is he that iudgeth wisely of the poore: the Lord shall deliuer him in ye time of trouble.
The Lord will keepe him, and preserue him aliue: he shalbe blessed vpon the earth, and thou wilt not deliuer him vnto the will of his enemies.
The Lord wil strengthen him vpon ye bed of sorow: thou hast turned al his bed in his sicknes.
Therefore I saide, Lord haue mercie vpon me: heale my soule, for I haue sinned against thee.
Mine enemies speake euill of me, saying, When shall he die, and his name perish?
And if hee come to see mee, hee speaketh lies, but his heart heapeth iniquitie within him, and when he commeth foorth, he telleth it.
All they that hate me, whisper together against me: euen against me do they imagine mine hurt.
A mischiefe is light vpon him, and he that lyeth, shall no more rise.
Yea, my familiar friend, whom I trusted, which did eate of my bread, hath lifted vp the heele against me.
Therefore, O Lord, haue mercy vpon mee, and raise me vp: so I shall reward them.
By this I know that thou fauourest me, because mine enemie doth not triumph against me.
And as for me, thou vpholdest me in mine integritie, and doest set me before thy face for euer.
Blessed be the Lord God of Israel worlde without ende. So be it, euen so be it.

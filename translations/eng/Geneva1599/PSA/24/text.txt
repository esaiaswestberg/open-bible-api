A Psalme of David. The earth is the Lordes, and all that therein is: the worlde and they that dwell therein.
For he hath founded it vpon the seas: and established it vpon the floods.
Who shall ascende into the mountaine of the Lord? and who shall stand in his holy place?
Euen he that hath innocent handes, and a pure heart: which hath not lift vp his minde vnto vanitie, nor sworne deceitfully.
He shall receiue a blessing from the Lord, and righteousnesse from the God of his saluation.
This is the generation of them that seeke him, of them that seeke thy face, this is Iaakob. Selah.
Lift vp your heads ye gates, and be ye lift vp ye euerlasting doores, and the King of glory shall come in.
Who is this King of glorie? the Lord, strong and mightie, euen the Lord mightie in battell.
Lift vp your heads, ye gates, and lift vp your selues, ye euerlasting doores, and the King of glorie shall come in.
Who is this King of glory? the Lord of hostes, he is the King of glorie. Selah.

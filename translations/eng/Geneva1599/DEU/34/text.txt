Then Moses went from the plaine of Moab vp into mount Nebo vnto the top of Pisgah that is ouer against Iericho: and the Lord shewed him all the land of Gilead, vnto Dan,
And all Naphtali and the land of Ephraim and Manasseh, and all the land of Iudah, vnto the vtmost sea:
And the South, and the plaine of the valley of Iericho, the citie of palmetrees, vnto Zoar.
And the Lord said vnto him, This is the lande which I sware vnto Abraham, to Izhak and to Iaacob saying, I will giue it vnto thy seede: I haue caused thee to see it with thine eyes, but thou shalt not goe ouer thither.
So Moses the seruant of the Lord dyed there in the land of Moab, according to the worde of the Lord.
And hee buried him in a valley in the land of Moab ouer against Beth-peor, but no man knoweth of his sepulchre vnto this day.
Moses was nowe an hundreth and twentie yeere olde when hee died, his eye was not dimme, nor his naturall force abated.
And the children of Israel wept for Moses in the plaine of Moab thirtie dayes: so the dayes of weeping and mourning for Moses were ended.
And Ioshua the sonne of Nun was full of ye spirit of wisedome: for Moses had put his hands vpon him. And the children of Israel were obedient vnto him, and did as the Lord had commanded Moses.
But there arose not a Prophet since in Israel like vnto Moses (whome the Lord knew face to face)
In all ye miracles and wonders which ye Lord sent him to do in ye land of Egypt before Pharaoh and before all his seruantes, and before al his land,
And in all that mightie hand and all that great feare, which Moses wrought in the sight of all Israel.

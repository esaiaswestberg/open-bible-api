And Petre and Joon wenten vp in to the temple, at the nynthe our of preiyng.
And a man that was lame fro the wombe of his modir, was borun, and was leid ech dai at the yate of the temple, that is seid feir, to axe almes of men that entriden in to the temple.
This, whanne he say Petre and Joon bigynnynge to entre in to the temple, preyede that he schulde take almes.
And Petre with Joon bihelde on hym, and seide, Biholde thou in to vs.
And he biheelde in to hem, and hopide, that he schulde take sumwhat of hem.
But Petre seide, Y haue nether siluer ne gold; but that that Y haue, Y yiue to thee. In the name of Jhesu Crist of Nazareth, rise thou vp, and go.
And he took hym bi the riythoond, and heuede hym vp; and anoon hise leggis and hise feet weren sowdid togidere;
and he lippide, and stood, and wandride. And he entride with hem in to the temple, and wandride, and lippide, and heriede God.
And al the puple sai hym walkinge, and heriynge God.
And thei knewen hym, that he it was that sat at almes at the feire yate of the temple. And thei weren fillid with wondryng, and stoniynge, in that thing that byfelde to hym.
But whanne thei sien Petre and Joon, al the puple ran to hem at the porche that was clepid of Salomon, and wondriden greetli.
And Petre siy, and answeride to the puple, Men of Israel, what wondren ye in this thing? ether what biholden ye vs, as by oure vertue ethir power we maden this man for to walke?
God of Abraham, and God of Ysaac, and God of Jacob, God of oure fadris, hath glorified his sone Jhesu, whom ye bitraieden, and denyeden bifor the face of Pilat, whanne he demede hym to be delyuered.
But ye denyeden the hooli and the riytful, and axiden a mansleer to be youun to you.
And ye slowen the maker of lijf, whom God reiside fro deth, of whom we ben witnessis.
And in the feith of his name he hath confermyd this man, whom ye seen and knowen; the name of hym, and the feith that is bi him, yaf to this man ful heelthe in the siyt of alle you.
And now, britheren, Y woot that bi vnwityng ye diden, as also youre princis.
But God that bifor telde bi the mouth of alle profetis, that his Crist schulde suffre, hath fillid so.
Therfor be ye repentaunt, and be ye conuertid, that youre synnes be don awei,
that whanne the tymes of refresching schulen come from the siyt of the Lord, and he schal sende thilke Jhesu Crist,
that is now prechid to you. Whom it bihoueth heuene to resseyue, in to the tymes of restitucioun of alle thingis, which the Lord spak bi the mouth of hise hooli prophetis fro the world.
For Moises seide, For the Lord youre God schal reise to you a profete, of youre britheren; as me, ye schulen here hym bi alle thingis, what euer he schal speke to you.
And it schal be, that euery man that schal not here the ilke profete, schal be distried fro the puple.
And alle prophetis fro Samuel and aftirward, that spaken, telden these daies.
But ye ben the sones of prophetis, and of the testament, that God ordeynede to oure fadris, and seide to Abraham, In thi seed alle the meynes of erthe schulen be blessid.
God reiside his sone first to you, and sente hym blessynge you, that ech man conuerte hym from his wickidnesse.

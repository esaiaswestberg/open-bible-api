But as it was demed hym to schippe into Ytalie, thei bitoken Poul with othere kepers to a centurien, bi name Julius, of the cumpeny of knyytis of the emperoure.
And we wenten vp in to the schip of Adrymetis, and bigunnen to seile, and weren borun aboute the placis of Asie, while Aristark of Macedonye, Tessalonycence, dwellide stille with vs.
And in the dai suynge, we camen to Sydon; and Julius tretyde curteisli Poul, and suffride to go to frendis, and do his nedis.
And whanne we remouede fro thennus, we vndurseiliden to Cipre, for that wyndis weren contrarie.
And we seiliden in the see of Silicie and Pamfilie, and camen to Listris, that is Licie.
And there the centurien foond a schip of Alisaundre, seilinge in to Ytalie, and puttide vs ouer in to it.
And whanne in many daies we seilden slowli, and vnnethe camen ayens Guydum, for the winde lettide vs, we seiliden to Crete, bisidis Salomona.
And vnnethe we seilden bisidis, and camen into a place, that is clepid of good hauen, to whom the cite Tessala was niy.
And whanne miche time was passid, and whanne seiling thanne was not sikir, for that fasting was passid, Poul coumfortide hem,
and seide to hem, Men, Y se that seiling bigynneth to be with wrong and myche harm, not oonli of charge and of the schip, but also of oure lyues.
But the centurien bileuede more to the gouernour, and to the lord of the schip, thanne to these thingis that weren seid of Poul.
And whanne the hauene was not able to dwelle in wynter, ful many ordeyneden counsel to seile fro thennus, if on ony maner thei miyten come to Fenyce, to dwelle in wynter at the hauene of Crete, which biholdith to Affrik, and to Corum.
And whanne the south blew, thei gessiden hem to holde purpos; and whanne thei hadden removed fro Asson, thei seiliden to Crete.
And not aftir miche, the wynde Tifonyk, that is clepid north eest, was ayens it.
And whanne the schip was rauyschid, and myyte not enforse ayens the wynde, whanne the schip was youun to the blowynges of the wynde, we weren borun with cours into an ile,
that is clepid Canda; and vnethe we miyten gete a litil boot.
And whanne this was takun vp, thei vsiden helpis, girdinge togidere the schippe; and dredden, lest thei schulden falle into sondi placis. And whanne the vessel was vndur set, so thei weren borun.
And for we weren throwun with strong tempest, in the dai suynge thei maden casting out.
And the thridde dai with her hoondis thei castiden awei the instrumentis of the schip.
And whanne the sunne nether the sterris weren seie bi many daies, and tempest not a litil neiyede, now al the hope of oure helthe was don awei.
And whanne myche fasting hadde be, thanne Poul stood in the myddil of hem, and seide, A! men, it bihofte, whanne ye herden me, not to haue take awei the schip fro Crete, and gete this wronge and casting out.
And now Y counsel you to be of good coumfort, for los of no persoone of you schal be, outakun of the schip.
For an aungel of God, whos Y am, and to whom Y serue, stood niy to me in this niyt, and seide, Poul, drede thou not;
it bihoueth thee to stonde bifore the emperour. And lo! God hath youun to thee alle that ben in the schip with thee.
For which thing, ye men, be ye of good coumfort; for Y bileue to my God, that so it schal be, as it is seid to me.
And it bihoueth vs to come into sum yle.
But aftirward that in the fourtenthe dai the niyt cam on vs seilinge in the stony see, aboute mydniyt the schipmen supposiden sum cuntre to appere to hem.
And thei kesten doun a plommet, and founden twenti pasis of depnesse. And aftir a litil thei weren departid fro thennus, and foundun fiftene pasis.
And thei dredden, lest we schulden haue fallun in to scharp placis; and fro the last parti of the schip thei senten foure ankeris, and desiriden that the dai hadde be come.
And whanne the schipmen souyten to fle fro the schip, whanne thei hadden sent a litil boot in to the see, vndur colour as thei schulden bigynne to stretche forth the ankeris fro the formere part of the schip,
Poul seide to the centurien and to the knyytis, But these dwellen in the schip, ye moun not be maad saaf.
Thanne knyytis kittiden awei the cordis of the litil boot, and suffriden it to falle awei.
And whanne the dai was come, Poul preiede alle men to take mete, and seide, The fourtenthe dai this dai ye `abiden, and dwellen fastinge, and taken no thing.
Wherfor Y preie you to take mete, for youre helthe; for of noon of you the heer of the heed schal perische.
And whanne he hadde seid these thingis, Poul took breed, and dide thankyngis to God in the siyt of alle men; and whanne he hadde brokun, he bigan to eete.
And alle weren maad of betere coumfort, and thei token mete.
And we weren alle men in the schip, two hundrid seuenti and sexe.
And thei weren fillid with mete, and dischargiden the schip, and castiden whete in to the see.
And whanne the dai was comun, thei knewen no lond; and thei bihelden an hauene that hadde a watir bank, in to which thei thouyten, if thei miyten, to bringe vp the schip.
And whanne thei hadden take vp the ankeris, thei bitoken hem to the see, and slakiden togidir the ioyntours of gouernails. And with a litil seil lift vp, bi blowyng of the wynde thei wenten to the bank.
And whanne we felden into a place of grauel gon al aboute with the see, thei hurtliden the schip. And whanne the formere part was fitchid, it dwellide vnmouable, and the last part was brokun of strengthe of the see.
And counsel of the kniytis was, to sle men that weren in warde, lest ony schulde ascape, whanne he hadde swymmed out.
But the centurien wolde kepe Poul, and forbede it to be don. And he comaundide hem that miyte swymme, to go in to the see, and scape, and go out to the loond.
And thei baren summe othere on boordis, summe on tho thingis that weren of the schip. And so it was don, that alle men ascapiden to the lond.

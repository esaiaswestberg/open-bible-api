And God blisside Noe and hise sones, and seide to hem, Encreesse ye, and be ye multiplied, and fille ye the erthe;
and youre drede and tremblyng be on alle vnresonable beestis of erthe, and on alle briddis of heuene, with alle thingis that ben moued in erthe; alle fischis of the see ben youun to youre hond.
And al thing which is moued and lyueth schal be to you in to mete; Y have youe to you alle thingis as greene wortis,
outakun that ye schulen not ete fleisch with blood,
for Y schal seke the blood of youre lyues of the hoond of alle vnresonable beestis and of the hoond of man, of the hoond of man and of hys brother Y schal seke the lijf of man.
Who euere schedith out mannus blood, his blood schal be sched; for man is maad to the ymage of God.
Forsothe encreesse ye, and be ye multiplied, and entre ye on erthe, and fille ye it, Also the Lord seide thes thingis to Noe,
and to his sones with him, Lo!
Y schal make my couenaunt with you, and with your seed after you,
and to ech lyuynge soule which is with you, as wel in briddis as in werk beestis and smale beestis of erthe, and to alle thingis that yeden out of the schip, and to alle vnresonable beestis of erthe.
Y schal make my couenaunt with you, and ech fleisch schal no more be slayn of the watris of the greet flood, nethir the greet flood distriynge al erthe schal be more.
And God seide, This is the signe of boond of pees, which Y yyue bitwixe me and you, and to ech lyuynge soule which is with you, in to euerlastynge generaciouns.
Y schal sette my bowe in the cloudis, and it schal be a signe of boond of pees bitwixe me and erthe;
and whanne Y schal hile heuene with cloudis, my bowe schal appere in the cloudis,
and Y schal haue mynde of my boond of pees which Y made with you, and with ech soule lyuynge, that nurschith fleisch; and the watris of the greet flood schulen no more be to do awey al fleish.
And my bowe schal be in the cloudis, and Y schal se it, and Y schal haue mynde of euerlastynge boond of pees, which is maad bitwixe God and man, and ech soul lyuynge of al fleisch which is on erthe.
And God seide to Noe, This schal be a signe of boond of pees, which Y made bitwixe me and ech fleisch on erthe.
Therfore thei that yeden out of the schip weren Noe, Sem, Cham, and Japheth; forsothe Cham, thilke is the fadir of Chanaan.
These thre weren the sones of Noe, and al the kynde of men was sowun of hem on al erthe.
And Noe, an erthe tiliere, bigan to tile the erthe, and he plauntide a viner,
and he drank wyn, and was drunkun; and he was nakid, and lay in his tabernacle.
And whanne Cham, the fadir of Chanaan, hadde seien this thing, that is, that the schameful membris of his fadir weren maad nakid, he telde to hise tweye britheren with out forth.
And sotheli Sem and Jafeth puttiden a mentil on her schuldris, and thei yeden bacward, and hileden the schameful membris of her fadir, and her faces weren turned awei, and thei sien not the priuy membris of her fadir.
And forsothe Noe wakide of the wyn, and whanne he hadde lerned what thingis his lesse sone hadde do to hym,
he seide, Cursid be the child Canaan, he schal be seruaunt of seruauntis to hise britheren.
And Noe seide, Blessid be the Lord God of Sem,
and Chanaan be the seruaunt to Sem; God alarge Jafeth, and dwelle in the tabernaclis of Sem, and Chanaan be seruaunt of hym.
Forsothe Noe lyuede aftir the greet flood thre hundrid and fifti yeer;
and alle the daies of hym weren fillid nyn hundrid and fifty yeer, and he was deed.

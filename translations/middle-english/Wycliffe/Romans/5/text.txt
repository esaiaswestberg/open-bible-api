Therfor we, iustified of feith, haue we pees at God bi oure Lord Jhesu Crist.
Bi whom we han niy goyng to, bi feith in to this grace, in which we stonden, and han glorie in the hope of the glorie of Goddis children.
And not this oneli, but also we glorien in tribulaciouns, witynge that tribulacioun worchith pacience,
and pacience preuyng, and preuyng hope.
And hope confoundith not, for the charite of God is spred abrood in oure hertis bi the Hooli Goost, that is youun to vs.
And while that we weren sijk aftir the tyme, what diede Crist for wickid men?
For vnnethis dieth ony man for the iust man; and yit for a good man perauenture summan dar die.
But God comendith his charite in vs; for if whanne we weren yit synneris,
aftir the tyme Crist was deed for vs, thanne myche more now we iustified in his blood, schulen be saaf fro wraththe bi him.
For if whanne we weren enemyes, we ben recounselid to God bi the deth of his sone, myche more we recounselid schulen be saaf in the lijf of hym.
And not oneli this, but also we glorien in God, bi oure Lord Jhesu Crist, bi whom we han resseyued now recounseling.
Therfor as bi o man synne entride in to this world, and bi synne deth, and so deth passide forth in to alle men, in which man alle men synneden.
For `til to the lawe synne was in the world; but synne was not rettid, whanne lawe was not.
But deth regnyde from Adam `til to Moises, also in to hem that synneden not in licnesse of the trespassyng of Adam, the which is licnesse of Crist to comynge.
But not as gilt, so the yifte; for if thorouy the gilt of oon manye ben deed, myche more the grace of God and the yifte in the grace of o man Jhesu Crist hath aboundid in to many men.
And not as bi o synne, so bi the yifte; for the doom of oon in to condempnacioun, but grace of many giltis in to iustificacioun.
For if in the gilt of oon deth regnede thorouy oon, myche more men that takyn plente of grace, and of yyuyng, and of riytwisnesse, schulen regne in lijf bi oon Jhesu Crist.
Therfor as bi the gilt of oon in to alle men in to condempnacioun, so bi the riytwisnesse of oon in to alle men in to iustifiyng of lijf.
For as bi inobedience of o man manye ben maad synneris, so bi the obedience of oon manye schulen be iust.
And the lawe entride, that gilt schulde be plenteuouse; but where gilt was plenteuouse,
grace was more plenteuouse. That as synne regnede in to deth, so grace regne bi riytwisnesse in to euerlastynge lijf, bi `Crist Jhesu oure Lord.

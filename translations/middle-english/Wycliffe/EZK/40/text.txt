In the fyue and twentithe yeer of oure passyng ouer, in the bigynnyng of the yeer, in the tenthe dai of the monethe, in the fourtenthe yeer after that the citee was smytun, in this same dai the hond of the Lord was maad on me, and he brouyte me thidur in the reuelaciouns of God.
And he brouyte me in to the lond of Israel, and he leet me doun on a ful hiy hil, on which was as the bildyng of a citee goynge to the south;
and he ledde me in thidur. And lo! a man, whos licnesse was as the licnesse of bras, and a coorde of flex was in his hond, and a reed of mesure in his hond; forsothe he stood in the yate.
And the same man spak to me, Thou sone of man, se with thin iyen, and here with thin eeris, and sette thin herte on alle thingis, whiche Y schal schewe to thee, for thou art brouyt hidur, that tho be schewid to thee; telle thou alle thingis whiche thou seest to the hous of Israel.
And lo! a wal withouteforth, in the cumpas of the hous on ech side; and in the hond of the man was a rehed of mesure of sixe cubitis and a spanne, that is, an handibreede; and he mat the breede of the bildyng with o rehed, and the hiynesse bi o rehed.
And he cam to the yate that bihelde the weie of the eest, and he stiede bi degrees of it; and he mat the lyntil of the yate bi o rehed the breede, that is, o lyntil bi o rehed in breede;
and he mat o chaumbre bi o rehed in lengthe, and bi o rehed in breed, and fyue cubitis bitwixe chaumbris;

And he mat the breede of the lyntel of the yate of ten cubitis, and the lengthe of the yate of threttene cubitis.
And he mat a margyn of a cubit bifor the chaumbris, and o cubit was the ende on ech side; forsothe the chaumbris weren of sixe cubitis on this side and on that side.
And he mat the yate fro the roof of the chaumbre til to the roof therof, the breede of fyue and twenti cubitis, a dore ayens a dore.

And he mat wyndows naraw with out and large with ynne, in the chaumbris and frountis of tho, that weren with ynne the yate on ech side bi cumpas. Sotheli in lijk maner also wyndows weren in the porchis bi cumpas with ynne; and the peynture of palm trees was grauun bifor the frountis.
And he ledde me out to the outermere halle, and lo! tresories, and pawment arayed with stoon in the halle bi cumpas; thretti tresories in the cumpas of the pawment;

And he mat the breede fro the face of the lowere yate til to the frount of the ynnere halle with outforth, an hundrid cubitis at the eest, and at the north.
And he mat bothe in lengthe and in breede the yate that bihelde the weie of the north, of the outermore halle.

Sotheli the wyndows therof, and the porche, and the grauyngis, weren bi the mesure of the yate that bihelde to the eest; and the stiyng therof was of seuene degrees, and a porche was bifore it.
And the yate of the ynnere halle was ayens the yate of the north, and ayens the eest yate; and he mat fro the yate til to the yate an hundrid cubitis.

And he ledde me in to the ynnere halle, to the south yate; and he mat the yate bi the formere mesuris;

And he seide to me, This treserie, that biholdith the south weie, is of the prestis that waken in the kepyngis of the temple,
Sotheli the tresorye that biholdith to the weie of the north, schal be of the preestis that waken to the seruice of the auter; these ben the sones of Sadoch, whiche of the sones of Leuy neiyen to the Lord, for to mynystre to hym.

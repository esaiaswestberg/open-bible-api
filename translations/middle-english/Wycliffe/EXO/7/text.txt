And the Lord seide to Moises, Lo! Y haue maad thee the god of Farao; and Aaron, thi brother, schal be thi prophete.
Thou schalt speke to Aaron alle thingis whiche Y comaunde to thee, and he schal speke to Farao, that he delyuere the sones of Israel fro his hond.
But Y schal make hard his herte, and Y schal multiplie my signes and merueils in the lond of Egipt, and he schal not here you;
and Y schal sende myn hond on Egipt, and Y schal lede out myn oost, and my puple, the sones of Israel, fro the lond of Egipt bi mooste domes;
and Egipcians schulen wite, that Y am the Lord, which haue holde forth myn hond on Egipt, and haue led out of the myddis of hem the sones of Israel.
And so Moises dide and Aaron; as the Lord comaundide, so thei diden.
Forsothe Moyses was of fourescoor yeer, and Aaron was of fourescoor yeer and thre, whanne thei spaken to Farao.
And the Lord seide to Moises and to Aaron,
Whanne Farao schal seie to you, Schewe ye signes to vs, thou schalt seie to Aaron, Take thi yerde, and caste forth it before Farao, and be it turned into a serpent.
And so Moises and Aaron entriden to Farao, and diden as the Lord comaundide; and Aaron took the yeerde, and castide forth bifore Farao and hise seruauntis, which yerde was turned in to a serpent.
Forsothe Farao clepide wise men, and witchis, and thei also diden bi enchauntementis of Egipt, and bi summe priuy thingis in lijk maner;
and alle castiden forth her yerdis, whiche weren turned in to dragouns; but the yerde of Aaron deuouride `the yerdis of hem.
And the herte of Farao was maad hard, and he herde not hem, as the Lord comaundide.
Forsothe the Lord seide to Moyses, The herte of Farao is maad greuouse, he nyle delyuere the puple;
go thou to hym eerli; lo! he schal go out to the watris, and thou schalt stonde in the comyng of hym on the brynke of the flood; and thou schalt take in thin honde the yerde, that was turned into a dragoun,
and thou schalt seie to hym, The Lord God of Ebrews sente me to thee, and seide, Delyuere thou my puple, that it make sacrifice to me in desert; til to present time thou noldist here.
Therfor the Lord seith these thingis, In this thou schalt wite, that Y am the Lord; lo! Y schal smyte with the yerde, which is in myn hond, the watir of the flood, and it schal be turned in to blood;
and the fischis that ben in the flood schulen die; and the watris schulen wexe rotun, and Egipcians drynkynge the watir of the flood schulen be turmentid.
Also the Lord seide to Moises, Seie thou to Aaron, Take thi yerde, and holde forth thin hond on the watris of Egipt, and on the flodis of hem, and on the stremys `of hem, and on the mareis, and alle lakis of watris, that tho be turned in to blood; and blood be in al the lond of Egipt, as wel in vessils of tree as of stoon.
And Moises and Aaron diden so, as the Lord comaundide; and Aaron reiside the yerde, and smoot the watir of the flood bifore Farao and hise seruauntis, which watir was turned in to blood;
and fischis, that weren in the flood, dieden; and the flood was rotun, and Egipcians myyten not drynke the water of the flood; and blood was in al the lond of Egipt.
And the witchis of Egipcians diden in lijk maner by her enchauntementis; and the herte of Farao was maad hard, and he herde not hem, as the Lord comaundide.
And he turnede awei hym silf, and entride in to his hows, nethir he took it to herte, yhe, in this tyme.
Forsothe alle Egipcians diggiden watir `bi the cumpas of the flood, to drinke; for thei myyten not drynke of the `watir of the flood.
And seuene daies weren fillid, aftir that the Lord smoot the flood.

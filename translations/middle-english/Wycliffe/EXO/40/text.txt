And the Lord spak to Moises, `and seide,
In the firste monethe, in the firste dai of the monethe, thou schalt reise the tabernacle of witnessyng.
And thou schalt sette the arke therynne, and thou schalt leeue a veil bifore it.
And whanne the bord is borun yn, thou schalt sette ther onne tho thingis, that ben comaundid iustli. The candilstike schal stonde with hise lanternes,
and the goldun auter, where ynne encense is brent bifor the arke of witnessyng. Thou schalt sette a tente in the entryng of the tabernacle;
and bifor it the auter of brent sacrifice,
the `waischyng vessel bitwixe the auter and the tabernacle, which `waischyng vessel thou schalt fille with water.
And thou schalt cumpas the greet street, and the entryng ther of with tentis.
And whanne thou hast take oyle of anoyntyng, thou schalt anoynte the tabernacle, with hise vessels, that tho be halewid;

And thou schalt present Aaron and hise sones to the dore of the tabernacle of witnessyng;
and, whanne thei ben `waischid in water, thou schalt clothe hem with hooli clothis, that thei mynystre to me, and that the anoyntyng of hem profite in to euerlastynge preesthod.
And Moises dide alle thingis whiche the Lord comaundide.
Therfor in the firste monethe of the secunde yeer, in the firste dai of the monethe, the tabernacle was set.
And Moises reiside it, and settide the tablis, and foundementis, and barris, and he ordeynede pilers;
and `spredde abrood the roof on the tabernacle, and puttide an hilyng aboue, as the Lord comaundide.
He puttide also the witnessyng in the arke, and he settide barris with ynne, and Goddis answeryng place aboue.
And whanne he hadde brouyt the arke in to the tabernacle, he hangide a veil bifor it, that he schulde fille the comaundement of the Lord.
He settide also the boord in the tabernacle of witnessyng, at the north coost, without the veil,
and he ordeynede the looues of settyng forth bifore, as the Lord comaundide to Moises.
He settide also the candilstike in the tabernacle of witnessyng, euene ayens the boord,
in the south side, and settide lanternes bi ordre, bi the comaundement of the Lord.
He puttide also the goldun auter vndur the roof of witnessyng,
ayens the veil, and he brente theronne encense of swete smellynge spiceries, as the Lord comaundide to Moises.
He settide also a tente in the entryng of the tabernacle,
and the auter of brent sacrifice in the porche of the witnessyng, and he offride therynne brent sacrifice, and sacrifices, as the Lord comaundide.
Also he ordeynede the `waischyng vessel, bitwixe the tabernacle of witnessyng and the auter, and fillide it with watir.
And Moises, and Aaron, and his sones, waischiden her hondis and feet,
whanne thei entriden into the roof of boond of pees, and neiyeden to the auter, as the Lord comaundide to Moises.
He reiside also the greet street, bi the cumpas of the tabernacle and of the auter, and settyde a tente in the entryng therof. Aftir that alle thingis weren perfitli maad,
a cloude hilide the tabernacle of witnessyng, and the glorie of the Lord fillide it;
nether Moyses myyte entre in to the tabernacle of the boond of pees, while the cloude hilide alle thingis, and the maieste of the Lord schynede, for the cloude hilide alle thingis.
If ony tyme the cloude lefte the tabernacle, the sones of Israel yeden forth bi her cumpanyes;
if the cloude hangide aboue, thei dwelliden in the same place;
for the cloude of the Lord restide on the tabernacle bi dai, and fier in the nyyt, in the siyt of the puplis of Israel, bi alle her dwellyngis.

The title of the nyntenthe salm. To victorie, the salm of Dauid.
The Lord here thee in the dai of tribulacioun; the name of God of Jacob defende thee.
Sende he helpe to thee fro the hooli place; and fro Syon defende he thee.
Be he myndeful of al thi sacrifice; and thi brent sacrifice be maad fat.
Yyue he to thee aftir thin herte; and conferme he al thi counsel.
We schulen be glad in thin helthe; and we schulen be magnyfied in the name of oure God.
The Lord fille alle thin axyngis; nowe Y haue knowe, that the Lord hath maad saaf his crist. He schal here hym fro his hooly heuene; the helthe of his riyt hond is in poweris.
Thes in charis, and these in horsis; but we schulen inwardli clepe in the name of oure Lord God.
Thei ben boundun, and felden doun; but we han rise, and ben reisid.
Lord, make thou saaf the kyng; and here thou vs in the dai in which we inwardli clepen thee.

Thou that gouernest Israel, yyue tent; that leedist forth Joseph as a scheep. Thou that sittist on cherubym; be schewid bifore Effraym,
Beniamyn, and Manasses. Stire thi power, and come thou; that thou make vs saaf.
God of vertues, turne thou vs; and schewe thi face, and we schulen be saaf.
Lord God of vertues; hou longe schalt thou be wrooth on the preier of thi seruaunt?
Hou longe schalt thou feede vs with the breed of teeris; and schalt yyue drynke to vs with teeris in mesure?
Thou hast set vs in to ayenseiyng to oure neiyboris; and oure enemyes han scornyde vs.
God of vertues, turne thou vs; and schewe thi face, and we schulen be saaf.
Thou translatidist a vyne fro Egipt; thou castidist out hethene men, and plauntidist it.
Thou were leeder of the weie in the siyt therof; and thou plauntidist the rootis therof, and it fillide the lond.
The schadewe therof hilide hillis; and the braunchis therof filliden the cedris of God.
It streiyte forth hise siouns til to the see, and the generacioun ther of `til to the flood.
Whi hast thou destried the wal therof; and alle men that goen forth bi the weie gaderiden awei the grapis therof?
A boor of the wode distriede it; and a singuler wielde beeste deuouride it.
God of vertues, be thou turned; biholde thou fro heuene, and se, and visite this vyne.
And make thou it perfit, which thi riythond plauntide; and biholde thou on the sone of man, which thou hast confermyd to thee.
Thingis brent with fier, and vndurmyned; schulen perische for the blamyng of thi cheer.
Thin hond be maad on the man of thi riythond; and on the sone of man, whom thou hast confermed to thee.
And we departiden not fro thee; thou schalt quykene vs, and we schulen inwardli clepe thi name.
Lord God of vertues, turne thou vs; and schewe thi face, and we schulen be saaf.

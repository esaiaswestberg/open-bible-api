The title of the oon and fiftithe salm. To victorie, the salm of Dauid,
`whanne Doech Idumei cam, and telde to Saul, and seide to him, Dauid cam in to the hows of Abymelech.
What hast thou glorie in malice; which art miyti in wickidnesse?
Al dai thi tunge thouyte vnriytfulnesse; as a scharp rasour thou hast do gile.
Thou louedist malice more than benygnite; `thou louedist wickidnesse more than to speke equite.
Thou louedist alle wordis of casting doun; with a gileful tunge.
Therfor God schal distrie thee in to the ende, he schal drawe thee out bi the roote, and he schal make thee to passe awei fro thi tabernacle; and thi roote fro the lond of lyuynge men.
Iust men schulen se, and schulen drede; and thei schulen leiye on hym, and thei schulen seie, Lo!
the man that settide not God his helpere. But he hopide in the multitude of his richessis; and hadde maistrie in his vanite.
Forsothe Y, as a fruytful olyue tre in the hous of God; hopide in the merci of God with outen ende, and in to the world of world.
Y schal knowleche to thee in to the world, for thou hast do mercy to me; and Y schal abide thi name, for it is good in the siyt of thi seyntis.

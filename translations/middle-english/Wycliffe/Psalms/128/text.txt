The `title of the hundrid and eiyte and twentithe `salm. The song of greces. Israel seie now; Ofte thei fouyten ayens me fro my yongth.
Ofte thei fouyten ayens me fro my yongthe; and sotheli thei miyten not to me.
Synneris forgeden on my bak; thei maden long her wickidnesse.
The `iust Lord schal beete the nollis of synneris;
alle that haten Sion be schent, and turned abak.
Be thei maad as the hey of hous coppis; that driede vp, bifore that it be drawun vp.
Of which hei he that schal repe, schal not fille his hond; and he that schal gadere hondfullis, schal not fille his bosum.
And thei that passiden forth seiden not, The blessing of the Lord be on you; we blessiden you in the name of the Lord.

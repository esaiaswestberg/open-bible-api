It is wel plesaunt to the Lord on men that dreden hym; and in hem that hopen on his mercy.
Jerusalem, herie thou the Lord; Syon, herie thou thi God.
For he hath coumfortid the lockis of thi yatis; he hath blessid thi sones in thee.
Which hath set thi coostis pees; and fillith thee with the fatnesse of wheete.
Which sendith out his speche to the erthe; his word renneth swiftli.
Which yyueth snow as wolle; spredith abrood a cloude as aische.
He sendith his cristal as mussels; who schal suffre bifore the face of his cooldnesse?
He schal sende out his word, and schal melte tho; his spirit schal blowe, and watris schulen flowe.
Which tellith his word to Jacob; and hise riytfulnessis and domes to Israel. He dide not so to ech nacioun; and he schewide not hise domes to hem.

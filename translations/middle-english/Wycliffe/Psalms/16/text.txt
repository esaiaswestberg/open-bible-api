The title of the sixtenthe salm. The preier of Dauid. Lord, here thou my riytfulnesse; biholde thou my preier. Perseuye thou with eeris my preier; not maad in gileful lippis.
Mi doom come `forth of thi cheer; thin iyen se equite.
Thou hast preued myn herte, and hast visitid in niyt; thou hast examynyd me bi fier, and wickidnesse is not foundun in me.
That my mouth speke not the werkis of men; for the wordis of thi lippis Y haue kept harde weies.
Make thou perfit my goyngis in thi pathis; that my steppis be not moued.
I criede, for thou, God, herdist me; bowe doun thin eere to me, and here thou my wordis.
Make wondurful thi mercies; that makist saaf `men hopynge in thee.
Kepe thou me as the appil of the iye; fro `men ayenstondynge thi riyt hond. Keuere thou me vndur the schadewe of thi wyngis;
fro the face of vnpitouse men, that han turmentid me. Myn enemyes han cumpassid my soule;
thei han closide togidere her fatnesse; the mouth of hem spak pride.
Thei castiden me forth, and han cumpassid me now; thei ordeyneden to bowe doun her iyen in to erthe.
Thei, as a lioun maad redi to prey, han take me; and as the whelp of a lioun dwellynge in hid places.
Lord, rise thou vp, bifor come thou hym, and disseyue thou hym; delyuere thou my lijf fro the `vnpitouse,
delyuere thou thi swerd fro the enemyes of thin hond. Lord, departe thou hem fro a fewe men of `the lond in the lijf of hem; her wombe is fillid of thin hid thingis. Thei ben fillid with sones; and thei leften her relifis to her litle children.
But Y in riytfulnesse schal appere to thi siyt; Y schal be fillid, whanne thi glorie schal appere.

The `title of the hundrid and foure and twentithe salm. `The song of greces. Thei that tristen in the Lord ben as the hil of Syon; he schal not be moued with outen ende,
that dwellith in Jerusalem. Hillis ben in the cumpas of it, and the Lord is in the cumpas of his puple; fro this tyme now and in to the world.
For the Lord schal not leeue the yerde of synneris on the part of iust men; that iust men holde not forth her hondis to wickidnesse.
Lord, do thou wel; to good men, and of riytful herte.
But the Lord schal lede them that bowen in to obligaciouns, with hem that worchen wickidnesse; pees be on Israel.

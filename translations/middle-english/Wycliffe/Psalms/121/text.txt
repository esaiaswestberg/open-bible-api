The `title of the hundrid and oon and twentithe salm. The song of the grecis of Dauid. I am glad in these thingis, that ben seid to me; We schulen go in to the hous of the Lord.
Oure feet weren stondynge; in thi hallis, thou Jerusalem.
Jerusalem, which is bildid as a citee; whos part taking therof is in to the same thing.
For the lynagis, the lynagis of the Lord stieden thidir, the witnessing of Israel; to knouleche to the name of the Lord.
For thei saten there on seetis in doom; seetis on the hous of Dauid.
Preie ye tho thingis, that ben to the pees of Jerusalem; and abundaunce be to hem that louen thee.
Pees be maad in thi vertu; and abundaunce in thi touris.
For my britheren and my neiyboris; Y spak pees of thee.
For the hous of oure Lord God; Y souyte goodis to thee.

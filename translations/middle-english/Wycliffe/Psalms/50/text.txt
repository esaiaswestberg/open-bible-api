The title of the fiftithe salm. To victorie, the salm of Dauid;
`whanne Nathan the prophete cam to hym, whanne he entride to Bersabee.
God, haue thou merci on me; bi thi greet merci. And bi the mychilnesse of thi merciful doyngis; do thou awei my wickidnesse.
More waische thou me fro my wickidnesse; and clense thou me fro my synne.
For Y knouleche my wickidnesse; and my synne is euere ayens me.
I haue synned to thee aloone, and Y haue do yuel bifor thee; that thou be iustified in thi wordis, and ouercome whanne thou art demed. For lo!
Y was conseyued in wickednessis; and my modir conceyuede me in synnes.
For lo! thou louedist treuthe; thou hast schewid to me the vncerteyn thingis, and pryuy thingis of thi wisdom.
Lord, sprenge thou me with ysope, and Y schal be clensid; waische thou me, and Y schal be maad whijt more than snow.
Yyue thou ioie, and gladnesse to myn heryng; and boonys maad meke schulen ful out make ioye.
Turne awei thi face fro my synnes; and do awei alle my wickidnesses.
God, make thou a clene herte in me; and make thou newe a riytful spirit in my entrailis.
Caste thou me not awei fro thi face; and take thou not awei fro me thin hooli spirit.
Yiue thou to me the gladnesse of thyn helthe; and conferme thou me with the principal spirit.
I schal teche wickid men thi weies; and vnfeithful men schulen be conuertid to thee.
God, the God of myn helthe, delyuere thou me fro bloodis; and my tunge schal ioyfuli synge thi riytfulnesse.
Lord, `opene thou my lippis; and my mouth schal telle thi preysyng.
For if thou haddist wold sacrifice, Y hadde youe; treuli thou schalt not delite in brent sacrifices.
A sacrifice to God is a spirit troblid; God, thou schalt not dispise a contrit herte and `maad meke.
Lord, do thou benygneli in thi good wille to Syon; that the wallis of Jerusalem be bildid.
Thanne thou schalt take plesauntli the sacrifice of riytfulnesse, offryngis, and brent sacrifices; thanne thei schulen putte calues on thin auter.

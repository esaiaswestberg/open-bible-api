Lord, who schal dwelle in thi tabernacle; ether who schal reste in thin hooli hil?
He that entrith with out wem; and worchith riytfulnesse.
Which spekith treuthe in his herte; which dide not gile in his tunge. Nethir dide yuel to his neiybore; and took not schenschip ayens hise neiyboris.
A wickid man is brouyt to nouyt in his siyt; but he glorifieth hem that dreden the Lord. Which swerith to his neiybore, and disseyueth not;
which yaf not his money to vsure; and took not yiftis on the innocent. He, that doith these thingis, schal not be moued with outen ende.

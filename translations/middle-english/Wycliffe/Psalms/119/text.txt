The `title of the hundrid and nyntenthe salm. The song of greces. Whanne Y was set in tribulacioun, Y criede to the Lord; and he herde me.
Lord, delyuere thou my soule fro wickid lippis; and fro a gileful tunge.
What schal be youun to thee, ether what schal be leid to thee; to a gileful tunge?
Scharpe arowis of the myyti; with colis that maken desolat.
Allas to me! for my dwelling in an alien lond is maad long, Y dwellide with men dwellinge in Cedar; my soule was myche a comelyng.
I was pesible with hem that hatiden pees;
whanne Y spak to hem, thei ayenseiden me with outen cause.

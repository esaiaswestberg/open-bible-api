The `title of the hundrid and tenthe salm. Alleluya. Lord, Y schal knouleche to thee in al myn herte; in the counsel and congregacioun of iust men.
The werkis of the Lord ben greete; souyt out in to alle hise willis.
His werk is knoulechyng and grete doyng; and his riytfulnesse dwellith in to the world of world.
The Lord merciful in wille, and a merciful doere, hath maad a mynde of hise merueilis;
he hath youe meete to men dredynge hym. He schal be myndeful of his testament in to the world;
he schal telle to his puple the vertu of hise werkis.
That he yyue to hem the eritage of folkis; the werkis of hise hondis ben treuthe and doom.
Alle hise comaundementis ben feithful, confermed in to the world of world; maad in treuthe and equite.
The Lord sente redempcioun to hys puple; he comaundide his testament with outen ende. His name is hooli and dreedful;
the bigynnyng of wisdom is the drede of the Lord. Good vndirstondyng is to alle that doen it; his preising dwellith in to the world of world.

The titil of the foure and sixtithe salm. `To victorie, `the salm of the song of Dauid.
God, heriyng bicometh thee in Syon; and a vow schal be yolden to thee in Jerusalem.
Here thou my preier; ech man schal come to thee.
The wordis of wickid men hadden the maistrye ouer vs; and thou schalt do merci to oure wickidnessis.
Blessid is he, whom thou hast chose, and hast take; he schal dwelle in thin hallis. We schulen be fillid with the goodis of thin hous;
thi temple is hooli, wondurful in equite. God, oure heelthe, here thou vs; thou art hope of alle coostis of erthe, and in the see afer.
And thou makest redi hillis in thi vertu, and art gird with power;
which disturblist the depthe of the see, the soun of the wawis therof.
Folkis schulen be disturblid, and thei that dwellen in the endis schulen drede of thi signes; thou schalt delite the outgoingis of the morewtid and euentid.
Thou hast visitid the lond, and hast greetli fillid it; thou hast multiplied to make it riche. The flood of God was fillid with watris; thou madist redi the mete of hem, for the makyng redi therof is so.
Thou fillynge greetli the stremes therof, multiplie the fruytis therof; the lond bringinge forth fruytis schal be glad in goteris of it.
Thou schalt blesse the coroun of the yeer of thi good wille; and thi feeldis schulen be fillid with plentee of fruytis.
The feire thingis of desert schulen wexe fatte; and litle hillis schulen be cumpassid with ful out ioiyng.
The wetheris of scheep ben clothid, and valeis schulen be plenteuouse of wheete; thei schulen crye, and sotheli thei schulen seye salm.

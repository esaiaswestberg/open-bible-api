The title of the seuenetenthe salm. To victorie, the word of the Lord to Dauid; which spak the wordis of this song, in the dai in which the Lord delyuerede hym fro the hond of alle hise enemyes, and fro the hond of Saul; and he seide:
Lord, my strengthe, Y schal loue thee; the Lord is my stidfastnesse, and my refuyt, and mi deliuerere.
Mi God is myn helpere; and Y schal hope in to hym. My defendere, and the horn of myn helthe; and myn vptakere.
I schal preise, and ynwardli clepe the Lord; and Y schal be saaf fro myn enemyes.
The sorewis of deth cumpassiden me; and the strondis of wickidnesse disturbliden me.
The sorewis of helle cumpassiden me; the snaris of deeth `bifor ocupieden me.
In my tribulacioun Y inwardli clepide the Lord; and Y criede to my God. And he herde my vois fro his hooli temple; and my cry in his siyt entride in to hise eeris.
The erthe was mouede togidere, and tremblede togidere; the foundementis of hillis weren troblid togidere, and weren moued togidere; for he was wrooth to hem.
Smoke stiede in the ire of hym, and fier brente out fro his face; coolis weren kyndlid of hym.
He bowide doun heuenes, and cam doun; and derknesse was vndur hise feet.
And he stiede on cherubym, and flei; he fley ouer the pennes of wyndis.
And he settide derknesses his hidyng place, his tabernacle `in his cumpas; derk water was in the cloudes of the lowere eir.
Ful cleer cloudis passiden in his siyt; hail and the coolis of fier.
And the Lord thundrid fro heuene; and the hiyeste yaf his vois, hail and the coolis of fier `camen doun.
And he sente hise arowis, and distriede tho men; he multipliede leytis, and disturblide tho men.
And the wellis of watris apperiden; and the foundementis of the erthe weren schewid. Lord, of thi blamyng; of the brething of the spirit of thin ire.
He sente fro the hiyeste place, and took me; and he took me fro many watris.
He delyuerede me fro my strongeste enemyes; and fro hem that hatiden me, fro thei weren coumfortid on me.
Thei camen bifor me in the dai of my turment; and the Lord was maad my defendere.
And he ledde out me in to breede; he maad me saaf, for he wolde me.
And the Lord schal yelde to me bi my riytfulnesse; and he schal yelde to me bi the clennesse of myn hondis.
For Y kepte the weies of the Lord; and Y dide not vnfeithfuli fro my God.
For alle hise domes ben in my siyt; and Y puttide not awei fro me hise riytfulnessis.
And Y schal be vnwemmed with hym; and Y schal kepe me fro my wickidnesse.
And the Lord schal yelde to me bi my riytfulnesse; and bi the clennesse of myn hondis in the siyt of hise iyen.
With the hooli, thou schalt be hooli; and with `a man innocent, thou schalt be innocent.
And with a chosun man, thou schalt be chosun; and with a weiward man, thou schalt be weiward.
For thou schalt make saaf a meke puple; and thou schalt make meke the iyen of proude men.
For thou, Lord, liytnest my lanterne; my God, liytne thou my derknessis.
For bi thee Y schal be delyuered fro temptacioun; and in my God Y schal `go ouer the wal.
Mi God, his weie is vndefoulid, the speches of the Lord ben examyned bi fier; he is defendere of alle men hopynge in hym.
For whi, who is God out takun the Lord? ethir who is God outakun oure God?
God that hath gird me with vertu; and hath set my weie vnwemmed.
Which made perfit my feet as of hertis; and ordeynynge me on hiye thingis.
Which techith myn hondis to batel; and thou hast set myn armys as a brasun bouwe.
And thou hast youe to me the kyueryng of thin helthe; and thi riythond hath vptake me. And thi chastisyng amendide me in to the ende; and thilke chastisyng of thee schal teche me.
Thou alargidist my paaces vndur me; and my steppis ben not maad vnstidefast.
Y schal pursue myn enemyes, and Y schal take hem; and Y schal not turne til thei failen.
I schal al to-breke hem, and thei schulen not mowe stonde; thei schulen falle vndur my feet.
And thou hast gird me with vertu to batel; and thou hast `supplauntid, ether disseyued, vndur me men risynge ayens me.
And thou hast youe myn enemyes abac to me; and thou hast distried `men hatynge me.
Thei crieden, and noon was that maad hem saaf; `thei crieden to the Lord, and he herde not hem.
And Y schal al to-breke hem, as dust bifor the face of wynd; Y schal do hem awei, as the cley of stretis.
Thou schalt delyuere me fro ayenseiyngis of the puple; thou schalt sette me in to the heed of folkis.
The puple, which Y knewe not, seruede me; in the herynge of eere it obeiede to me.
Alien sones lieden to me, alien sones wexiden elde; and crokiden fro thi pathis.
The Lord lyueth, and my God be blessid; and the God of myn helthe be enhaunsid.
God, that yauest veniaunces to me, and makist suget puplis vndur me; my delyuerere fro my wrathful enemyes.
And thou schalt enhaunse me fro hem, that risen ayens me; thou schalt delyuere me fro a wickid man.
Therfor, Lord, Y schal knouleche to thee among naciouns; and Y schal seie salm to thi name.
Magnyfiynge the helthis of his kyng; and doynge merci to his crist Dauid, and to his seed til in to the world.

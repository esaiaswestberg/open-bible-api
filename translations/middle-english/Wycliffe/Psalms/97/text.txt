The seuen and nyntithe salm hath no title. Singe ye a newe song to the Lord; for he hath do merueils. His riyt hond and his hooli arm; hath maad heelthe to hym.
The Lord hath maad knowun his heelthe; in the siyt of hethene men he hath schewid his riytfulnesse.
He bithouyte on his merci; and on his treuthe, to the hous of Israel. Alle the endis of erthe; sien the heelthe of oure God.
Al erthe, make ye hertli ioye to God; synge ye, and make ye ful out ioye, and seie ye salm.
Singe ye to the Lord in an harpe, in harpe and vois of salm;
in trumpis betun out with hamer, and in vois of a trumpe of horn. Hertli synge ye in the siyt of the Lord, the king; the see and the fulnesse therof be moued;
the world, and thei that dwellen therynne.
Flodis schulen make ioie with hond, togidere hillis schulen make ful out ioye, for siyt of the Lord;
for he cometh to deme the erthe. He schal deme the world in riytfulnesse; and puplis in equite.

The `title of the hundrid and nyne and thrittithe `salm. To victorie, the salm of Dauith.
Lord, delyuere thou me fro an yuel man; delyuere thou me fro a wickid man.
Whiche thouyten wickidnesses in the herte; al dai thei ordeyneden batels.
Thei scharpiden her tungis as serpentis; the venym of snakis vndir the lippis of hem.
Lord, kepe thou me fro the hond of the synnere; and delyuere thou me fro wickid men. Which thouyten to disseyue my goyngis;
proude men hidden a snare to me. And thei leiden forth cordis in to a snare; thei settiden sclaundir to me bisidis the weie.
I seide to the Lord, Thou art mi God; Lord, here thou the vois of my biseching.
Lord, Lord, the vertu of myn heelthe; thou madist schadowe on myn heed in the dai of batel.
Lord, bitake thou not me fro my desire to the synnere; thei thouyten ayens me, forsake thou not me, lest perauenture thei ben enhaunsid.
The heed of the cumpas of hem; the trauel of her lippis schal hile hem.
Colis schulen falle on hem, thou schalt caste hem doun in to fier; in wretchidnessis thei schulen not stonde.
A man a greet ianglere schal not be dressid in erthe; yuels schulen take an vniust man in perisching.
I haue knowe, that the Lord schal make dom of a nedi man; and the veniaunce of pore men.
Netheles iust men schulen knouleche to thi name; and riytful men schulen dwelle with thi cheer.

I bileuede, for which thing Y spak; forsoth Y was maad low ful myche.
I seide in my passing; Ech man is a lier.
What schal Y yelde to the Lord; for alle thingis which he yeldide to me?
I schal take the cuppe of heelthe; and Y schal inwardli clepe the name of the Lord.
I schal yelde my vowis to the Lord bifor al his puple;
the deth of seyntis of the Lord is precious in his siyt.
O! Lord, for Y am thi seruant; Y am thi seruaunt, and the sone of thi handmaide. Thou hast broke my bondys,
to thee Y schal offre a sacrifice of heriyng; and Y schal inwardli clepe the name of the Lord.
I schal yelde my vowis to the Lord, in the siyt of al his puple;
in the porchis of the hous of the Lord, in the myddil of thee, Jerusalem.

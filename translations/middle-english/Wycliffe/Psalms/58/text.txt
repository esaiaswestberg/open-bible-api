The title of the eiyte and fiftithe salm. `In Jeroms translacioun thus, To the ouercomer, that thou lese not Dauid, meke and simple, `whanne Saul sente and kepte the hous, to slee hym. `In Ebreu thus, To the ouercomyng, leese thou not the semeli song of Dauid, and so forth.
Mi God, delyuer thou me fro myn enemyes; and delyuer thou me fro hem that risen ayens me.
Delyuer thou me fro hem that worchen wickidnesse; and saue thou me fro menquelleris.
For lo! thei han take my soule; stronge men fellen in on me.
Nethir my wickidnesse, nether my synne; Lord, Y ran with out wickidnesse, and dresside `my werkis.
Rise vp thou in to my meetyng, and se; and thou, Lord God of vertues, art God of Israel. Yyue thou tent to visite alle folkis; do thou not merci to alle that worchen wickidnesse.
Thei schulen be turned at euentid, and thei as doggis schulen suffre hungir; and thei schulen cumpas the citee.
Lo! thei schulen speke in her mouth, and a swerd in her lippis; for who herde?
And thou, Lord, schalt scorne hem; thou schalt bringe alle folkis to nouyt.
I schal kepe my strengthe to thee;
for God is myn vptaker, my God, his mercy schal come byfore me.
God schewide to me on myn enemyes, slee thou not hem; lest ony tyme my puples foryete. Scatere thou hem in thi vertu; and, Lord, my defender, putte thou hem doun.
Putte thou doun the trespas of her mouth, and the word of her lippis; and be thei takun in her pride. And of cursyng and of leesyng; thei schulen be schewid in the endyng.
In the ire of ending, and thei schulen not be; and thei schulen wite, that the Lord schal be Lord of Jacob, and of the endis of erthe.
Thei schulen be turned at euentid, and thei as doggis schulen suffre hungur; and thei schulen cumpas the citee.
Thei schulen be scaterid abrood, for to eete; sotheli if thei ben not fillid, and thei schulen grutche.
But Y schal synge thi strengthe; and eerli Y schal enhaunse thi merci. For thou art maad myn vptaker; and my refuyt, in the dai of my tribulacioun.
Myn helper, Y schal synge to thee; for thou art God, myn vptaker, my God, my mercy.

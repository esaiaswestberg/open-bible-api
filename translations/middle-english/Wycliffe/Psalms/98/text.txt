The eiyte and nyntithe salm. The Lord hath regned, puplis ben wrooth; thou that sittist on cherubyn, the erthe be moued.
The Lord is greet in Sion; and hiy aboue alle puplis.
Knouleche thei to thi greet name, for it is ferdful and hooli;
and the onour of the king loueth doom. Thou hast maad redi dressyngis; thou hast maad doom and riytfulnesse in Jacob.
Enhaunse ye oure Lord God; and worschipe ye the stool of hise feet, for it is hooli.
Moises and Aaron weren among hise preestis; and Samuel was among hem that inwardli clepen his name. Thei inwardli clepiden the Lord, and he herde hem;
in a piler of cloude he spak to hem. Thei kepten hise witnessyngis; and the comaundement which he yaf to hem.
Oure Lord God, thou herdist hem; God, thou were merciful to hem, and thou tokist veniaunce on al her fyndyngis.
Enhaunse ye oure Lord God, and worschipe ye in his hooli hil; for oure Lord God is hooli.

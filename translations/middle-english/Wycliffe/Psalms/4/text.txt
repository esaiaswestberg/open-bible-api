The title of the fourthe salm. `To the victorie in orguns; the salm of Dauid.
Whanne Y inwardli clepid, God of my riytwisnesse herde me; in tribulacioun thou hast alargid to me.
Haue thou mercy on me; and here thou my preier. Sones of men, hou long ben ye of heuy herte? whi louen ye vanite, and seken a leesyng?
And wite ye, that the Lord hath maad merueilous his hooli man; the Lord schal here me, whanne Y schal crye to hym.
Be ye wrothe, and nyle ye do synne; `and for tho thingis whiche ye seien in youre hertis and in youre beddis, be ye compunct.
Sacrifie ye `the sacrifice of riytfulnesse, and hope ye in the Lord; many seien, Who schewide goodis to vs?
Lord, the liyt of thi cheer is markid on vs; thou hast youe gladnesse in myn herte.
Thei ben multiplied of the fruit of whete, and of wyn; and of her oile.
In pees in the same thing; Y schal slepe, and take reste.
For thou, Lord; hast set me syngulerli in hope.

And Y bithenke of that feith, that is in thee not feyned, which also dwellide firste in thin aunte Loide, and in thi modir Eunyce. And Y am certeyn, that also in thee.
For which cause Y moneste thee, that thou reise ayen the grace of God, that is in thee bi the settyng on of myn hondis.
For whi God yaf not to vs the spirit of drede, but of vertu, and of loue, and of sobrenesse.
Therfor nyl thou schame the witnessyng of oure Lord Jhesu Crist, nether me, his prisoner; but trauele thou togidere in the gospel bi the vertu of God;

For which cause also Y suffre these thingis; but Y am not confoundid. For Y woot to whom Y haue bileuyd, and Y am certeyne that he is miyti for to kepe that is take to my keping in to that dai.
Haue thou the fourme of hoolsum wordis, whiche thou herdist of me in feith and loue in Crist Jhesu.
Kepe thou the good takun to thi kepyng bi the Hooli Goost, that dwellith in vs.
Thou wost this, that alle that ben in Asie ben turnyd awey fro me, of whiche is Figelus and Ermogenes.
The Lord yyue merci to the hous of Onesyforus, for ofte he refreischide me, and schamyde not my chayne.
But whanne he cam to Rome, he souyte me bisili, and foond.

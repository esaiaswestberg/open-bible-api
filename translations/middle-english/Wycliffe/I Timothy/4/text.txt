But the spirit seith opynli, that in the laste tymes summen schulen departe fro the feith, yyuynge tent to spiritis of errour, and to techingis of deuelis; that speken leesing in ipocrisie,
and haue her conscience corrupt,
forbedinge to be weddid, to absteyne fro metis, whiche God made to take with doyng of thankingis, to feithful men, and hem that han knowe the treuthe.
For ech creature of God is good, and no thing is to be cast awei, which is takun with doyng of thankyngis;
for it is halewid bi the word of God, and bi preyer.
Thou puttynge forth these thingis to britheren, schalt be a good mynystre of Crist Jhesu; nurschid with wordis of feith and of good doctryne, which thou hast gete.
But eschewe thou vncouenable fablis, and elde wymmenus fablis; haunte thi silf to pitee.
For bodili exercitation is profitable to litle thing; but pitee is profitable to alle thingis, that hath a biheest of lijf that now is, and that is to come.
A trewe word, and worthi al acceptacioun.
And in this thing we trauelen, and ben cursid, for we hopen in lyuyng God, that is sauyour of alle men, moost of feithful men.
Comaunde thou this thing, and teche.
No man dispise thi yongthe, but be thou ensaumple of feithful men in word, in lyuyng, in charite, in feith, in chastite.
Tyl Y come, take tent to redyng, to exortacioun and teching.
Nyle thou litil charge the grace which is in thee, that is youun to thee bi profecie, with putting on of the hondis of preesthod.
Thenke thou these thingis, in these be thou, that thi profiting be schewid to alle men.
Take tent to thi silf and to doctryn; be bisi in hem. For thou doynge these thingis, schalt `make bothe thi silf saaf, and hem that heren thee.

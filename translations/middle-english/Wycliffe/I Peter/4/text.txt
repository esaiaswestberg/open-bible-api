Therfor for Crist suffride in fleisch, be ye also armed bi the same thenkynge; for he that suffride in fleisch ceesside fro synnes,
that that is left now in fleisch lyue not now to the desiris of men, but to the wille of God.
For the time that is passid is ynow to the wille of hethene men to be endid, whiche walkiden in letcheries, and lustis, in myche drinking of wyn, in vnmesurable etyngis, and drynkyngis, and vnleueful worschiping of mawmetis.
In whiche now thei ben astonyed, in which thing thei wondren, for ye rennen not togidere `in to the same confusioun of letcherie, and blasfemen.
And thei schulen yyue resoun to hym, that is redi to deme the quyke and the deed.
For whi for this thing it is prechid also to deed men, that thei be demed bi men in fleisch, and that thei lyue bi God in spirit.
For the ende of alle thingis schal neiye. Therfor be ye prudent, and wake ye in preyeris;
bifore alle thingis haue ye charite ech to other in you silf algatis lastynge; for charite couerith the multitude of synnes.
Holde ye hospitalite togidere with out grutching;
ech man as he hath resseyued grace, mynystringe it in to ech othere, as good dispenderis of the manyfold grace of God.
If ony man spekith, speke he as the wordis of God; if ony man mynystrith, as of the vertu which God mynystrith; that God be onourid in alle thingis bi Jhesu Crist oure Lord, to whom is glorie and lordschip in to worldis `of worldis.
Amen. Moost dere brytheren, nyle ye go in pilgrymage in feruour, that is maad to you to temptacioun, as if ony newe thing bifalle to you;
but comyne ye with the passiouns of Crist, and haue ye ioye, that also ye be glad, and haue ioye in the reuelacioun of his glorie.
If ye ben dispisid for the name of Crist, ye schulen be blessid; for that that is of the onour, and of the glorie, and of the vertu of God, and the spirit that is his, schal reste on you.
But no man of you suffre as a mansleere, ethir a theef, ether cursere, ethir a disirere of othere mennus goodis;
but if as a cristen man, schame he not, but glorifie he God in this name.
For tyme is, that doom bigynne at Goddis hous; and if it bigynne first at vs, what ende schal be of hem, that bileuen not to the gospel?
And if a iust man vnnethe schal be sauid, where schulen the vnfeithful man and the synnere appere? Therfor and thei that suffren bi the wille of God, bitaken her soulis in good dedis to the feithful makere of nouyt.

For whi indignacioun of the Lord is on alle folkis, and strong veniaunce on al the chyualrie of hem; he killide hem, and yaf hem in to sleyng.
The slayn men of hem schulen be cast forth, and stynk schal stie of the careyns of hem; hillis schulen flete of the blood of hem.
And al the chyualrie of heuenys schal faile, and heuenys schulen be foldid togidere as a book, and al the knyythod of tho schal flete doun, as the leef of a vyner and of a fige tre fallith doun.
For my swerd is fillid in heuene; lo! it schal come doun on Ydumee, and on the puple of my sleyng, to doom.
The swerd of the Lord is fillid of blood, it is maad fat of the ynner fatnesse of the blood of lambren and of buckis of geet, of the blood of rammes ful of merow; for whi the slayn sacrifice of the Lord is in Bosra, and greet sleyng is in the lond of Edom.
And vnycornes schulen go doun with hem, and bolis with hem that ben myyti; the lond of hem schal be fillid with blood, and the erthe of hem with ynnere fatnesse of fatte beestis;

And the strondis therof schulen be turned in to pitche, and the erthe therof in to brymstoon; and the lond therof schal be in to brennyng pitch, niyt and dai.

And thornes and nettlis schulen growe in the housis therof, and a tasil in the strengthis therof; and it schal be the couche of dragouns, and the lesewe of ostrichis.

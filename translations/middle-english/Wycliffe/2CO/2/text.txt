And Y ordeynede this ilke thing at me, that Y schulde not come eftsoone in heuynes to you.
For if Y make you sori, who is he that gladith me, but he that is soreuful of me?
And this same thing Y wroot to you, that whanne Y come, Y haue not sorewe on sorewe, of the whiche it behofte me to haue ioie. And Y triste in you alle, that my ioye is of alle you.
For of myche tribulacioun and angwisch of herte Y wroot to you by many teeris, not that ye be sori, but that ye wite what charite Y haue more plenteuously in you.
For if ony man hath maad me soreuful, he hath not maad me sorewful but a parti, that Y charge not you alle.
This blamyng that ys maad of manye, suffisith to hym, that is sich oon;
so that ayenward ye rathir foryyuen and coumfort, lest perauenture he that is suche a maner man, be sopun vp bi more grete heuynesse.
For which thing Y biseche you, that ye conferme charite in to hym.
For whi therfor Y wroot this, that Y knowe youre preuyng, whether in alle thingis ye ben obedient.
For to whom ye han foryyuen ony thing, also Y haue foryyue. For Y that that Y foryaf, yif Y foryaf ony thing, haue youun for you in the persone of Crist,
that we be not disseyued of Sathanas; for we knowen hise thouytis.
But whanne Y was comun to Troade for the gospel of Crist, and a dore was opened to me in the Lord,
Y hadde not rest to my spirit, for Y foond not my brother Tite, but Y seide to hem farewel, and Y passide in to Macedonye.
And Y do thankyngis to God, that euere more makith vs to haue victorie in Crist Jhesu, and schewith bi vs the odour of his knowing in ech place;
for we ben the good odour of Crist to God, among these that ben maad saaf, and among these that perischen.
To othere sotheli odour of deth in to deth, but to othere we ben odour of lijf in to lijf. And to these thingis who is so able?
For we ben not as many, that don auoutrie bi the word of God, but we speken of clennesse, as of God, bifor God in Crist.

And Petre seide to hym, Anany, whi hath Sathanas temptid thin herte, that thou lye to the Hooli Goost, and to defraude of the prijs of the feeld?
Whethir it vnseld was not thin; and whanne it was seld, it was in thi power? Whi hast thou put this thing in thin herte? Thou hast not lied to men, but to God.
Anany herde these wordis, and felde doun, and was deed. And greet drede was maad on alle that herden.

And ther was maad as a space of thre ouris, and his wijf knewe not that thing that was don, and entride.
And Petre answerde to hir, Womman, seie to me, whether ye seelden the feeld for so mych? And sche seide, Yhe, for so mych.
And Petre seide to hyr, What bifelde to you, to tempte the spirit of the Lord? Lo! the feet of hem that han birieden thin hosebonde ben at the dore, and thei schulen bere thee out.
Anoon sche felde doun at hise feet, and diede. And the yonge men entriden, and founden hir deed, and thei baren hir out, and birieden to hir hosebonde.

But the prince of preestis roos vp, and alle that weren with hym, that is the eresye of Saduceis, and weren fillid with enuye;
and leiden hondis on the apostlis, and puttiden hem in the comyn warde.
But the aungel of the Lord openyde bi nyyt the yatis of the prisoun, and ledde hem out, and seide, Go ye,
and stonde ye, and speke in the temple to the puple alle the wordis of this lijf.
Whom whanne thei hadden herd, thei entriden eerli in to the temple, and tauyten. And the prince of preestis cam, and thei that weren with him, and clepiden togidre the counsel, and alle the eldre men of the children of Israel; and senten to the prisoun, that thei schulden be brouyt forth.

And Petre answeride, and the apostlis, and seiden, It bihoueth to obeie to God, more than to men.
God of oure fadris reiside Jhesu, whom ye slowen, hangynge in a tre.
God enhaunside with his riythond this prince and sauyour, that penaunce were yyue to Israel, and remyssioun of synnes.
And we ben witnessis of these wordis, and the Hooli Goost, whom God yaf to alle obeischinge to him.

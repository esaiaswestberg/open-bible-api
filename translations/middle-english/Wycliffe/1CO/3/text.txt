And Y, britheren, myyte not speke to you as to spiritual men, but as to fleischli men;
as to litle children in Crist, Y yaf to you mylk drynke, not mete; for ye myyten not yit, nether ye moun now, for yit ye ben fleischli.
For while strijf is among you, whether ye ben not fleischli, and ye gon aftir man?
For whanne summe seith, Y am of Poul, another, But Y am of Apollo, whethir ye ben not men? What therfor is Apollo, and what Poul?
Thei ben mynystris of hym, to whom ye han bileuyd; and to ech man as God hath youun.
Y plauntide, Apollo moystide, but God yaf encreessyng.
Therfor nether he that plauntith is ony thing, nethir he that moistith, but God that yiueth encreessyng.
And he that plauntith, and he that moistith, ben oon; and ech schal take his owne mede, aftir his trauel.
For we ben the helperis of God; ye ben the erthetiliyng of God, ye ben the bildyng of God.
Aftir the grace `of God that is youun to me, as a wise maistir carpenter Y settide the foundement; and another bildith aboue. But ech man se, hou he bildith aboue.
For no man may sette another foundement, outtakun that that is sett, which is Crist Jhesus.
For if ony bildith ouer this foundement, gold, siluer, preciouse stoonys, stickis, hey, or stobil, euery mannus werk schal be open;
for the dai of the Lord schal declare, for it schal be schewid in fier; the fier schal preue the werk of ech man, what maner werk it is.
If the werk of ony man dwelle stille, which he bildide aboue, he schal resseyue mede.
If ony mannus werk brenne, he schal suffre harm; but he schal be saaf, so netheles as bi fier.
Witen ye not, that ye ben the temple of God, and the spirit of God dwellith in you?
And if ony defoulith the temple of God, God schal leese hym; for the temple of God is hooli, which ye ben.
No man disseyue hym silf. If ony man among you is seyn to be wiys in this world, be he maad a fool, that he be wijs.
For the wisdom of this world is foli anentis God; for it is writun, Y schal catche wise men in her fel wisdom;
and eft, The Lord knowith the thouytis of wise men, for tho ben veyn.
Therfor no man haue glorie in men.
For alle thingis ben youre, ethir Poul, ether Apollo, ether Cefas, ether the world, ether lijf, ether deth, ether thingis present, ethir thingis to comynge; for alle thingis ben youre,
and ye ben of Crist, and Crist is of God.

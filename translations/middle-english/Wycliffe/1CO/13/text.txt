If Y speke with tungis of men and of aungels, and Y haue not charite, Y am maad as bras sownynge, or a cymbal tynkynge.
And if Y haue prophecie, and knowe alle mysteries, and al kunnynge, and if Y haue al feith, so that Y meue hillis fro her place, and Y haue not charite, Y am nouyt.
And if Y departe alle my goodis in to the metis of pore men, and yf Y bitake my bodi, so that Y brenne, and if Y haue not charite, it profitith to me no thing.
Charite is pacient, it is benygne; charite enuyeth not, it doith not wickidli, it is not blowun,
it is not coueytouse, it sekith not tho thingis that ben hise owne, it is not stirid to wraththe, it thenkith not yuel,
it ioyeth not on wickidnesse, but it ioieth togidere to treuthe;
it suffrith alle thingis, it bileueth alle thingis, it hopith alle thingis, it susteyneth alle thingis.
Charite fallith neuere doun, whether prophecies schulen be voidid, ethir langagis schulen ceesse, ethir science schal be distried.
For a parti we knowun, and a parti we prophecien;
but whanne that schal come that is parfit, that thing that is of parti schal be auoidid.
Whanne Y was a litil child, Y spak as a litil child, Y vndurstood as a litil child, Y thouyte as a litil child; but whanne Y was maad a man, Y auoidide tho thingis that weren of a litil child.
And we seen now bi a myrour in derknesse, but thanne face to face; now Y knowe of parti, but thanne Y schal knowe, as Y am knowun.
And now dwellen feith, hope, and charite, these thre; but the most of these is charite.

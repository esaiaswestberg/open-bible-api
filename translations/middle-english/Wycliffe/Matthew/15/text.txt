Thanne the scribis and the Farisees camen to hym fro Jerusalem, and seiden,
Whi breken thi disciplis the tradiciouns of eldere men? for thei waisschen not her hondis, whanne thei eten breed.
He answeride, and seide to hem, Whi breken ye the maundement of God for youre tradicioun?
For God seide, Honoure thi fadir and thi modir, and he that cursith fadir or modir, die bi deeth.
But ye seien, Who euer seith to fadir or modir, What euere yifte is of me, it schal profite to thee;
and he hath not worschipid his fadir or his modir; and ye han maad the maundement of God voide for youre tradicioun.
Ypocritis, Isaie, the prophete, prophesiede wel of you,

Suffre ye hem; thei ben blynde, and leederis of blynde men. And if a blynd man lede a blynd man, bothe fallen doun in to the diche.
Petre answeride, and seide to hym, Expowne to vs this parable.
And he seide, Yit `ye ben also with oute vndurstondyng?
Vndurstonden ye not, that al thing that entrith in to the mouth, goith in to the wombe, and is sent out in to the goyng awei?
But tho thingis that comen forth fro the mouth, goon out of the herte, and tho thingis defoulen a man.
For of the herte goon out yuele thouytis, mansleyngis, auowtries, fornycaciouns, theftis, fals witnessyngis, blasfemyes.
Thes thingis it ben that defoulen a man; but to ete with hondis not waischun, defoulith not a man.
And Jhesus yede out fro thennus, and wente in to the coostis of Tire and Sidon.
And lo! a womman of Canane yede out of tho coostis, and criede, and seide to him, Lord, the sone of Dauid, haue merci on me; my douyter is yuel traueilid of a feend.

He answeride, and seide, Y am not sent, but to the scheep of the hous of Israel that perischiden.
And she cam, and worschipide hym, and seide, Lord, helpe me.
Which answeride, and seide, It is not good to take the breed of children, and caste to houndis.
And she seide, Yhis, Lord; for whelpis eten of the crummes, that fallen doun fro the bord of her lordis.
Thanne Jhesus answeride, and seide to hir, A! womman, thi feith is greet; be it doon to thee, as thou wolt. And hir douytir was helid fro that hour.
And whanne Jhesus hadde passed fro thennus, he cam bisidis the see of Galilee. And he yede vp in to an hil, and sat there.
And myche puple cam to hym, and hadden with hem doumbe men and crokid, feble and blynde, and many other; and thei castiden doun hem at hise feet. And he helide hem,
so that the puple wondriden seynge doumbe men spekynge, and crokid goynge, blynde men seynge; and thei magnyfieden God of Israel.

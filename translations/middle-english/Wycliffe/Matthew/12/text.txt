In that tyme Jhesus wente bi cornes in the sabot day; and hise disciplis hungriden, and bigunnen to plucke the eris of corn, and to ete.
And Fariseis, seynge, seiden to hym, Lo! thi disciplis don that thing that is not leueful to hem to do in sabatis.
And he seide to hem, Whether ye han not red, what Dauid dide, whanne he hungride, and thei that weren with hym?
hou he entride in to the hous of God, and eet looues of proposicioun, whiche looues it was not leueful to hym to ete, nether to hem that weren with hym, but to prestis aloone?
Or whether ye han not red in the lawe, that in sabotis prestis in the temple defoulen the sabotis, and thei ben with oute blame?
And Y seie to you, that here is a gretter than the temple.
And if ye wisten, what it is, Y wole merci, and not sacrifice, ye schulden neuer haue condempned innocentis.
For mannus Sone is lord, yhe, of the sabat.
And whanne he passide fro thennus, he cam in to the synagoge of hem.
And lo! a man that hadde a drye hoond. And thei axiden hym, and seiden, Whether it be leueful to hele in the sabot? that thei schulden acuse hym.
And he seide to hem, What man of you schal be, that hath o scheep, and if it falle in to a diche in the sabotis, whether he shal not holde, and lifte it vp?
How myche more is a man better than a scheep? Therfor it is leueful to do good in the sabatis.
Thanne he seide to the man, Stretche forth thin hoond. And he strauyte forth; and it was restorid to heelthe as the tothir.
And the Farisees wenten out, and maden a counsel ayens hym, hou thei schulden distrie hym.
And Jhesus knewe it, and wente awei fro thennus; and many sueden hym, and he helide hem alle.
And he comaundide to hem, that thei schulden not make hym knowun;
that that thing were fulfillid, that was seid by Isaie, the prophete, seiynge, Lo!
my child, whom Y haue chosun, my derling, in whom it hath wel plesid to my soule; Y shal put my spirit on him, and he shal telle dom to hethen men.
He shal not stryue, ne crye, nethir ony man shal here his voice in stretis.
A brisid rehed he shal not breke, and he schal not quenche smokynge flax, til he caste out doom to victorie;
and hethene men schulen hope in his name.
Thanne a man blynde and doumbe, that hadde a feend, was brouyt to hym; and he helide hym, so that he spak, and say.
And al the puple wondride, and seide, Whether this be the sone of Dauid?
But the Farisees herden, and seiden, He this casteth not out feendis, but in Belsabub, prince of feendis.
And Jhesus, witynge her thouytis, seide to hem, Eche kingdom departid ayens it silf, schal be desolatid, and eche cite, or hous, departid ayens it self, schal not stonde.
And if Satanas castith out Satanas, he is departid ayens him silf; therfor hou schal his kingdom stonde?
And if Y in Belsabub caste out deuelis, in `whom youre sones casten out? Therfor thei schulen be youre domes men.
But if Y in the Spirit of God caste out feendis, thanne the kyngdom of God is comen in to you.
Ethir hou may ony man entre in to the hous of a stronge man, and take awey hise vesselis, but `he first bynde the stronge man, and thanne he schal spuyle his hous?
He that is not with me, is ayens me; and he that gaderith not togidere with me, scaterith abrood.
Therfor I seie to you, al synne and blasfemye shal be foryouun to men, but `the spirit of blasfemye shal not be foryouun.
And who euere seith a word ayens mannus sone, it shal be foryouun to him; but who that seieth a word ayens the Hooli Goost, it shal not be foryouun to hym, nether in this world, ne in `the tothir.
Ethir make ye the tree good, and his fruyt good; ether make ye the tree yuel and his fruyt yuel; for a tree is knowun of the fruyt.
Ye generacioun of eddris, hou moun ye speke goode thingis, whanne ye ben yuele? For the mouth spekith of plente of the herte.
A good man bryngith forth good thingis of good tresoure, and an yuel man bringith forth yuel thingis of yuel tresoure.
And Y seie to you, that of euery idel word, that men speken, thei schulen yelde resoun therof in the dai of doom;
for of thi wordis thou schalt be iustified, and of thi wordis thou shalt be dampned.
Thanne summe of the scribis and Farisees answeriden to hym, and seiden, Mayster, we wolen se a tokne of thee.
Which answeride, and seide to hem, An yuel kynrede and a spouse brekere sekith a tokene, and a tokene shal not be youun to it, but the tokene of Jonas, the prophete.
For as Jonas was in the wombe of a whal thre daies and thre nyytis, so mannus sone shal be in the herte of the erthe thre daies and thre nyytis.
Men of Nynyue schulen rise in doom with this generacioun, and schulen condempne it; for thei diden penaunce in the prechyng of Jonas, and lo! here a gretter than Jonas.
The queene of the south shal rise in doom with this generacioun, and schal condempne it; for she cam fro the eendis of the erthe to here the wisdom of Salomon, and lo! here a gretter than Salomon.
Whanne an vnclene spirit goith out fro a man, he goith bi drie places, `and sekith rest, and fyndith not.
Thanne he seith, Y shal turne ayen in to myn hous, fro whannys Y wente out. And he cometh, and fyndith it voide, and clensid with besyms, and maad faire.
Thanne he goith, and takith with him seuene othere spiritis worse than hym silf; and thei entren, and dwellen there. And the laste thingis of that man ben maad worse than the formere. So it shal be to this worste generacioun.
Yit whil he spak to the puple, lo! his modir and his bretheren stoden withouteforth, sekynge to speke to hym.
And a man seide to hym, Lo! thi modir and thi britheren stonden withouteforth, sekynge thee.
He answeride to the man, that spak to hym, and seide, Who is my modir? and who ben my britheren?
And he helde forth his hoond in to hise disciplis, and seide, Lo! my modir and my bretheren;
for who euer doith the wille of my fadir that is in heuenes, he is my brothir, and sistir, and modir.

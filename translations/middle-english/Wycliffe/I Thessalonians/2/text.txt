For, britheren, ye witen oure entre to you, for it was not veyn;
but first we suffriden, and weren punyschid with wrongis, as ye witen in Filippis, and hadden trust in oure Lord, to speke to you the gospel of God in myche bisynesse.
And oure exortacioun is not of errour, nether of vnclennesse, nether in gile,
but as we ben preued of God, that the gospel of God schulde be takun to vs, so we speken; not as plesynge to men, but to God that preueth oure hertis.
For nether we weren ony tyme in word of glosing, as ye witen, nether in occasioun of auerise; God is witnesse; nether sekinge glorie of men,
nether of you,
nether of othere, whanne we, as Cristis apostlis, miyten haue be in charge to you. But we weren maad litle in the myddil of you, as if a nursche fostre hir sones;
so we desiringe you with greet loue, wolden haue bitake to you, not oneli the gospel of God, but also oure lyues, for ye ben maad most dereworthe to vs.
For, britheren, ye ben myndeful of oure trauel and werynesse; we worchiden nyyt and day, that we schulden not greue ony of you, and prechiden to you the euangelie of God.
God and ye ben witnessis, hou holili, and iustli, and with outen pleynt, we weren to you that bileueden.
As ye witen, hou we preyeden you, and coumfortiden ech of you, as the fadir hise sones,
and we han witnessid, that ye schulden go worthili to God, that clepide you in to his kingdom and glorie.
Therfor we doon thankingis to God with outen ceessyng. For whanne ye hadden take of vs the word `of the heryng of God, ye token it not as the word of men, but as `it is verili, the word of God, that worchith in you that han bileued.
For, britheren, ye ben maad foleweris of the chirchis of God, that ben in Jude, in Crist Jhesu, for ye han suffrid the same thingis of youre euene lynagis, as thei of the Jewis.
Whiche slowen bothe the Lord Jhesu and the profetis, and pursueden vs, and thei plesen not to God, and thei ben aduersaries to alle men;
forbedinge vs to speke to hethene men, that thei be maad saaf, that thei fille her synnes euere more; for the wraththe of God cam on hem in to the ende.
And, britheren, we desolat fro you for a tyme, bi mouth and in biholding, but not in herte, han hiyed more plenteuousli to se youre face with greet desir.
For we wolden come to you, yhe, Y Poul, onys and eftsoone, but Sathanas lettide vs.
For whi what is oure hope, or ioye, or coroun of glorie? Whether ye ben not bifore oure Lord Jhesu Crist in his comyng?
For ye ben oure glorie and ioye.

Therfor aftir that alle kyngis of Ammorreys herden, that dwelliden ouer Jordan at the west coost, and alle the kyngis of Canaan, that weldiden nyy places of the greet see, that the Lord hadden dried the flowyngis of Jordan bifor the sones of Israel, til thei passiden, the herte of hem was failid, and spirit dwellide not in hem, dredynge the entring of the sones of Israel.
In that tyme the Lord seide to Josue, Make to thee knyues of stoon, and circumside thou the sones of Israel, in the secunde tyme.
Josue dide tho thingis whiche the Lord comaundide, and he circumside the sones of Israel in the `hil of prepucies.
Sotheli this is the cause of the secunde circumcisioun; al the puple of male kynde, that yede out of Egipt, alle men fiyteris, weren deed in deseert bi the lengeste cumpassis of weie,
whiche alle weren circumsidid. Sotheli the puple
that was borun in deseert bi fourti yeer, in the weie of broddeste wildirnesse, was vncircumsidid til thei weren waastid, that herden not the `vois of the Lord, and to whiche he swoor bifore, that he schulde schewe to hem the lond flowynge with mylk and hony.
The sones of hem camen aftirward in to the place of fadris, and thei weren circumsidid of Josue; whiche, as thei weren borun, weren in prepucie, nether ony man hadde circumsidid hem in the weie.
Forsothe aftir that alle weren circumsidid, thei dwelliden in the same place of tentis, til thei weren heelid.
And the Lord seide to Josue, To dai Y haue take awei fro you the schenschip of Egipt. And the name of that place was clepid Galgala, `til in to present dai.
And the sones of Israel dwelliden in Galgalis, and maden pask in the fourtenthe dai of the monethe at euentide, in the feeldi places of Jerico;
and `thei eten of the fruytis of the lond `in the tothir day, therf looues, and potage of the same yeer, `ether cornys seengid and frotid in the hond.
And manna failide aftir that thei eten of the fruytis of the lond; and the sones of Israel vsiden no more that mete, but thei eten of the fruytis of present yeer of the lond of Canaan.
Sothely whanne Josue was in the feeld of the cite of Jerico, he reiside the iyen, and siy a man stondynge ayens hym, and holdynge a drawun swerd; and Josue yede out to hym, and seide, Art thou oure, ethir `of aduersaries?
To whom he answeride, Nay, but Y am prince of the `hoost of the Lord, and now Y come.
Josue felde lowe to erthe, and worschipide, and seide, What spekith my Lord to his seruaunt?
He seide, Vnlace thi schoo fro thi feet, for the place, in which thou stondist, is hooli. And Josue dide, as it was comaundid to hym.

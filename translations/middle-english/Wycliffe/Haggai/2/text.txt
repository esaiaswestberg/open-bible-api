In the foure and twentithe dai of the monethe, in the sixte monethe, in the secunde yeer of kyng Darius.
In the seuenthe monethe, in the oon and twentith dai of the monethe, the word of the Lord was maad in the hond of Aggei, the profete, and seide,
Speke thou to Sorobabel, the sone of Salatiel, the duyk of Juda, and to Jhesu, the gret preest, the sone of Josedech, and to othere of the puple, and seie thou,
Who in you is left, that sai this hous in his firste glorie? and what seen ye this now? whether it is not thus, as if it be not bifore youre iyen?
And now, Sorobabel, be thou coumfortid, seith the Lord, and Jhesu, greet preest, sone of Josedech, be thou coumfortid, and al the puple of the lond, be thou coumfortid, seith the Lord of oostis; and do ye, for Y am with you, seith the Lord of oostis.
The word that Y couenauntide with you, whanne ye wenten out of the lond of Egipt, and my Spirit schal be in the myddil of you.
Nyle ye drede, for the Lord of oostis seith these thingis, Yit o litil thing is, and Y schal moue heuene, and erthe, and see, and drie lond;
and Y schal moue alle folkis, and the desirid to alle folkis schal come; and Y schal fille this hous with glorie, seith the Lord of oostis.
Myn is siluer, and myn is gold, seith the Lord of oostes.
The glorie of this laste hous schal be greet, more than the firste, seith the Lord of oostis. And in this place Y schal yyue pees, seith the Lord of oostis.
In the foure and twentithe dai of the nynthe monethe, in the secounde yeer of kyng Daryus, the word of the Lord was maad to Aggei, the profete, and seide, The Lord God of oostis seith these thingis,
Axe thou preestis the lawe, and seie thou,
If a man takith halewyd fleisch in the hem of his clothing, and touchith of the hiynesse therof breed, ether potage, ether wyn, ether oile, ether ony mete, whether it schal be halewid? Sotheli preestis answeriden, and seiden, Nai.
And Aggei seide, If a man defoulid in soule touchith of alle these thingis, whether it schal be defoulid? And prestis answeriden, and seiden, It schal be defoulid.
And Aggei answeride, and seide, So is this puple, and so is this folc bifor my face, seith the Lord, and so is al werk of her hondis; and alle thingis whiche thei offren there, schulen be defoulid.
And nowe putte ye youre hertis, fro this dai and aboue, bifor that a stoon on a stoon was put in temple of the Lord,
whanne ye wenten to an heep of twenti buischels, and there weren maad ten; ye entriden to the pressour, that ye schulden presse out fifti galouns, and there weren maad twenti.
Y smoot you with brennynge wynd; and with myldew, and hail, alle the werkis of youre hondis; and ther was noon in you that turnede ayen to me, seith the Lord.
Putte ye youre hertis fro this dai, and in to comynge, fro the foure and twentithe dai of the nynthe monethe, fro the dai in whiche foundementis of the temple of the Lord ben castun, putte ye on youre herte.
Whether now seed is in buriownyng? and yit vineyerd, and fige tre, and pomgarnade, and the tre of olyue flouride not.
Fro this dai Y schal blesse. And the word of the Lord was maad the secounde tyme to Aggei, in the foure and twentithe dai of the monethe,
and seide, Spek thou to Sorobabel, duik of Juda, and seie thou, Y shal moue heuene and erthe togidere, and Y schal distrie the seet of rewmes,
and Y schal al to-breke the strengthe of rewme of hethene men, and schal distrie a foure horsid carte, and the stiere therof; and horsis schulen go doun, and stieris of hem, a man bi swerd of his brother.
In that dai, seith the Lord of oostis, thou Sorobabel, sone of Salatiel, my seruaunt, Y schal take thee, seith the Lord; and Y schal putte thee as a signet, for Y chees thee, seith the Lord of oostis.

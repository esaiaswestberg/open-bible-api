And Y was conuertid, and reiside myn iyen, and siy, and lo! a book fleynge.
And he seide to me, What seest thou? And Y seide, Lo! Y se a book fleynge; the lengthe therof was of twenti cubitis, and the breede therof of ten cubitis.
And he seide to me, This is the curs, that goith on the face of al erthe; for ech theef schal be demed, as it is writun there; and ech man swerynge, schal be demyd of this also.
Y schal lede out it, seith the Lord of oostis, and it schal come to the hous of a theef, and to the hous of hym that swerith falsli in my name; and it schal dwelle in myddil of hys hous, and schal waaste hym, and hise trees, and hise stoonys.
And the aungel wente out, that spak in me, and seide to me, Reyse thin iyen, and se, what this thing is, that goith out.
And Y seide, What is it? And he seide, This is a pot goyng out. And he seide, This is the iye of hem in al erthe.
And lo! a talent of leed was borun; and lo! a womman sittynge in myddil of the pot.
And he seide, This is vnpite, ether vnfeithfulnesse. And he castide doun hir in myddil of the pot, and sente a gobet of leed in to the mouth therof.
And Y reiside myn iyen, and siy, and lo! twei wymmen goynge out, and a spirit in wyngis of hem; and thei hadden wyngis as wyngis of a kite, and reisiden the pot bitwixe heuene and erthe.
And Y seide to the aungel that spak in me, Whidur beren these the pot?
And he seide to me, That an hous be bildid therto in the lond of Sennaar, and be stablischid, and set there on his foundement.

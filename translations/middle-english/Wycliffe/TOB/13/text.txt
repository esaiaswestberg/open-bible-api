Sones of Israel, knowleche ye to the Lord, and herye ye hym in the siyt of hethene men;
for herfor he scateride you among hethene men, that knowen not God, that ye telle out his merueils, and make hem to wite, that noon othere God is almyyti outakun hym.

Therfor, synneris, be ye conuertid, and do ye riytfulnesse bifor God, and bileue ye, that he schal do his merci with you.
Sotheli Y and my soule schulen be glad in hym.
Alle chosun of the Lord, blesse ye hym; make ye the daies of gladnesse, and knouleche ye to hym.
Jerusalem, the citee of God, the Lord hath chastisid thee for the werkis of thin hondis.
Knouleche thou to God in thi goodis, and blesse thou God of worldis, that he bilde ayen in thee his tabernacle, and ayen clepe to thee alle thi prisoneris; and that thou haue ioie in to alle worldis of worldis.

for thei schulen `clepe in thee the grete name.
And thei schulen be cursid, that dispisen thee, and thei schulen be dampned, that blasfemen thee; and thei schulen be blessid, that bilden thee.
Forsothe thou schalt be glad in thi sones, for alle schulen be blessid, and schulen be gaderid togidere to the Lord.
Blessid ben alle that louen thee, and that han ioie on thi pees.
My soule, blesse thou the Lord, for `oure Lord God hath delyuered Jerusalem, his citee, fro alle tribulaciouns therof.

The yatis of Jerusalem schulen be bildid of saphire and smaragde, and of preciouse stoon; al the cumpas of wallis therof schal be of white and clene stoon.
Alle the stretis therof schulen be strewid; and alleluya, `that is, the heriyng of God, schal be sungun bi the stretis therof.
Blessid be the Lord, that enhaunside it, that his rewme be on it in to worldis of worldis. Amen.

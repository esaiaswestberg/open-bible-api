As the morewtid passith, the king of Israel schal passe forth. For Israel was a child, and Y louyde hym; and fro Egipt Y clepide my sone.
Thei clepiden hem, so thei yeden awei fro the face of hem. Thei offriden to Baalym, and maden sacrifice to symylacris.
And Y as a nursche of Effraym bare hem in myn armes, and thei wisten not, that Y kepte hem.
Y schal drawe hem in the ropis of Adam, in the boondis of charite. And Y schal be to hem as he that enhaunsith the yok on the chekis of hem; and Y bowide doun to hym, that he schulde ete.
He schal not turne ayen in to the lond of Egipt. And Assur, he schal be kyng of hym, for thei nolden turne.
A swerd bigan in the citees therof, and it schal waaste the chosun men therof, and schal eete the heedis of hem.
And my puple schal hange, at my comynge ayen. But a yok schal be put to hem togidere, that schal not be takun awei.
Hou schal Y yyue thee, Effraym? schal Y defende thee, Israel? hou schal Y yyue thee? As Adama Y schal sette thee; as Seboym. Myn herte is turned in me; my repentaunce is disturblid togidere.
Y schal not do the strong veniaunce of my wraththe. Y schal not turne, to leese Effraym; for Y am God, and not man. Y am hooli in the myddis of thee, and Y schal not entre in to a citee.
Thei schulen go after the Lord. He shal rore as a lioun, for he shal rore, and the sones of the see schulen drede.
And thei schulen fle awei as a brid fro Egipt, and as a culuer fro the lond of Assiriens. And Y schal sette hem in her housis, seith the Lord.
Effraym cumpasside me in denying, the hous of Israel in gile. But Judas a witnesse yede doun with God, and with feithful seyntis.

The `title of the hundrid and nyne and fourtithe salm. Alleluya. Synge ye to the Lord a newe song; hise heriyng be in the chirche of seyntis.
Israel be glad in hym that made hym; and the douytris of Syon make ful out ioye in her king.
Herie thei his name in a queer; seie thei salm to hym in a tympan, and sautre.
For the Lord is wel plesid in his puple; and he hath reisid mylde men in to heelthe.
Seyntis schulen make ful out ioye in glorie; thei schulen be glad in her beddis.
The ful out ioiyngis of God in the throte of hem; and swerdis scharp on `ech side in the hondis of hem.
To do veniaunce in naciouns; blamyngis in puplis.
To bynde the kyngis of hem in stockis; and the noble men of hem in yrun manaclis.
That thei make in hem doom writun; this is glorye to alle hise seyntis.

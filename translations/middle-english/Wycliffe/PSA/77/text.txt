The `title of the seuene and seuentithe salm. The lernyng of Asaph. Mi puple, perseyue ye my lawe; bowe youre eere in to the wordis of my mouth.
I schal opene my mouth in parablis; Y schal speke perfite resouns fro the bigynnyng.
Hou grete thingis han we herd, aud we han knowe tho; and oure fadris. telden to vs.
Tho ben not hid fro the sones of hem; in anothir generacioun. And thei telden the heriyngis of the Lord, and the vertues of hym; and hise merueilis, whyche he dide.
And he reiside witnessyng in Jacob; and he settide lawe in Israel. Hou grete thingis comaundide he to oure fadris, to make tho knowun to her sones;
that another generacioun knowe. Sones, that schulen be born, and schulen rise vp; schulen telle out to her sones.
That thei sette her hope in God, and foryete not the werkis of God; and that thei seke hise comaundementis.
Lest thei be maad a schrewid generacioun; and terrynge to wraththe, as the fadris of hem. A generacioun that dresside not his herte; and his spirit was not bileued with God.
The sones of Effraym, bendinge a bouwe and sendynge arowis; weren turned in the dai of batel.
Thei kepten not the testament of God; and thei nolden go in his lawe.
And thei foryaten hise benefices; and hise merueils, whiche he schewide to hem.
He dide merueils bifore the fadris of hem in the loond of Egipt; in the feeld of Taphneos.
He brak the see, and ledde hem thorou; and he ordeynede the watris as in a bouge.
And he ledde hem forth in a cloude of the dai; and al niyt in the liytnyng of fier.
He brak a stoon in deseert; and he yaf watir to hem as in a myche depthe.
And he ledde watir out of the stoon; and he ledde forth watris as floodis.
And thei `leiden to yit to do synne ayens hym; thei excitiden hiye God in to ire, in a place with out water.
And thei temptiden God in her hertis; that thei axiden meetis to her lyues.
And thei spaken yuel of God; thei seiden, Whether God may make redi a bord in desert?
For he smoot a stoon, and watris flowiden; and streemys yeden out in aboundaunce. Whether also he may yyue breed; ether make redi a bord to his puple?
Therfor the Lord herde, and delaiede; and fier was kindelid in Jacob, and the ire of God stiede on Israel.
For thei bileueden not in God; nether hopiden in his heelthe.
And he comaundide to the cloudis aboue; and he openyde the yatis of heuene.
And he reynede to hem manna for to eete; and he yaf to hem breed of heuene.
Man eet the breed of aungels; he sent to hem meetis in aboundance.
He turnede ouere the south wynde fro heuene; and he brouyte in bi his vertu the weste wynde.
And he reynede fleischis as dust on hem; and `he reinede volatils fethered, as the grauel of the see.
And tho felden doun in the myddis of her castels; aboute the tabernaclis of hem.
And thei eeten, and weren fillid greetli, and he brouyte her desire to hem;
thei weren not defraudid of her desier. Yit her metis weren in her mouth;
and the ire of God stiede on hem. And he killide the fatte men of hem; and he lettide the chosene men of Israel.
In alle these thingis thei synneden yit; and bileuede not in the merueils of God.
And the daies of hem failiden in vanytee; and the yeeris of hem faileden with haste.
Whanne he killide hem, thei souyten hym; and turneden ayen, and eerli thei camen to hym.
And thei bithouyten, that God is the helper of hem; and `the hiy God is the ayenbier of hem.
And thei loueden hym in her mouth; and with her tunge thei lieden to hym.
Forsothe the herte of hem was not riytful with hym; nethir thei weren had feithful in his testament.
But he is merciful, and he schal be maad merciful to the synnes of hem; and he schal not destrie hem. And he dide greetli, to turne awei his yre; and he kyndelide not al his ire.
And he bithouyte, that thei ben fleische; a spirit goynge, and not turnynge ayen.
Hou oft maden thei hym wrooth in desert; thei stireden hym in to ire in a place with out watir.
And thei weren turned, and temptiden God; and thei wraththiden the hooli of Israel.
Thei bithouyten not on his hond; in the dai in the which he ayen bouyte hem fro the hond of the trobler.
As he settide hise signes in Egipt; and hise grete wondris in the feeld of Taphneos.
And he turnede the flodis of hem and the reynes of hem in to blood; that thei schulden not drynke.
He sente a fleisch flie in to hem, and it eet hem; and he sente a paddok, and it loste hem.
And he yaf the fruytis of hem to rust; and he yaf the trauels of hem to locustis.
And he killide the vynes of hem bi hail; and the moore trees of hem bi a frost.
And he bitook the beestis of hem to hail; and the possessioun of hem to fier.
He sente in to hem the ire of his indignacioun; indignacioun, and ire, and tribulacioun, sendingis in bi iuel aungels.
He made weie to the path of his ire, and he sparide not fro the deth of her lyues; and he closide togidere in deth the beestis of hem.
And he smoot al the first gendrid thing in the lond of Egipt; the first fruytis of alle the trauel of hem in the tabernaclis of Cham.
And he took awei his puple as scheep; and he ledde hem forth as a flok in desert.
And he ledde hem forth in hope, and thei dredden not; and the see hilide the enemyes of hem.
And he brouyte hem in to the hil of his halewyng; in to the hil which his riythond gat. And he castide out hethene men fro the face of hem; and bi lot he departide to hem the lond in a cord of delyng.
And he made the lynagis of Israel to dwelle in the tabernaclis of hem.
And thei temptiden, and wraththiden heiy God; and thei kepten not hise witnessyngis.
And thei turneden awei hem silf, and thei kepten not couenaunt; as her fadris weren turned in to a schrewid bouwe.
Thei stiriden him in to ire in her litle hillis; and thei terriden hym to indignacioun of her grauen ymagis.
God herde, and forsook; and brouyte to nouyt Israel greetli.
And he puttide awei the tabernacle of Sylo; his tabernacle where he dwellide among men.
And he bitook the vertu of hem in to caitiftee; and the fairnesse of hem in to the hondis of the enemye.
And he closide togidere his puple in swerd; and he dispiside his erytage.
Fier eet the yonge men of hem; and the virgyns of hem weren not biweilid.
The prestis of hem fellen doun bi swerd; and the widewis of hem weren not biwept.
And the Lord was reisid, as slepynge; as miyti greetli fillid of wiyn.
And he smoot hise enemyes on the hynderere partis; he yaf to hem euerlastyng schenschipe.
And he puttide awei the tabernacle of Joseph; and he chees not the lynage of Effraym.
But he chees the lynage of Juda; he chees the hil of Syon, which he louede.
And he as an vnicorn bildide his hooli place; in the lond, which he foundide in to worldis.
And he chees Dauid his seruaunt, and took hym vp fro the flockis of scheep; he took hym fro bihynde scheep with lambren.
To feed Jacob his seruaunt; and Israel his eritage.
And he fedde hem in the innocens of his herte; and he ledde hem forth in the vndurstondyngis of his hondis.

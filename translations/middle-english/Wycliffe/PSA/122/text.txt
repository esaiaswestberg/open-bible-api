The `title of the hundrid and two and twentithe salm. `The song of grecis. To thee Y haue reisid myn iyen; that dwellist in heuenes.
Lo! as the iyen of seruauntis; ben in the hondis of her lordis. As the iyen of the handmaide ben in the hondis of her ladi; so oure iyen ben to oure Lord God, til he haue mercy on vs.
Lord, haue thou merci on vs, haue thou merci on vs; for we ben myche fillid with dispisyng.
For oure soule is myche fillid; we ben schenschipe to hem that ben abundaunte with richessis, and dispising to proude men.

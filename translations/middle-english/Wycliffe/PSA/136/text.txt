The hundrid and sixe and thrittithe salm. On the floodis of Babiloyne there we saten, and wepten; while we bithouyten on Syon.
In salewis in the myddil therof; we hangiden vp oure orguns.
For thei that ledden vs prisoners; axiden vs there the wordis of songis. And thei that ledden awei vs seiden; Synge ye to vs an ympne of the songis of Syon.
Hou schulen we singe a songe of the Lord; in an alien lond?
If Y foryete thee, Jerusalem; my riyt hond be youun to foryeting.
Mi tunge cleue to my chekis; if Y bithenke not on thee. If Y purposide not of thee, Jerusalem; in the bigynnyng of my gladnesse.
Lord, haue thou mynde on the sones of Edom; for the dai of Jerusalem. Whiche seien, Anyntische ye, anyntische ye; `til to the foundement ther ynne.
Thou wretchid douyter of Babiloyne; he is blessid, that `schal yelde to thee thi yelding, which thou yeldidist to vs.
He is blessid, that schal holde; and hurtle doun hise litle children at a stoon.

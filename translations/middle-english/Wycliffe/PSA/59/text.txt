To the ouercomer for lilies, the witnessing of meke and parfit Dauid, to teche, whanne he fauyte ayens Sirie of Mesopotamye, and Soba, and so forth.
God, thou hast put awei vs, and thou hast distried vs; thou were wrooth, and thou hast do merci to vs.
Thou mouedist the erthe, and thou disturblidist it; make thou hool the sorewis therof, for it is moued.
Thou schewidist harde thingis to thi puple; thou yauest drynk to vs with the wyn of compunccioun.
Thou hast youe a signefiyng to hem that dreden thee; that thei fle fro the face of the bouwe. That thi derlyngis be delyuered;
make thou saaf with thi riyt hond `the puple of Israel, and here thou me.
God spak bi his hooli; Y schal be glad, and Y schal departe Siccimam, and Y schal meete the greet valei of tabernaclis.
Galaad is myn, and Manasses is myn; and Effraym is the strengthe of myn heed.
Juda is my king; Moab is the pot of myn hope. In to Idumee Y schal stretche forth my scho; aliens ben maad suget to me.
Who schal lede me in to a citee maad strong; who schal leede me til in to Ydumee?
Whether not thou, God, that hast put awei vs; and schalt thou not, God, go out in oure vertues?
Lord, yyue thou to vs help of tribulacioun; for the heelthe of man is veyn.
In God we schulen make vertu; and he schal bringe to nouyt hem that disturblen vs.

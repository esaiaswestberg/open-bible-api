The foure and nyntithe salm. Come ye, make we ful out ioie to the Lord; hertli synge we to God, oure heelthe.
Bifore ocupie we his face in knowleching; and hertli synge we to him in salmes.
For God is a greet Lord, and a greet king aboue alle goddis; for the Lord schal not putte awei his puple.
For alle the endis of erthe ben in his hond; and the hiynesses of hillis ben hise.
For the see is his, and he made it; and hise hondis formeden the drie lond.
Come ye, herie we, and falle we doun bifore God, wepe we bifore the Lord that made vs;
for he is oure Lord God. And we ben the puple of his lesewe; and the scheep of his hond.
If ye han herd his vois to dai; nyle ye make hard youre hertis.
As in the terryng to wraththe; bi the dai of temptacioun in desert. Where youre fadris temptiden me; thei preueden and sien my werkis.
Fourti yeer I was offendid to this generacioun; and Y seide, Euere thei erren in herte.
And these men knewen not my weies; to whiche Y swoor in myn ire, thei schulen not entre in to my reste.

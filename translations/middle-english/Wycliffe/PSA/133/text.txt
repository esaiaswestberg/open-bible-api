The `title of the hundrid and thre and thrittithe salm. The song of greces. Lo! now blesse ye the Lord; alle the seruauntis of the Lord. Ye that stonden in the hous of the Lord; in the hallis of `the hous of oure God.
In nyytis reise youre hondis in to hooli thingis; and blesse ye the Lord.
The Lord blesse thee fro Syon; which Lord made heuene and erthe.

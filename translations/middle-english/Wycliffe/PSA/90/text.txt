`The nyntithe salm. He that dwellith in the help of the hiyeste God; schal dwelle in the proteccioun of God of heuene.
He schal seie to the Lord, Thou art myn vptaker, and my refuit; my God, Y schal hope in him.
For he delyuered me fro the snare of hunteris; and fro a scharp word.
With hise schuldris he schal make schadowe to thee; and thou schalt haue hope vnder hise fetheris.
His treuthe schal cumpasse thee with a scheld; thou schalt not drede of nyytis drede.
Of an arowe fliynge in the dai, of a gobelyn goynge in derknessis; of asailing, and a myddai feend.
A thousynde schulen falle doun fro thi side, and ten thousynde fro thi riytside; forsothe it schal not neiye to thee.
Netheles thou schalt biholde with thin iyen; and thou schalt se the yelding of synneris.
For thou, Lord, art myn hope; thou hast set thin help altherhiyeste.
Yuel schal not come to thee; and a scourge schal not neiye to thi tabernacle.
For God hath comaundid to hise aungels of thee; that thei kepe thee in alle thi weies.
Thei schulen beere thee in the hondis; leste perauenture thou hirte thi foot at a stoon.
Thou schalt go on a snake, and a cocatrice; and thou schalt defoule a lioun and a dragoun.
For he hopide in me, Y schal delyuere hym; Y schal defende him, for he knew my name.
He criede to me, and Y schal here him, Y am with him in tribulacioun; Y schal delyuere him, and Y schal glorifie hym.
I schal fille hym with the lengthe of daies; and Y schal schewe myn helthe to him.

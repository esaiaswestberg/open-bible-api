The `title of the hundrid and fyue and twentithe `salm. The song of grecis. Whanne the Lord turnede the caitifte of Sion; we weren maad as coumfortid.
Thanne oure mouth was fillid with ioye; and oure tunge with ful out ioiyng. Thanne thei schulen seie among hethene men; The Lord magnefiede to do with hem.
The Lord magnefiede to do with vs; we ben maad glad.
Lord, turne thou oure caitifte; as a stronde in the south.
Thei that sowen in teeris; schulen repe in ful out ioiyng.
Thei goynge yeden, and wepten; sendynge her seedis. But thei comynge schulen come with ful out ioiyng; berynge her handfullis.

The title of the oon and fourtithe salm. To victorie, to the sones of Chore.
As an hert desirith to the wellis of watris; so thou, God, my soule desirith to thee.
Mi soule thirstide to God, `that is a `quik welle; whanne schal Y come, and appere bifor the face of God?
Mi teeris weren looues to me bi dai and nyyt; while it is seid to me ech dai, Where is thi God?
I bithouyte of these thingis, and Y schedde out in me my soule; for Y schal passe in to the place of the wondurful tabernacle, til to the hows of God. In the vois of ful out ioiyng and knoulechyng; is the sown of the etere.
Mi soule, whi art thou sory; and whi disturblist thou me? Hope thou in God, for yit Y schal knouleche to hym; he is the helthe of my cheer,
and my God. My soule is disturblid at my silf; therfor, God, Y schal be myndeful of thee fro the lond of Jordan, and fro the litil hil Hermonyim.
Depthe clepith depthe; in the vois of thi wyndows. Alle thin hiye thingis and thi wawis; passiden ouer me.

Mi soule, whi art thou sori; and whi disturblist thou me? Hope thou in God, for yit Y schal knouleche to hym; `he is the helthe of my cheer, and my God.

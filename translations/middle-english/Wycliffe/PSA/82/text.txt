The title of the two and eiytetithe salm. The song of the salm of Asaph.
God, who schal be lijk thee? God, be thou not stille, nether be thou peesid.
For lo! thin enemyes sowneden; and thei that haten thee reisiden the heed.
Thei maden a wickid counsel on thi puple; and thei thouyten ayens thi seyntis.
Thei seiden, Come ye, and leese we hem fro the folk; and the name of Israel be no more hadde in mynde.
For thei thouyten with oon acord;
the tabernaclis of Ydumeys, and men of Ismael disposiden a testament togidere ayens thee. Moab, and Agarenus, Jebal, and Amon, and Amalech;
alienys with hem that dwellen in Tyre.
For Assur cometh with hem; thei ben maad in to help to the sones of Loth.
Make thou to hem as to Madian, and Sisara; as to Jabyn in the stronde of Sison.
Thei perischiden in Endor; thei weren maad as a toord of erthe.
Putte thou the prynces of hem as Oreb and Zeb; and Zebee and Salmana. Alle the princis of hem, that seiden;
Holde we bi eritage the seyntuarie of God.
My God, putte thou hem as a whele; and as stobil bifor the face of the wynde.
As fier that brenneth a wode; and as flawme brynnynge hillis.
So thou schalt pursue hem in thi tempeste; and thou schalt disturble hem in thin ire.
Lord, fille thou the faces of hem with schenschipe; and thei schulen seke thi name.
Be thei aschamed, and be thei disturblid in to world of world; and be thei schent and perische thei.
And knowe thei, that the Lord is name to thee; thou aloone art the hiyeste in ech lond.

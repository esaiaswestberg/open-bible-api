The title of the nyne and eiytetithe salm. The preier of Moises, the man of God. Lord, thou art maad help to vs; fro generacioun in to generacioun.
Bifore that hillis weren maad, ether the erthe and the world was formed; fro the world and in to the world thou art God.
Turne thou not awei a man in to lownesse; and thou seidist, Ye sones of men, be conuertid.
For a thousynde yeer ben bifore thin iyen; as yistirdai, which is passid, and as keping in the niyt.
The yeeris of hem schulen be; that ben had for nouyt.
Eerli passe he, as an eerbe, eerli florische he, and passe; in the euentid falle he doun, be he hard, and wexe drie.
For we han failid in thin ire; and we ben disturblid in thi strong veniaunce.
Thou hast set oure wickidnessis in thi siyt; oure world in the liytning of thi cheer.
For alle oure daies han failid; and we han failid in thin ire. Oure yeris schulen bithenke, as an yreyn;
the daies of oure yeeris ben in tho seuenti yeeris. Forsothe, if fourescoor yeer ben in myyti men; and the more tyme of hem is trauel and sorewe. For myldenesse cam aboue; and we schulen be chastisid.
Who knew the power of thin ire; and durste noumbre thin ire for thi drede?
Make thi riythond so knowun; and make men lerned in herte bi wisdom.
Lord, be thou conuertid sumdeel; and be thou able to be preied on thi seruauntis.
We weren fillid eerli with thi merci; we maden ful out ioye, and we delitiden in alle oure daies.
We weren glad for the daies in whiche thou madist vs meke; for the yeeris in whiche we siyen yuels.
Lord, biholde thou into thi seruauntis, and in to thi werkis; and dresse thou the sones of hem.
And the schynyng of oure Lord God be on vs; and dresse thou the werkis of oure hondis on vs, and dresse thou the werk of oure hondis.

And whanne Jhesus cam nyy to Jerusalem and to Betanye, to the mount of Olyues, he sendith tweyne of hise disciplis, and seith to hem,
Go ye in to the castel that is ayens you; and anoon as ye entren there ye schulen fynde a colt tied, on which no man hath sete yit; vntie ye, and brynge hym.
And if ony man seye ony thing to you, What doen ye? seie ye, that he is nedeful to the Lord, and anoon he schal leeue hym hidir.
And thei yeden forth, and founden a colt tied bifor the yate with out forth, in the metyng of twei weies; and thei vntieden hym.
And summe of hem that stoden there seiden to hem, What doen ye, vntiynge the colt?
And thei seiden to hem, as Jhesus comaundide hem; and thei leften it to hem.
And thei brouyten the colt to Jhesu, and thei leiden on hym her clothis, and Jhesus sat on hym.
And many strewiden her clothis in the weie, othere men kittiden braunchis fro trees, and strewiden in the weie.
And thei that wenten bifor, and that sueden, crieden, and seiden, Osanna,
blissid is he that cometh in the name of the Lord; blessid be the kyngdom of oure fadir Dauid that is come; Osanna in hiyest thingis.
And he entride in to Jerusalem, in to the temple; and whanne he `hadde seyn al thing aboute, whanne it was eue, he wente out in to Betanye, with the twelue.
And anothir daye, whanne he wente out of Betanye, he hungride.
And whanne he hadde seyn a fige tree afer hauynge leeues, he cam, if happili he schulde fynde ony thing theron; and whanne he cam to it, he foonde no thing, out takun leeues; for it was not tyme of figis.
And Jhesus answeride and seide to it, Now neuer ete ony man fruyt of thee more. And hise disciplis herden;
and thei camen to Jerusalem. And whanne he was entrid in to the temple, he bigan to caste out silleris and biggeris in the temple; and he turnede vpsodoun the bordis of chaungeris, and the chayeris of men that selden culueris;
and he suffride not, that ony man schulde bere a vessel thorou the temple.
And he tauyte hem, and seide, Whether it is not writun, That myn hous schal be clepid the hous of preyng to alle folkis? but ye han maad it a denne of theues.
And whanne this thing was herd, the princis of prestis and scribis souyten hou thei schulden leese hym; for thei dredden hym, for al the puple wondride on his techyng.
And whanne euenyng was come, he wente out of the citee.
And as thei passiden forth eerli, thei sayn the fige tree maad drye fro the rootis.
And Petir bithouyte hym, and seide to hym, Maister, lo! the fige tree, whom thou cursidist, is dried vp.
And Jhesus answeride and seide to hem, Haue ye the feith of God;
treuli Y seie to you, that who euer seith to this hil, Be thou takun, and cast in to the see; and doute not in his herte, but bileueth, that what euer he seie, schal be don, it schal be don to hym.
Therfor Y seie to you, alle thingis what euer thingis ye preynge schulen axe, bileue ye that ye schulen take, and thei schulen come to you.
And whanne ye schulen stonde to preye, foryyue ye, if ye han ony thing ayens ony man, that youre fadir that is in heuenes, foryyue to you youre synnes.
And if ye foryyuen not, nether youre fadir that is in heuenes, schal foryyue to you youre synnes.
And eftsoone thei camen to Jerusalem. And whanne he walkide in the temple, the hiyeste prestis, and scribis, and the elder men camen to hym,
and seyn to hym, In what power doist thou these thingis? or who yaf to thee this power, that thou do these thingis?
Jhesus answeride and seide to hem, And Y schal axe you o word, and answere ye to me, and Y schal seie to you in what power Y do these thingis.
Whether was the baptym of Joon of heuene, or of men? answere ye to me.
And thei thouyten with ynne hem silf, seiynge, If we seien of heuene, he schal seie to vs, Whi thanne bileuen ye not to him;
if we seien of men, we dreden the puple; for alle men hadden Joon, that he was verili a prophete.
And thei answeryden, and seien to Jhesu, We witen neuer. And Jhesu answerde, and seide to hem, Nether Y seie to you, in what power Y do these thingis.

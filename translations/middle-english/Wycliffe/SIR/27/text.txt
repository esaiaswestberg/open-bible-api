Many men han trespassid for nedynesse; and he that sekith to be maad riche, turneth a wei his iye.
As a stake is fastned in the myddis of a heep of stoonys, so and a man schal be angwischid bi synnes bitwixe the middis of sillyng and biyng.

A furneis preueth the vessels of a pottere; and the temptacioun of tribulacioun preueth iust men.
As cherliche trauel aboute a tree schewith the fruyt therof, so a word of thouyt schewith the herte of man.
Preise thou not a man bifore a word; for whi this is the temptacioun of men.
If thou suest riytfulnesse, thou schalt take it; thou schalt clothe it as a long cloth of onour, and thou schalt dwelle with it, and it schal defende thee with outen ende, and in the dai of knowing thou shalt fynde stidfastnesse.

Therfor Jhesus bifor sixe daies of pask cam to Bethanye, where Lazarus hadde be deed, whom Jhesus reiside.
And thei maden to hym a soopere there, and Martha mynystride to hym; and Lazarus was oon of men that saten at the mete with hym.
Therfor Marie took a pound of oynement of trewe narde precious, and anoyntide the feet of Jhesu, and wipte hise feet with hir heeris; and the hous was fulfillid of the sauour of the oynement.
Therfor Judas Scarioth, oon of hise disciplis, that was to bitraye hym,
seide, Whi is not this oynement seeld for thre hundrid pens, and is youun to nedi men?
But he seide this thing, not for it perteynede to hym of nedi men, but for he was a theef, and he hadde the pursis, and bar tho thingis that weren sent.
Therfor Jhesus seide, Suffre ye hir, that in to the day of my biriyng sche kepe that;
for ye schulen euermore haue pore men with you, but ye schulen not euermore haue me.
Therfore myche puple of Jewis knew, that Jhesus was there; and thei camen, not oonli for Jhesu, but to se Lazarus, whom he hadde reisid fro deth.
But the princis of prestis thouyten to sle Lazarus,
for manye of the Jewis wenten awei for him, and bileueden in Jhesu.
But on the morew a myche puple, that cam togidere to the feeste dai, whanne thei hadden herd, that Jhesus cam to Jerusalem,
token braunchis of palmes, and camen forth ayens hym, and crieden, Osanna, blessid is the kyng of Israel, that cometh in the name of the Lord.
And Jhesus foond a yonge asse, and sat on hym,
as it is writun, The douytir of Syon, nyle thou drede; lo! thi kyng cometh, sittynge on `an asse fole.
Hise disciplis knewen not first these thingis, but whanne Jhesus was glorified, thanne thei hadden mynde, for these thingis weren writun of hym, and these thingis thei diden to hym.
Therfor the puple bar witnessyng, that was with hym, whanne he clepide Lazarus fro the graue, and reiside hym fro deth.
And therfor the puple cam, and mette with hym, for thei herden that he hadde don this signe.
Therfor the Farisees seiden to hem silf, Ye seen, that we profiten no thing; lo! al the world wente aftir hym.
And there weren summe hethene men, of hem that hadden come vp to worschipe in the feeste dai.
And these camen to Filip, that was of Bethsaida of Galilee, and preieden hym, and seiden, Sire, we wolen se Jhesu.
Filip cometh, and seith to Andrew; eft Andrew and Filip seiden to Jhesu.
And Jhesus answerde `to hem, and seide, The our cometh, that mannus sone be clarified.
Treuli, treuli, Y seie to you, but a corn of whete falle in to the erthe, and be deed, it dwellith aloone;
but if it be deed, it bryngith myche fruyt. He that loueth his lijf, schal leese it; and he that hatith his lijf in this world, kepith it in to euerlastynge lijf.
If ony man serue me, sue he me; and where Y am, there my mynystre schal be. If ony man serue me, my fadir schal worschipe hym.
Now my soule is troublid, and what schal Y seie? Fadir, saue me fro this our; but therfor Y cam in to this our;
fadir, clarifie thi name. And a vois cam fro heuene, and seide, And Y haue clarified, and eft Y schal clarifie.
Therfor the puple that stood, and herde, seide, that `thundur was maad; othere men seide, an aungel spak to hym.
Jhesus answerde, and seide, This vois cam not for me, but for you.
Now is the doom of the world, now the prince of this world schal be cast out.
And if Y schal be enhaunsid fro the erthe, Y schal drawe alle thingis to my silf.
And he seide this thing, signifiynge bi what deth he `was to die.
And the puple answeride to hym, We han herd of the lawe, that Crist dwellith with outen ende; and hou seist thou, It bihoueth mannys sone to be arerid?
Who is this mannus sone? And thanne Jhesus seith to hem, Yit a litil liyt is in you; walke ye, the while ye han liyt, that derknessis catche you not; he that wandrith in derknessis, woot nere whidur he goith.
While ye han liyt, bileue ye in liyt, that ye be the children of liyt. Jhesus spak these thingis, and wente, and hidde hym fro hem.
And whanne he hadde don so many myraclis bifor hem, thei bileueden not `in to hym;
that the word of Ysaie, the prophete, schulde be fulfillid, which he seide, Lord, who bileuede to oure heryng, and to whom is the arm of the Lord schewid?
Therfor thei myyten not bileue, for eft Ysaye seide,
He hath blyndid her iyen, and he hath maad hard the herte of hem, that thei se not with iyen, and vndurstonde with herte; and that thei be conuertid, and Y heele hem.
Ysaye seide these thingis, whanne he say the glorie of hym, and spak of hym.
Netheles `of the pryncis manye bileueden in hym, but for the Farisees thei knowlechiden not, that thei schulden not be put out of the synagoge;
for thei loueden the glorie of men, more than the glorie of God.
And Jhesus criede, and seide, He that bileueth in me, bileueth not in me, but in hym that sente me.
He that seeth me, seeth hym that sente me.
Y liyt cam in to the world, that ech that bileueth in me, dwelle not in derknessis.
And if ony man herith my words, and kepith hem, Y deme hym not; for Y cam not, that Y deme the world, but that Y make the world saaf.
He that dispisith me, and takith not my wordis, hath hym that schal iuge hym; thilke word that Y haue spokun, schal deme hym in the last dai.
For Y haue not spokun of my silf, but thilke fadir that sente me, yaf to me a maundement, what Y schal seie, and what Y schal speke.
And Y woot, that his maundement is euerlastynge lijf; therfor tho thingis that Y speke, as the fadir seide to me, so Y speke.

And Iram, the kyng of Tyre, sente messageris to Dauid, and `he sente trees of cedre, and werk men of wallis and of trees, that thei schulden bilde to hym an hows.
And Dauid knewe that the Lord hadde confermyd hym in to kyng on Israel; and that his rewme was reisid on his puple Israel.
And Dauid took othere wyues in Jerusalem, and gendride sones and douytris.
And these ben the names of hem that weren borun to hym in Jerusalem; Sammu, and Sobab, Nathan, and Salomon,

Forsothe the Filisteis herden that Dauid was anoyntid `in to kyng on al Israel, and alle stieden to seke Dauid. And whanne Dauid hadde herd this thing, he yede out ayens hem.
Forsothe Filisteis camen, and weren spred abrood in the valey of Raphaym;
and Dauid counselide the Lord, and seide, Whether Y schal stie to Filisteis? and whether thou schalt bitake hem in to myn hondis? And the Lord seide to hym, Stie thou, and Y schal bitake hem in thin hond.
And whanne thei hadden styed in to Baal Pharasym, Dauid smoot hem there, and seide, God hath departid myn enemyes bi myn hond, as watris ben departid. And therfor the name of that place was clepid Baal Pharasym; and thei leften there her goddis,

And whanne thou schalt here the sowun of a goere in the cop of the pere trees, thanne thou schalt go out to batel; for the Lord is go out byfor thee, to smyte the castels of Filisteis.

And the name of Dauid was puplischid in alle cuntreis, and the Lord yaf his drede on alle folkis.

And the Lord spak to Moises, and seide, Comaunde thou to the sones of Israel,
that thei caste out of the castels ech leprouse man, and that fletith out seed, and is defoulid on a deed bodi; caste ye out of the castels,
as wel a male as a female, lest thei defoulen tho, whanne thei dwellen with you.
And the sones of Israel diden so; and thei castiden hem out of the castels, as the Lord spak to Moises.
And the Lord spak to Moises,
and seide, Speke thou to the sones of Israel, Whanne a man ethir a womman han do of alle synnes that ben wont to falle to men, and han broke bi necgligence the `comaundement of the Lord,
and han trespassid, thei schulen knowleche her synne, and thei schulen yelde thilke heed, and the fyuethe part aboue, to hym ayens whom thei synneden.
But if noon is that schal resseyue thei schulen yyue to the Lord, and it schal be the preestis part, outakun the ram which is offrid for clensyng, that it be a quemeful sacrifice.
Also alle the firste fruytis, whiche the sones of Israel offren, perteynen to the preest;
and what euer thing  is offrid of ech man in the seyntuarie, and is youun to the `hondis of the preest  , it schal be the preestis part.
And the Lord spak to Moises,
and seide, Speke thou to the sones of Israel, and thou schalt seie to hem, If `the wijf of a man hath errid, and hath dispisid the hosebonde,
and hath slept with another man, and the hosebonde may not take ether preue this, but the auowtrye is hid, and may not be preuyd bi witnessis, for sche is not foundun in leccherie;
if the spirit of gelousie stirith the housebonde ayens his wijf, which is ether defoulid, ethir is apechid bi fals suspecioun,
the man schal brynge hir to the preest, and he schal offre an offryng for hir `the tenthe part of a mesure clepid satum of barli meele; he schal not schede oyle ther onne, nethir he schal putte encense, for it is the sacrifice of gelousie, and an offryng enquerynge auowtrye.
Therfor the preest schal offre hir, and schal sette bifore the Lord;
and he schal take holi watir in `a vessel of erthe, and he schal putte in to it a litil of the erthe of the pawment of the tabernacle.
And whanne the womman stondith in the siyt of the Lord, he schal diskyuere hir heed, and he schal putte `on the hondis of hir the sacrifice of remembryng, and the offryng of gelousie. Sotheli he schal holde moost bittir watris, in whiche he gaderide togidere cursis with cursyng.
And he schal conioure hir, and schal seie, If an alien man slepte not with thee, and if thou art not defoulid in the forsakyng the bed of the hosebonde, these bittereste watris schulen not anoye thee, in to whiche Y haue gaderid togidere cursis;
ellis if thou bowidst awei fro thin hosebonde, and art defoulid, and hast leyn with another man,
thou schalt be suget to these cursyngys; the Lord yyue thee in to cursyng, and in to ensaumple of alle men in his puple; `the Lord make thin hipe to wexe rotun, and thi wombe swelle, and be brokun;
cursid watris entre in to thi wombe, and while the wombe swellith, thin hipe wexe rotun. And the womman schal answere, Amen! amen!
And the preest schal write thes cursis in a litil book, and he schal do awey tho cursis with bittereste watris, in to whiche he gaderide cursis,
and he schal yyue to hir to drynke. And whanne sche hath drunke tho watris,
the preest schal take of hir hond the sacrifice of gelousie, and he schal reise it bifor the Lord, and he schal putte on the auter;
so oneli that he take bifore an handful of sacrifice `of that that is offrid, and brenne on the auter, and so yyue drynke to the womman the moost bittere watris.
And whanne sche hath drunke tho watris, if sche is defoulid, and is gilti of auowtrie, for the hosebonde is dispisid, the watris of cursyng schulen passe thorouy hir, and while the wombe is bolnyd, the hipe schal wexe rotun, and the womman schal be in to cursyng and in to ensaumple to al the puple.
That if sche is not pollutid, sche schal be harmeles, and schal brynge forth fre children.
This is the lawe of gelousie, if a womman bowith awei fro hir hosebonde, and is defoulid,
and the hosebonde is stirid with the spirit of gelousye, and bryngith hir in to the `siyt of the Lord, and the preest doith to hir bi alle thingis that ben writun, the hosebonde schal be with out synne,
and sche schal resseyue hir wickidnesse.

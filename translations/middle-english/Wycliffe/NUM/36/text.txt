Forsothe and the princes of the meynees of Galaad sone of Machir, sone of Manasses, of the generacioun of the sones of Joseph, neiyiden, and spaken to Moises bifor the princes of Israel,
and seiden, The Lord comaundide to thee oure lord, that thou schuldist departe the lond bi lot to the sones of Israel, and that thou schuldist yyue to the douytris of Salphaat, oure brothir, possessioun due to the fadir.
And if men of anothir lynage schulen take to wyues these douytris, her possessioun schal sue, and it schal be translatid to anothir lynage, and schal be decreessid fro oure eritage;
and so it schal be doon, that whanne the iubilee, that is, the fiftithe yeer of remyssioun, cometh, the departyng of lottis be schent, and that the possessioun of othere men passe to othere men.
Moises answeride to the sones of Israel, and seide, for the Lord comaundide, The lynage of the sones of Joseph spak riytfuli,
and this lawe is denounsid of the Lord on the douytris of Salphaat; be thei weddid to whiche men thei wolen, oneli to the men of her lynage;
lest the possessioun of the sones of Joseph be meddlid fro lynage in to lynage. For alle men schulen wedde wyues of her lynage and kynrede;
and alle wymmen  schulen take hosebondis of the same lynage, that the erytage dwelle in meynees,
and lynagis be not meddlid to hem silf, but dwelle so,
as tho ben departid of the Lord. And the douytris of Salphaat diden, as it was comaundid to hem.
And Maala, and Thersa, and Egla, and Melcha, and Noha, weren weddid to the sones of her fadris brother,
of the meynee of Manaasses, that was `the sone of Joseph, and the possessioun that was youun to hem, dwellide in the lynage and meynee of her fadir.
These ben the comaundementis and domes, whiche the Lord comaundide, bi the hond of Moyses, to the sones of Israel, in the feeldi places of Moab, aboue Jordan, ayens Jericho.

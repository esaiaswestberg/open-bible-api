Forsothe Baldach Suytes answeride, and seide,
Power and drede is anentis hym, that is, God, that makith acordyng in hise hiye thingis.
Whether noumbre is of hise knyytis? and on whom schyneth not his liyt?
Whether a man comparisound to God mai be iustified, ether borun of a womman mai appere cleene?
Lo! also the moone schyneth not, and sterris ben not cleene in `his siyt;
hou miche more a man rot, and the sone of a man a worm, is vncleene `and vile, if he is comparisound to God.

Her litle children goen out as flockis; and her yonge children `maken fulli ioye with pleies.

Thei schulen be as chaffis bifor the face of the wynd; and as a deed sparcle, whiche the whirlewynd scaterith abrood.
God schal kepe the sorewe of the fadir to hise sones; and whanne he hath yoldun, thanne he schal wite.
Hise iyen schulen se her sleyng; and he schal drynke of the stronge veniaunce of Almyyti God.
For whi what perteyneth it to hym of his hows aftir hym, thouy the noumbre of his monethis be half takun awey?

And netheles thei schulen slepe togidere in dust, and wormes schulen hile hem.
Certis Y knowe youre wickid thouytis, and sentensis ayens me.

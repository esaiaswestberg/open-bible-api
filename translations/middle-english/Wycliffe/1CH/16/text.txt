Therfor thei brouyten the arke of God, and settiden it in the myddis of the tabernacle, that Dauid hadde araied therto; and thei offriden brent sacrifices and pesible sacrifices bifor the Lord.
And whanne Dauid offrynge brent sacrifices and pesible sacrifices hadde fillid, he blesside the puple in the name of the Lord;
and departide to alle to ech bi hym silf fro a man til to a womman o cake of breed, and a part of rostid fleisch of a bugle, and flour fried in oile.
And he ordeynede bifor the arke of the Lord, of the Leuytis, that schulden mynystre, and haue mynde of the werkis of the Lord, and glorifie and preyse the Lord God of Israel;

And he ordeynede that to Jacob in to a comaundement; and to Israel in to euerlastynge couenaunt.
And seide, To thee Y schal yyue the lond of Canaan; the part of youre erytage.
Whanne thei weren fewe in noumbre; litle, and pilgrims therof.
And thei passiden fro folk in to the folk; and fro a rewme to another puple.
He suffride not ony man falseli chalenge hem; but he blamyde kyngis for hem.
Nyle ye touche my cristis; and nyle ye do wickidli ayens my prophetis.

Telle ye among hethen men his glorie; hise merueylis among alle puplis.
For the Lord is greet, and worthi to be preisid ful myche; and he is orible, `ethir griseful, ouer alle goddis.
For alle the goddis of puplis ben idols; but the Lord made heuenes.
Knoulechyng and greet doyng ben bifor hym; strengthe and ioy ben in the place of hym.
Ye meynees of puplis, `bringe ye to the Lord; brynge ye to the Lord glorie and empire.

Knouleche ye to the Lord, for he is good; for his mersi is withouten ende.
And seie ye, Thou God oure sauyour, saue vs, and gadere vs, and delyuere vs fro hethen men; that we knowleche to thin hooli name, and be fulli glade in thi songis.
Blessid be the Lord God of Israel fro with oute bigynnyng and til `in to with outen ende; and al the puple seie, Amen, and seie heriyng to God.

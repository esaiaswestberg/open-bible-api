But speke thou tho thingis that bisemen hoolsum teching;

Moneste thou yonge wymmen, that thei loue here hosebondis, that thei loue her children;
and that thei be prudent, chast, sobre, hauynge cure of the hous, benygne, suget to her hosebondis, that the word of God be not blasfemyd.
Also moneste thou yonge men, that thei be sobre.

An hoolsum word, and vnrepreuable; that he that is of the contrarie side, be aschamed, hauynge noon yuel thing to seie of you.
Moneste thou seruauntis to be suget to her lordis; in alle thingis plesinge, not ayenseiynge, not defraudynge,

For the grace of `God, oure sauyour,

abidinge the blessid hope and the comyng of the glorie of the greet God, and of oure sauyour Jhesu Crist;
that yaf hym silf for vs, to ayenbie vs fro al wickidnesse, and make clene to hym silf a puple acceptable, and suere of good werkis.
Speke thou these thingis, and moneste thou, and repreue thou with al comaundement; no man dispise thee.

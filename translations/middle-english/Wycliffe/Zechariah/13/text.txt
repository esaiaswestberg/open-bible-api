In that dai an open welle schal be to the hous of Dauid, and to men dwellynge at Jerusalem, in to waischyng a wey of a synful man, and of womman defoulid in vnclene blood.
And it schal be, in that dai, seith the Lord of oostis, Y schal distrie names of idols fro `the lond, and thei schulen no more be `thouyt on; and Y schal take awei fro erthe false profetis, and an vnclene spirit.
And it schal be, whanne ony man schal profesie ouer, his fadir and modir that gendriden hym, schulen seie to hym, Thou schalt not lyue, for thou hast spoke leesyng in the name of the Lord; and his fadir and his modir, gendreris of hym, schulen `togidere fitche hym, whanne he hath profesied.
And it schal be, in that dai profetis schulen be confoundid, ech of his visioun, whanne he schal profesie; nether thei schulen be hilid with mentil of sak, that thei lie;
but `thei schulen seie, Y am not a profete; Y am a man `erthe tiliere, for Adam is myn ensaumple fro my yongthe.
And it schal be seid to hym, What ben these woundis in the myddil of thin hondis? And he schal seie, With these Y was woundid in the hous of hem that louyden me.
Swerd, be thou reisid on my scheepherde, and on a man cleuynge to me, seith the Lord of oostis; smyte thou the scheepherde, and scheep of the floc schulen be scaterid. And Y schal turne myn hond to the litle.
And twei partis schulen be in ech lond, seith the Lord, and thei schulen be scaterid, and schulen faile, and the thridde part schal be left in it.
And Y schal lede the thridde part bi fier, and Y schal brenne hem, as siluer is brent, and Y schal preue hem, as gold is preuyd. He schal clepe to help my name, and Y schal graciously here him; and Y schal seie, Thou art my puple, and he schal seie, Thou art my Lord God.

The word which Ysaie, the sone of Amos, siy on Juda and Jerusalem.
And in the laste daies the hil of the hous of the Lord schal be maad redi in the cop of hillis, and schal be reisid aboue litle hillis. And alle hethene men schulen flowe to hym;
and many puplis schulen go, and schulen seie, Come ye, stie we to the hil of the Lord, and to the hous of God of Jacob; and he schal teche vs hise weies, and we schulen go in the pathis of hym. For whi the lawe schal go out of Syon, and the word of the Lord fro Jerusalem.
And he schal deme hethene men, and he schal repreue many puplis; and thei schulen welle togidere her swerdes in to scharris, and her speris in to sikelis, ether sithes; folk schal no more reise swerd ayens folk, and thei schulen no more be exercisid to batel.
Come ye, the hous of Jacob, and go we in the liyt of the Lord.
Forsothe thou hast cast awei thi puple, the hous of Jacob, for thei ben fillid as sum tyme bifore; and thei hadden false dyuynouris bi the chiteryng of briddis, as Filisteis, and thei cleuyden to alien children.
The lond is fillid with siluer and gold, and noon ende is of the tresouris therof; and the lond therof is fillid with horsis, and the foure horsid cartis therof ben vnnoumbrable.
And the lond therof is fillid with ydols, and thei worschipiden the werk of her hondis, which her fyngris maden;
and a man bowide hymsilf, and a man of ful age was maad low. Therfor foryyue thou not to hem.
Entre thou, puple of Juda, in to a stoon, be thou hid in a diche in erthe, fro the face of the drede of the Lord, and fro the glorie of his mageste.
The iyen of an hiy man ben maad low, and the hiynesse of men schal be bowid doun; forsothe the Lord aloone schal be enhaunsid in that dai.
For the dai of the Lord of oostis schal be on ech proud man and hiy, and on ech boostere, and he schal be maad low;
and on alle the cedres of the Liban hiye and reisid, and on alle the ookis of Baisan,
and on alle hiy munteyns, and on alle litle hillis, `that ben reisid;
and on ech hiy tour, and on ech strong wal;
and on alle schippis of Tharsis, and on al thing which is fair in siyt.
And al the hiynesse of men schal be bowid doun, and the hiynesse of men schal be maad low; and the Lord aloone schal be reisid in that dai,
and idols schulen be brokun togidere outirli.
And thei schulen entre in to dennes of stoonys, and in to the swolewis of erthe, fro the face of the inward drede of the Lord, and fro the glorie of his maieste, whanne he schal ryse to smyte the lond.
In that dai a man schal caste awei the idols of his siluer, and the symylacris of his gold, whiche he hadde maad to hym silf, for to worschipe moldewarpis and backis, `ether rere myis.
And he schal entre in to chynnis, ethir crasyngis, of stoonys, and in to the caues of hard roochis, fro the face of the inward drede of the Lord, and fro the glorie of his mageste, whanne he schal ryse to smyte the lond.
Therfor ceesse ye fro a man, whos spirit is in hise nose thirlis, for he is arettid hiy.

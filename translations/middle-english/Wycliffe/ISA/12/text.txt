And thou schalt seie in that dai, Lord, Y schal knouleche to thee, for thou were wrooth to me; thi strong venieaunce is turned, and thou hast coumfortid me.
Lo! God is my sauyour, Y schal do feithfuli, and Y schal not drede. For whi the Lord is my strengthe and my preysyng, and he is maad to me in to helthe.
Ye schulen drawe watris with ioie of the wellis of the sauyour.
And ye schulen seie in that dai, Knouleche ye to the Lord, and clepe ye his name in to help; make ye knowun hise fyndyngis among puplis; haue ye mynde, that his name is hiy.
Synge ye to the Lord, for he hath do worschipfuli; telle ye this in al erthe.
Thou dwellyng of Syon, make ful out ioie, and preise; for whi the hooli of Israel is greet in the myddis of thee.

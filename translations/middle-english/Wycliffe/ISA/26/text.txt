In that dai this song schal be sungun in the lond of Juda. The citee of oure strengthe; the sauyour schal be set ther ynne, the wal and the `fore wal.
Opene ye the yatis, and the iust folk schal entre, kepynge treuthe.
The elde errour is gon awei; thou schalt kepe pees, pees, for thou, Lord, we hopiden in thee.
Ye han hopid in the Lord, in euerlastynge worldis, in the Lord God, strong with outen ende.
For he schal bowe doun hem that dwellen an hiy, and he schal make low an hiy citee; he schal make it low `til to the erthe; he schal drawe it doun `til to the dust.
The foot of a pore man schal defoule it, and the steppis of nedi men schulen defoule it.
The weie of a iust man is riytful, the path of a iust man is riytful to go.
And in the weie of thi domes, Lord, we suffriden thee; thi name, and thi memorial is in desir of soule.
My soule schal desire thee in the niyt, but also with my spirit in myn entrails; fro the morewtid Y schal wake to thee. Whanne thou schalt make thi domes in erthe, alle dwelleris of the world schulen lerne riytfulnesse.
Do we merci to the wickid man, and he schal not lerne to do riytfulnesse; in the lond of seyntis he dide wickid thingis, and he schal not se the glorie of the Lord.
Lord, thin hond be enhaunsid, that thei se not; puplis hauynge enuye se, and be schent, and fier deuoure thin enemyes.
Lord, thou schalt yyue pees to vs, for thou hast wrouyt alle oure werkis in vs.
Oure Lord God, lordis hadden vs in possessioun, withouten thee; oneli in thee haue we mynde of thi name.
Thei that dien, lyue not, and giauntis risen not ayen. Therfor thou hast visityd, and hast al-to broke hem, and thou hast lost al the mynde of hem; and Lord, thou hast foryoue to a folc,
thou hast foryoue to a folc. Whether thou art glorified? thou hast maad fer fro thee all the endis of erthe.
Lord, in angwisch thei souyten thee; in the tribulacioun of grutchyng thi doctryn to hem.
As sche that conseyuede, whanne sche neiyeth sorewful to the child beryng, crieth in her sorewis, so we ben maad, Lord, of thi face.
We han conseyued, and we han as trauelid of child, and we han childid the spirit of helthe; we diden not riytfulnesse in erthe. Therfor the dwelleris of erthe fellen not doun; thi deed men schulen lyue,
and my slayn men schulen rise ayen. Ye that dwellen in dust, awake, and herie; for whi the deew of liyt is thi deew, and thou schalt drawe doun the lond of giauntis in to fallyng.
Go thou, my puple, entre in to thi beddis, close thi doris on thee, be thou hid a litil at a moment, til indignacioun passe.
For lo! the Lord schal go out of his place, to visite the wickidnesse of the dwellere of erthe ayens hym; and the erthe schal schewe his blood, and schal no more hile hise slayn men.

And it was don in the daies of Achas, the sone of Joathan, the sone of Osias, kyng of Juda, Rasyn, the kyng of Sirie, and Facee, the sone of Romelie, the kyng of Israel, stieden to Jerusalem, for to fiyte ayens it; and thei myyten not ouercome it.
And thei telden to the hous of Dauid, and seiden, Sirie hath restid on Effraym, and the herte of hym and of his puple was mouyd togidere, as the trees of wodis ben mouyd of the face of the wynd.
And the Lord seide to Isaie, Go thou out, and Jasub, thi sone, which is left, in to the meetyng of Achas, at the laste ende of the water cundijt of the hiyere cisterne, in the weie of the feeld of the fullere.
And thou schalt seie to hym, Se thou, that thou be stille; nyle thou drede, and thin herte be not aferd of twei tailis of these brondis smokynge in the wraththe of woodnesse, of Rasyn, kynge of Sirie, and of the sone of Romelye.
For Sirie, and Effraym, and the sone of Romelie, han bigunne yuel councel ayens thee, and seien, Stie we to Juda,
and reise we hym, and drawe we hym out to vs; and sette we a kyng in the myddis therof, the sone of Tabeel.
The Lord God seith these thingis, This schal not be, and it schal not stonde;
but Damask schal be the heed of Sirie, and Rasyn `schal be the heed of Damask; and yit sixti yeer and fiue, and Effraym schal faile to be a puple;
and Samarie shal faile to be the heed of Effraym, and the sone of Romelie `schal faile to be heed of Samarie. Forsothe if ye schulen not bileue, ye schulen not dwelle.
And the Lord addide to speke to Achas,
and seide, Axe thou to thee a signe of thi Lord God, in to the depthe of helle, ethir in to heiythe aboue.
And Achas seide, Y schal not axe, and Y schal not tempte the Lord.
And Ysaie seide, Therfor the hous of Dauid, here ye; whether it is litil to you to be diseseful to men, for ye ben diseseful also to my God?
For this thing the Lord hym silf schal yyue a signe to you. Lo! a virgyn schal conseyue, and schal bere a sone; and his name schal be clepid Emanuel.
He schal ete botere and hony, that he kunne repreue yuel, and cheese good.
For whi bifore that the child kunne repreue yuel, and chese good, the lond, which thou wlatist, schal be forsakun of the face of her twei kyngis.
The Lord schal brynge on thee, and on thi puple, and on the hous of thi fadir, daies that camen not fro the daies of departyng of Effraym fro Juda, with the kyng of Assiriens.
And it schal be, in that dai the Lord schal hisse to a flie, which is in the laste parte of the floodis of Egipt; and to a bee, which is in the lond of Assur;
and `alle so schulen come, and schulen reste in the strondis of valeis, and in caues of stoonis, and in alle places of buyschis, and in alle hoolis.
And in that dai the Lord schal schaue with a scharp rasour in these men, that ben biyendis the flood, in the kyng of Assiriens, the heed, and heeris of the feet, and al the beerd.
And it schal be, in that day a man schal nurische a cow of oxis, and twei scheep,
and for the plentee of mylk he schal ete botere; for whi ech man that schal be left in the myddis of the lond, schal ete boter and hony.
And it schal be, in that dai ech place where a thousand vyneris schulen be worth a thousynde platis of siluer, and schulen be in to thornes and breeris,
men schulen entre thidur with bouwis and arowis; for whi breris and thornes schulen be in al the lond.
And alle hillis that schulen be purgid with a sarpe, the drede of thornes and of breris schal not come thidir; and it schal be in to lesewe of oxen, and in to treding of scheep.

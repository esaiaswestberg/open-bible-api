Alle that thirsten, come ye to watris, and ye han not siluer, haaste, bie ye, and ete ye; come ye, bie ye, with out siluer and with outen ony chaungyng, wyn and mylk.
Whi peisen ye siluer, and not in looues, and youre trauel, not in fulnesse? Ye herynge here me, and ete ye good, and youre soule schal delite in fatnesse.
Bowe ye youre eere, and `come ye to me; here ye, and youre soule schal lyue; and Y schal smyte with you a couenaunt euerlastynge, the feithful mercies of Dauid.
Lo! Y yaf hym a witnesse to puplis, a duyk and a comaundour to folkis.
Lo! thou schalt clepe folkis, whiche thou knewist not; and folkis, that knewen not thee, schulen renne to thee; for thi Lord God, and the hooli of Israel, for he glorifiede thee.
Seke ye the Lord, while he mai be foundun; clepe ye hym to help, while he is niy.
An vnfeithful man forsake his weie, and a wickid man forsake hise thouytis; and turne he ayen to the Lord, and he schal haue merci on hym, and to oure God, for he is myche to foryyue.
For why my thouytis ben not youre thouytis, and my weies ben not youre weies, seith the Lord.
For as heuenys ben reisid fro erthe, so my weies ben reisid fro youre weies, and my thouytis fro youre thouytis.
And as reyn and snow cometh doun fro heuene, and turneth no more ayen thidur, but it fillith the erthe, and bischedith it, and makith it to buriowne, and yyueth seed to hym that sowith, and breed to hym that etith,
so schal be my word, that schal go out of my mouth. It schal not turne ayen voide to me, but it schal do what euer thingis Y wolde, and it schal haue prosperite in these thingis to whiche Y sente it.
For ye schulen go out in gladnesse, and ye schulen be led forth in pees; mounteyns and litil hillis schulen synge heriynge bifore you, and alle the trees of the cuntrei schulen make ioie with hond.
A fir tre schal grow for a firse, and a mirte tre schal wexe for a nettil; and the Lord schal be nemyd in to a signe euerlastynge, that schal not be doon awei.

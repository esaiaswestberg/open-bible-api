And whanne Jabyn, kyng of Asor, hadde herd these thingis, he sente to Jobab, kyng of Madian, and to the kyng of Semeron, and to the kyng of Acsaph; forsothe to the kyngis of the north,
that dwelliden in the hilli places, and in the pleyn ayens the south of Seneroth, and in the feeldi places, and cuntreis of Dor, bisidis the see,
and `to Cananei fro the eest and west, and to Ammorrey, and Ethei, and Feresei, and Jebusei, in the `hilli places, and to Euey, that dwellide at the rootis of Hermon, in the lond of Maspha.
And alle yeden out with her cumpanyes, a ful myche puple, as the grauel which is in the `brynk of the see, and horsis, and charis, of greet multitude.
And alle these kyngis camen togidere at the watris of Meron, to fiyte ayens Israel.
And the Lord seyde to Josue, Drede thou not hem, for to morewe, in this same our, Y schal bitake alle these men to be woundid in the siyt of Israel; thou schalt hoxe `the horsis of hem, and thou schalt brenne `the charis bi fier.
And Josue cam, and al his oost with hym, ayens hem sodenli, at the watris of Meron, `and felden on hem.
And the Lord bitook hem in to the hondis of Israel; whiche smytiden hem, `that is, the hethen kyngis and her oostes, and pursueden `til to grete Sidon, and the watris of Maserophoth, and to the feeld of Maspha, which is at the eest part therof. Josue smoot so alle men, that he lefte no relikis of hem;
and he dide as the Lord comaundide to hym; he hoxide `the horsis of hem, and brente the charis.
And he turnede ayen anoon, and took Asor, and `smoot bi swerd the kyng therof; for Asor helde bi eld tyme the prinsehed among alle these rewmes.
And `he smoot alle persoones that dwelliden there, he lefte not ony relikys therynne, but he wastide alle thingis `til to deeth; also he distriede thilke citee bi brennyng.
And he took alle `citees bi cumpas, and `the kyngis of hem, and smoot, and dide awei, as Moises, the `seruaunt of the Lord,
comaundide to hym, without citees that weren set in the grete hillis, and in litle hillis; and Israel brente the othere citees; flawme wastide oneli o citee, Asor, the strongeste.
And the sones of Israel departiden to hem silf al the prei, and werk beestis of these citees, whanne alle men weren slayn.
As the Lord comaundide to his seruaunt Moises, so Moises comaundide to Josue, and `he fillide alle thingis; he passide not of alle comaundementis, `nether o word sotheli, which the Lord comaundide to Moises.
And so Josue took al the `lond of the hillis, and of the south, the lond of Gosen, and the pleyn, and the west coost, and the hil of Israel, and the feeldi places therof;
and the part of the hil that stieth to Seir `til to Baalgath, bi the pleyn of Liban vndur the hil of Hermon; Josue took, and smoot, and killide alle the kyngis of tho places.
Josue fauyt myche tyme ayens these kyngis;
`no citee was, which bitook not it silf to the sones of Israel, out takun Euey that dwellide in Gabaon; he took alle bi batel.
For it was the sentence of the Lord, that `the hertis of hem schulde be maad hard, and that thei schulden fiyte ayens Israel, and schulden falle, and schulden not disserue ony mercy, and schulden perische, as the Lord comaundide to Moises.
Josue cam in that tyme, and killide Enachym, that is, giauntis, fro the `hilli placis of Ebron, and of Dabir, and of Anab, and fro al the hil of Juda, and of Israel, and dide awei `the citees of hem.
He lefte not ony man of the generacioun of Enachim in the lond of the sones of Israel, without the citees of Gasa, and Geth, and Azotus, in whiche aloone thei weren left.
Therfor Josue took al the lond, as the Lord spak to Moyses, and he yaf it in to possessioun to the sones of Israel, bi her partis and lynagis; and the lond restide fro batels.

Kepe thou the monethe of newe fruytis, and of the bigynnyng of somer, that thou make pask to thi Lord God; for in this monethe thi Lord God ledde thee out of Egipt in the nyyt.
And thou schalt offre pask to thi Lord God, of scheep and of oxun, in the place which thi Lord God chees, that his name dwelle there.
Thou schalt not ete `ther ynne breed `diyt with sourdouy; in seuene daies thou schalt ete breed of affliccioun, with out sourdouy, for in drede thou yedist out  of Egipt, that thou haue mynde of the dai of thi goyng out of Egipt, in alle the daies of thi lijf.

Thou schalt not mow offre pask in ech of thi citees whiche thi Lord God schal yyue to thee,

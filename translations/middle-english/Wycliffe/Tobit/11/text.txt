Therfor if it plesith thee, go we bifore; and the meineis, with thi wijf togidere and with the beestis, sue oure weie with soft goynge.
And whanne this pleside, that thei schulden go, Raphael seide to Tobie, Take with thee of the galle of the fisch, for it schal be nedeful. Therfor Tobie took of that galle, and thei yeden forth.
Forsothe Anne sat bisidis the weie ech dai in the cop of the hil, fro whennus sche myyte biholde fro afer.

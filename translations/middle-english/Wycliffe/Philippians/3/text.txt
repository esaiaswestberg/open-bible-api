Hennus forward, my britheren, haue ye ioye in the Lord. To write to you the same thingis, to me it is not slow, and to you it is necessarie.
Se ye houndis, se ye yuele werk men, se ye dyuysioun.
For we ben circumcisioun, which bi spirit seruen to God, and glorien in Crist Jhesu, and han not trist in the fleisch,
thouy Y haue trust, yhe, in the fleisch. If ony othere man is seyn to triste in the fleisch,
Y more, that was circumcidid in the eiytthe dai, of the kyn of Israel, of the lynage of Beniamyn, an Ebrew of Ebrewis, bi the lawe a Farisee,
bi loue pursuynge the chirche of God, bi riytwisnesse that is in the lawe lyuynge with out playnt.
But whiche thingis weren to me wynnyngis, Y haue demed these apeyryngis for Crist.
Netheles Y gesse alle thingis to be peirement for the cleer science of Jhesu Crist my Lord. For whom Y made alle thingis peyrement, and Y deme as drit,
that Y wynne Crist, and that Y be foundun in hym, not hauynge my riytwisnesse that is of the lawe, but that that is of the feith of Crist Jhesu, that is of God the riytwisnesse in feith,
to knowe hym, and the vertu of his risyng ayen, and the felouschipe of his passioun, and be maad lijk to his deeth,
if on ony maner Y come to the resurreccioun that is fro deth.
Not that now Y haue takun, or now am parfit; but Y sue, if in ony maner Y comprehende, in which thing also Y am comprehendid of Crist Jhesu.
Bretheren, Y deme me not that Y haue comprehendid; but o thing, Y foryete tho thingis that ben bihyndis, and stretche forth my silf to tho thingis that ben bifore,
and pursue to the ordeyned mede of the hiy clepyng of God in Crist Jhesu.
Therfor who euere we ben perfit, feele we this thing. And if ye vndurstonden in othere manere ony thing, this thing God schal schewe to you.
Netheles to what thing we han comun, that we vndurstonden the same thing, and that we perfitli dwelle in the same reule.
Britheren, be ye my foleweris, and weyte ye hem that walken so, as ye han oure fourme.
For many walken, whiche Y haue seid ofte to you, but now Y wepinge seie, the enemyes of Cristis cros,
who ende is deth, whos god is the wombe, and the glorie in confusioun of hem, that saueren ertheli thingis.
But oure lyuyng is in heuenes; fro whennus also we abiden the sauyour oure Lord Jhesu Crist,
which schal reforme the bodi of oure mekenesse, that is maad lijk to the bodi of his clerenesse, bi the worching bi which he mai `also make alle thingis suget to hym.

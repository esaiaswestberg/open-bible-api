Therfor if ony coumfort is in Crist, if ony solace of charite, if ony felouschipe of spirit, if ony inwardnesse of merci doyng,
fille ye my ioye, that ye vndurstonde the same thing, and haue the same charite, of o wille, and feelen the same thing;
no thing bi strijf, nether by veyn glorie, but in mekenesse, demynge eche othere to be heiyer than hym silf;
not biholdinge ech bi hym silf what thingis ben his owne, but tho thingis that ben of othere men.
And fele ye this thing in you, which also in Crist Jhesu;
that whanne he was in the forme of God, demyde not raueyn, that hym silf were euene to God;
but he lowide hym silf, takinge the forme of a seruaunt, and was maad in to the licknesse of men, and in abite was foundun as a man.
He mekide hym silf, and was maad obedient to the deth, yhe, to the deth of the cross.
For which thing God enhaunside hym, and yaf to hym a name that is aboue al name;
that in the name of Jhesu ech kne be bowid, of heuenli thingis, of ertheli thingis, and of hellis;
and ech tunge knouleche, that the Lord Jhesu Crist is in the glorie of God the fadir.
Therfor, my most dereworthe britheren, as euere more ye han obeischid, not in my presence onely, but myche more now in myn absence, worche ye with drede and trembling youre heelthe.
For it is God that worchith in you, bothe to wilne, and to performe, for good wille.
And do ye alle thingis with out grutchingis and doutyngis;
that ye be with out playnt, and symple as the sones of God, with out repreef, in the myddil of a schrewid nacioun and a weiward; among whiche ye schynen as yyueris of liyt in the world.
And holde ye togidere the word of lijf to my glorie in the day of Crist; for Y haue not runnen in veyn, nether Y haue trauelid in veyn.
But thouy Y be offrid or slayn on the sacrifice and seruyce of youre feith, Y haue ioye, and Y thanke you alle.
And the same thing haue ye ioye, and thanke ye me.
And Y hope in the Lord Jhesu, that Y schal sende Tymothe soone to you, that Y be of good coumfort, whanne tho thingis ben knowun that ben aboute you.
For Y haue no man so of o wille, that is bisi for you with clene affeccioun.
For alle men seken tho thingis that ben her owne, not tho that ben of Crist Jhesu.
But knowe ye the asaie of hym, for as a sone to the fadir he hath seruyd with me in the gospel.
Therfor Y hope that Y schal sende hym to you, anoon as Y se what thingis ben aboute me.
And Y triste in the Lord, that also my silf schal come to you soone.
And Y gesside it nedeful to sende to you Epafrodite, my brother and euene worchere, and myn euene knyyt, but youre apostle, and the mynystre of my nede.
For he desiride you alle, and he was sorewful, therfor that ye herden that he was sijk.
For he was sijk to the deth, but God hadde merci on him; and not oneli on hym, but also on me, lest Y hadde heuynesse on heuynesse.
Therfor more hastili Y sente hym, that whanne ye han seyn hym, ye haue ioye eft, and Y be withouten heuynesse.
Therfor resseyue ye hym with al ioye in the Lord, and haue ye suche with al onour.
For the werk of Crist he wente to deth, yyuynge his lijf, that he schulde fulfille that that failide of you anentis my seruyce.

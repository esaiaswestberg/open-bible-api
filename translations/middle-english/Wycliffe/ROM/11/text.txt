Therfor Y seie, Whether God hath put awei his puple? God forbede. For Y am an Israelite, of the seed of Abraham, of the lynage of Beniamyn.
God hath not put awei his puple, which he bifor knew. Whether ye witen not, what the scripture seith in Elie? Hou he preieth God ayens Israel,
Lord, thei han slayn thi prophetis, thei han vndurdoluun thin auteris, and Y am lefte aloone, and thei seken my lijf.
But what seith Goddis answere to hym? Y haue left to me seuene thousyndes of men, that han not bowid her knees bifore Baal.
So therfor also in this tyme, the relifs ben maad saaf, bi the chesyng of the grace of God.
And if it be bi the grace of God, it is not now of werkis; ellis grace is not now grace.
What thanne? Israel hath not getun this that he souyte, but eleccioun hath getun; and the othere ben blyndid.
As it is writun, God yaf to hem a spirit of compunccioun, iyen that thei se not, and eeris, that thei here not, in to this dai.
And Dauith seith, Be the boord of hem maad in to a gryn bifor hem, and in to catchyng, and in to sclaundre, and in to yeldyng to hem.
Be the iyen of hem maad derk, that thei se not; and bowe thou doun algatis the bak of hem.
Therfor Y seie, Whether thei offendiden so, that thei schulden falle doun? God forbede. But bi the gilt of hem helthe is maad to hethene men, that thei sue hem.
That if the gilt of hem ben richessis of the world, and the makyng lesse of hem ben richessis of hethene men, hou myche more the plente of hem?
But Y seie to you, hethene men, for as longe as Y am apostle of hethene men, Y schal onoure my mynysterie,
if in ony maner Y stire my fleisch for to folowe, and that Y make summe of hem saaf.
For if the loss of hem is the recouncelyng of the world, what is the takyng vp, but lijf of deede men?
For if a litil part of that that is tastid be hooli, the hool gobet is hooli; and if the roote is hooli, also the braunchis.
What if ony of the braunchis ben brokun, whanne thou were a wielde olyue tre, art graffid among hem, and art maad felowe of the roote, and of the fatnesse of the olyue tre,
nyle thou haue glorie ayens the braunchis. For if thou gloriest, thou berist not the roote, but the roote thee.
Therfor thou seist, The braunchis ben brokun, that Y be graffid in.
Wel, for vnbileue the braunchis ben brokun; but thou stondist bi feith. Nyle thou sauere hiye thing,
but drede thou, for if God sparide not the kyndli braunchis, lest perauenture he spare not thee.
Therfor se the goodnesse, and the fersnesse of God; yhe, the feersnesse in to hem that felden doun, but the goodnesse of God in to thee, if thou dwellist in goodnesse, ellis also thou schalt be kit doun.
Yhe, and thei schulen be set yn, if thei dwellen not in vnbileue. For God is myyti, to sette hem in eftsoone.
For if thou art kit doun of the kyndeli wielde olyue tre, and ayens kynd art set in to a good olyue tre, hou myche more thei that ben bi kynde, schulen be set in her olyue tree?
But, britheren, Y wole not that ye vnknowen this mysterie, that ye be not wise to you silf; for blyndenesse hath feld a parti in Israel, til that the plente of hethene men entride,
and so al Israel schulde be maad saaf. As it is writun, He schal come of Syon, that schal delyuere, and turne awei the wickidnesse of Jacob.
And this testament to hem of me, whanne Y schal do awei her synnes.
Aftir the gospel thei ben enemyes for you, but thei ben moost dereworthe bi the eleccioun for the fadris.
And the yiftis and the cleping of God ben with outen forthenkyng.
And as sum tyme also ye bileueden not to God, but now ye han gete mercy for the vnbileue of hem;
so and these now bileueden not in to youre merci, that also thei geten merci.
For God closide alle thingis togidere in vnbileue, that he haue mercy on alle.
O! the heiynesse of the ritchessis of the wisdom and of the kunnyng of God; hou incomprehensible ben hise domes, and hise weies ben vnserchable.
For whi who knew the wit of the Lord, or who was his counselour? or who formere yaf to hym,
and it schal be quyt to hym?
For of hym, and bi hym, and in hym ben alle thingis. To hym be glorie in to worldis. Amen.

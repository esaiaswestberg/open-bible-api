And the word of the Lord was maad to me,
and he seide, Sone of man, thou dwellist in the myddis of an hous terrynge to wraththe, which han iyen to se, and seen not, and eeris to here, and heren not; for it is an hous terrynge to wraththe.
Therfor thou, sone of man, make to thee vessels of passing ouer, and thou schalt passe ouer bi dai bifor hem; forsothe thou schalt passe ouer fro thi place to another place, in the siyt of hem, if perauenture thei biholden, for it is an hous terrynge to wraththe.
And thou schalt bere withoutforth thi vessels, as the vessels of a man passynge ouer bi dai, in the siyt of hem; sotheli thou schalt go out in the euentid bifore hem, as a man passynge forth goith out.
Bifore the iyen of hem digge the wal to thee, and thou
schalt go out thorouy it in the siyt of hem. Thou schalt be borun on schuldris, thou schalt be borun out in derknesse; thou schalt hile thi face, and thou schalt not se the erthe, for Y haue youe thee a signe
of thing to comynge to the hous of Israel. Therfor Y dide as the Lord comaundide to me; Y brouyte forth my vessels, as the vessels of a man passynge ouer bi dai, and in the euentid Y diggide a wal to me with hond; Y yede out in derknesse, and Y was borun on schuldris,
in the siyt of hem. And the word of the Lord was maad eerli to me,
and he seide, Sone of man, whether the hous of Israel, the hous terrynge to wraththe, seiden not to thee, What doist thou?
Seie thou to hem, The Lord God seith these thingis, This birthun is on the duyk, which is in Jerusalem, and on al the hous of Israel, which is in the myddis of hem.
Seie thou, Y am youre signe of thing to comynge; as Y dide, so it schal be don to hem; thei schulen go in to passynge ouer, and in to caitifte.
And the duyk which is in the myddis of hem, schal be borun out on schuldris, and he schal go out in derknesse; thei schulen digge the wal, and lede hym out; his face schal be hilid, that he se not with iye the erthe.
And Y schal stretche forth my net on hym, and he schal be takun in my net; and Y schal lede hym in to Babiloyne, in to the lond of Caldeis, and he schal not se that lond, and he schal die there.
And Y schal scatere in to ech wynd alle men that ben aboute hym, his help, and hise cumpenyes; and Y schal draw out the swerd aftir hem.
And thei schulen wite, that Y am the Lord, whanne Y schal scatere hem among hethene men, and schal sowe hem abrood in londis.
And Y schal leue of hem a fewe men fro swerd, and hungur, and pestilence, that thei telle out alle the grete trespassis of hem among hethene men, to which thei schulen entre; and thei schulen wite, that Y am the Lord.
And the word of the Lord was maad to me,
and he seide, Thou, sone of man, ete thi breed in disturblyng, but also drynke thi water in haaste and mourening.
And thou schalt seie to the puple of the lond, The Lord God seith these thingis to hem that dwellen in Jerusalem, in the lond of Israel, Thei schulen ete her breed in angwisch, and thei schulen drynke her watir in desolacioun; that the lond be desolat of his multitude, for the wickidnesse of alle men that dwellen ther ynne.
And citees that ben now enhabitid, shulen be desolat, and the lond schal be forsakun; and ye schulen wite, that Y am the Lord.
And the word of the Lord was maad to me,
and he seide, Sone of man, what is this prouerbe to you, of men seiynge in the lond of Israel, Daies schulen be differrid in to long tyme, and ech visioun shal perische?
Therfor seie thou to hem, The Lord God seith these thingis, Y schal make this prouerbe to ceesse, and it schal no more be seid comynli in Israel; and speke thou to hem, that the daies han neiyid, and ech word of profesie.
For whi ech visioun schal no more be voide, nether bifor tellyng of thing to comynge schal be douteful in the myddis of the sones of Israel;
for Y the Lord schal speke what euer word Y schal speke, and it schal be don; it schal no more be delaied, but in youre daies, ye hous terrynge to wraththe, Y schal speke a word, and Y schal do that word, seith the Lord God.
And the word of the Lord was maad to me, and he seide, Thou,
sone of man, lo! the hous of Israel, of hem that seien, The visioun which this man seeth, is in to manye daies, and this man profesieth in to longe tymes.
Therfor seie thou to hem, The Lord God seith these thingis, Ech word of me schal no more be deferrid; the word which Y schal speke, schal be fillid, seith the Lord God.

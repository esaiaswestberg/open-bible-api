These thingis Jhesus spak, and whanne he hadde cast vp hise iyen in to heuene, he seide, Fadir, the our cometh, clarifie thi sone, that thi sone clarifie thee.
As thou hast youun to hym power on ech fleisch, that al thing that thou hast youun to hym, he yyue to hem euerlastynge lijf.
And this is euerlastynge lijf, that thei knowe thee very God aloone, and whom thou hast sent, Jhesu Crist.
Y haue clarified thee on the erthe, Y haue endid the werk, that thou hast youun to me to do.
And now, fadir, clarifie thou me at thi silf, with the clerenesse that Y hadde at thee, bifor the world was maad.
Y haue schewid thi name to tho men, whiche thou hast youun to me of the world; thei weren thine, and thou hast youun hem to me, and thei han kept thi word.
And now thei han knowun, that alle thingis that thou hast youun to me, ben of thee.
For the wordis that thou hast youun to me, Y yaf to hem; and thei han takun, and han knowun verili, that Y wente out fro thee; and thei bileueden, that thou sentist me.
Y preie for hem, Y preye not for the world, but for hem that thou hast youun to me, for thei ben thine.
And alle my thingis ben thine, and thi thingis ben myne; and Y am clarified in hem.
And now Y am not in the world, and these ben in the world, and Y come to thee. Hooli fadir, kepe hem in thi name, whiche thou yauest to me, that thei ben oon, as we ben.
While Y was with hem, Y kepte hem in thi name; thilke that thou yauest to me, Y kepte, and noon of hem perischide, but the sone of perdicioun, that the scripture be fulfillid.
But now Y come to thee, and Y speke these thingis in the world, that thei haue my ioie fulfillid in hem silf.
Y yaf to hem thi word, and the world hadde hem in hate; for thei ben not of the world, as Y am not of the world.
Y preye not, that thou take hem awei fro the world, but that thou kepe hem fro yuel.
They ben not of the world, as Y am not of the world.
Halewe thou hem in treuth; thi word is treuthe.
As thou sentist me in to the world, also Y sente hem `in to the world.
And Y halewe my silf for hem, that also thei ben halewid in treuthe.
And Y preye not oneli for hem, but also for hem that schulden bileue in to me bi the word of hem;
that all ben oon, as thou, fadir, in me, and Y in thee, that also thei in vs be oon; that the world bileue, that thou hast sent me.
And Y haue youun to hem the clerenesse, that thou hast youun to me, that thei ben oon,
as we ben oon; Y in hem, and thou in me, that thei be endid in to oon; and that the world knowe, that thou sentist me, and hast loued hem, as thou hast loued also me.
Fadir, thei whiche thou yauest to me, Y wole that where Y am, that thei be with me, that thei see my clerenesse, that thou hast youun to me; for thou louedist me bifor the makyng of the world.
Fadir, riytfuli the world knew thee not, but Y knew thee, and these knewen, that thou sentist me.
And Y haue maad thi name knowun to hem, and schal make knowun; that the loue bi which thou `hast loued me, be in hem, and Y in hem.

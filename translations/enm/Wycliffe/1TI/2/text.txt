Therfor Y biseche first of alle thingis, that bisechingis, preieris, axyngis, doyngis of thankyngis, ben maad for alle men,
for kingis and alle that ben set in hiynesse, that we leden a quyet and a pesible lijf, in al pite and chastite.
For this thing is good and acceptid bifor God,
oure sauyour, that wole that alle men ben maad saaf, and that thei come to the knowyng of treuthe.
For o God and a mediatour is of God and of men, a man Crist Jhesus,
that yaf him silf redempcioun for alle men. Whos witnessing is confermyd in his tymes;
in which Y am set a prechour and an apostle. For Y seye treuthe, and Y lie not, that am a techere of hethene men in feith and in treuthe.
Therfor Y wole, that men preye in al place, liftinge vp clene hondis with outen wraththe and strijf.
Also wymmen in couenable abite, with schamefastnesse and sobrenesse araiynge hem silf, not in writhun heeris, ethir in gold, ethir peerlis, ethir preciouse cloth; but that that bicometh wymmen,
biheetinge pite bi good werkis.
A womman lerne in silence, with al subieccioun.
But Y suffre not a womman to teche, nether to haue lordschip on the hosebonde, but to be in silence.
For Adam was first formed, aftirward Eue;
and Adam was not disseyued, but the womman was disseyued, in breking of the lawe.
But sche schal be sauyd bi generacioun of children, if sche dwellith perfitli in feith, and loue, and hoolynesse, with sobrenesse.

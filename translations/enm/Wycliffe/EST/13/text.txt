Whanne Y was lord of ful many folkis, and Y hadde maad suget al the world to my lordschip, Y wolde not mysuse the greetnesse of power, but gouerne sugetis bi merci and softnesse, that thei, ledynge lijf in silence with outen ony drede, schulden vse pees couetid of alle deedli men.
Sotheli whanne Y axide of my counselours, hou this myyte be fillid, oon, Aaman bi name, that passide othere men in wisdom and `feithfulnesse, and was the secounde aftir the kyng,

Forsothe Mardochee bisouyte the Lord, and was myndeful of alle `hise werkys, and seide,

And al Israel with lijk mynde and bisechyng criede to the Lord, for certeyn deeth neiyede to hem.

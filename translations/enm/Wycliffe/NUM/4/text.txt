And the Lord spak to Moises and to Aaron,

bi her housis and meynees, fro the threttithe yeer and aboue `til to the fiftithe yeer, of alle that entren, that thei stonde and mynystre in the tabernacle of boond of pees.
This is the religioun of the sones of Caath; Aaron and his sones schulen entren in to the tabernacle of boond of pees, and in to the hooli of hooli thingis,
whanne the tentis schulen be moued; and thei schulen do doun the veil that hangith bifore the yatis, and thei schulen wlappe in it the arke of witnessyng;

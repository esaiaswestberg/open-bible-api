Therfor if ye han risun togidere with Crist, seke ye tho thingis that ben aboue, where Crist is sittynge in the riythalf of God.
Sauere ye tho thingis, that ben aboue, not tho that ben on the erthe.
For ye ben deed, and youre lijf is hid with Crist in God.
For whanne Crist schal appere, youre lijf, thanne also ye schulen appere with hym in glorie.
Therfor sle ye youre membris, whiche ben on the erthe, fornycacioun, vnclennesse, letcherie, yuel coueitise, and aueryse, which is seruyse of mawmetis;
for whiche thingis the wraththe of God cam on the sones of vnbileue;
in whiche also ye walkiden sum tyme, whanne ye lyueden in hem.
But now putte ye awei alle thingis, wraththe, indignacioun, malice, blasfemye and foule word of youre mouth.
Nyle ye lie togidere; spuyle ye you fro the elde man with his dedes, and clothe ye the newe man,
that is maad newe ayen in to the knowing of God, aftir the ymage of hym that made hym;
where is not male and female, hethene man and Jew, circumcisioun and prepucie, barbarus and Scita, bonde man and fre man, but alle thingis and in alle thingis Crist.
Therfor ye, as the chosun of God, hooli and louyd, clothe you with the entrailis of merci, benygnite, and mekenesse, temperaunce, pacience;
and support ye echon other, and foryyue to you silf, if ony man ayens ony hath a querele; as the Lord foryaf to you, so also ye.
And vpon alle these thingis haue ye charite, that is the boond of perfeccioun.
And the pees of Crist enioye in youre hertis, in which ye ben clepid in o bodi, and be ye kynde.
The word of Crist dwelle in you plenteuousli, in al wisdom; and teche and moneste you silf in salmes, and ympnes, and spiritual songis, in grace synginge in youre hertis to the Lord.
Al thing, what euere thing ye don, in word or in dede, alle thingis in the name of oure Lord Jhesu Crist, doynge thankyngis to God and to the fadir bi hym.
Wymmen, be ye sugetis to youre hosebondis, as it bihoueth in the Lord.
Men, loue ye youre wyues, and nyle ye be bittere to hem.
Sones, obeie ye to youre fadir and modir bi alle thingis; for this is wel plesinge in the Lord.
Fadris, nyle ye terre youre sones to indignacioun, that thei be not maad feble hertid.
Seruauntis, obeie ye bi alle thingis to fleischli lordis, not seruynge at iye, as plesynge to men, but in symplenesse of herte, dredinge the Lord.
What euer ye doen, worche ye of wille, as to the Lord and not to men;
witinge that of the Lord ye schulen take yelding of eritage. Serue ye to the Lord Crist.
For he that doith iniurie, schal resseyue that that he dide yuele; and acceptacioun of persoones is not anentis God.

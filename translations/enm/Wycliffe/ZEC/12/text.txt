The birthun of the word of the Lord on Israel. And the Lord seide, stretchynge forth heuene, and founding erthe, and makynge the spirit of a man in hym, Lo!
Y schal putte Jerusalem a lyntel of glotonye to alle puplis in cumpas, but and Juda schal be in `a segyng ayens Jerusalem.
And it schal be, in that dai Y schal putte Jerusalem a stoon of birthun to alle puplis; alle that schulen lifte it, schulen be to-drawun with kittyng doun, and alle rewmes of erthe schulen be gaderid ayens it.
In that dai, seith the Lord, Y schal smyte ech hors in drede, `ether leesynge of mynde, and the stiere `of hym in woodnesse; and on the hous of Juda Y schal opene myn iyen, and schal smyte with blyndnesse ech hors of puplis.
And duikis of Juda schulen seie in her hertis, Be the dwellers of Jerusalem coumfortid to me in the Lord of oostis, the God of hem.
In that dai Y schal putte the duykis of Juda as a chymnei of fier in trees, and as a broond of fier in hei; and thei schulen deuoure at the `riythalf and lefthalf alle puplis in cumpas. And Jerusalem schal be enhabitid eftsoone in his place, `in Jerusalem.
And the Lord schal saue the tabernaclis of Juda, as in bigynnyng, that the hous of Dauid `glorie not greetli, and the glorie of men dwellynge in Jerusalem be not ayens Juda.
In that dai the Lord schal defende the dwelleris of Jerusalem; and he that schal offende of hem, schal be in that dai as Dauid, and the hous of Dauid schal be as of God, as the aungel of the Lord in the siyt of hym.
And it schal be, in that dai Y schal seke for to al to-breke alle folkis that comen ayens Jerusalem.
And Y schal helde out on the hous of Dauid, and on dwelleris of Jerusalem, the spirit of grace, and of preieris; and thei schulen biholde to me, whom thei `fitchiden togidere. And thei schulen biweile hym with weilyng, as on `the oon bigetun; and thei schulen sorewe on hym, as it is wont `for to be sorewid in the deth of the firste bigetun.
In that dai greet weilyng schal be in Jerusalem, as the weilyng of Adremon in the feeld of Magedon.
And erthe schal weile; meynees and meynees bi hem silf; the meynees of the hous of Dauid bi hem silf, and the wymmen of hem bi hem silf;
meynees of the hous of Nathan bi hem silf, and the wymmen of hem bi hem silf; meynees of the hous of Leuy bi hem silf, and the wymmen of hem bi hem silf; meynees of Semei bi hem silf, and the wymmen of hem bi hem silf.
All othere meynees, meynees and meynees bi hem silf, and the wymmen of hem bi hem silf.

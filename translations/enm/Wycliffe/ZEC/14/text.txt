Lo! daies comen, seith the Lord, and thi spuylis schulen be departid in the myddil of thee.
And Y schal gadere alle folkis to Jerusalem, in to batel; and the citee schal be takun, and housis schulen be distried, and wymmen schulen be defoulid. And the myddil part of the citee schal go out in to caitiftee, and the `tother part of the puple schal not be takun awei fro the citee.
And the Lord schal go out, and schal fiyte ayens tho folkis, as he fauyte in the dai of strijf.
And hise feet schulen stonde in that dai on the hil of olyues, that is ayens Jerusalem at the eest. And the hil of olyues schal be coruun of the myddil part therof to the eest and to the west, bi ful greet biforbrekyng; and the myddil of the hil schal be departid to the north, and the myddil therof to the south.
And ye schulen fle to the valei of myn hillis, for the valei of hillis schal be ioyned togidere til to the nexte. And ye schulen fle, as ye fledden fro the face of erthe mouyng in the daies of Osie, kyng of Juda; and my Lord God schal come, and alle seyntis with hym.
And it schal be, in that dai liyt schal not be, but coold and frost.
And `ther schal be o dai, which is knowun to the Lord, not day, nether niyt, and in tyme of euentid liyt schal be.
And it schal be, in that dai quyke watris schulen go out of Jerusalem, the myddil of hem schal go out to the eest see, and the myddil of hem to the laste see; in somer and in wynter thei schulen be.
And the Lord schal be kyng on al erthe; in that dai there schal be o Lord, and his name schal be oon.
And al erthe schal turne ayen til to desert, fro the litil hil Remmon to the south of Jerusalem. And it schal be reisid, and schal dwelle in his place, fro the yate of Beniamyn til to place of the formere yate, and til to the yate of the corneris, and fro the tour of Ananyel til to the pressouris of the kyng.
And thei schulen dwelle there ynne, and cursidnesse schal no more be, but Jerusalem schal sitte sikir.
And this schal be the wounde, bi which the Lord schal smyte alle folkis, that fouyten ayens Jerusalem; the fleisch of ech man stondynge on hise feet schal faile, and hise iyen schulen faile togidere in her hoolis, and her tunge schal faile togidere in her mouth.
In that dai greet noise of the Lord schal be in hem, and a man schal catche the hond of his neiybore; and his hond schal be lockid togidere on hond of his neiybore.
But and Judas schal fiyte ayens Jerusalem; and richessis of alle folkis in cumpas schulen be gaderide togidere, gold, and siluer, and many clothis ynow.
And so fallyng schal be of hors, and mule, and camel, and asse, and of alle werk beestis, that weren in tho castels, as this fallyng.
And alle that schulen be residue of alle folkis, that camen ayens Jerusalem, schulen stie vp fro yeer in to yeer, that thei worschipe the kyng, Lord of oostis, and halewe the feeste of tabernaclis.
And it schal be, reyn schal not be on hem that schulen not stie vp of the meyneis of erthe to Jerusalem, `that thei worschipe the king, Lord of oostis.
`That and if the meynee of Egipt schal not stie vp, and schal not come, nether on hem schal be reyn; but fallyng schal be, bi which the Lord schal smyte alle folkis, whiche stieden not, for to halewe the feeste of tabernaclis.
This schal be the synne of Egipt, and this the synne of alle folkis, that stieden not, for to halewe the feeste of tabernaclis.
In that dai, that that is on the bridil of hors schal be hooli to the Lord; and caudruns schulen be in the hous of the Lord, as cruetis bifor the auter.
And euery caudrun in Jerusalem and Juda schal be halewid to the Lord of oostis. And alle men schulen come offrynge, and schulen take of tho, and schulen sethe in tho; and a marchaunt schal no more be in the hous of the Lord of oostis in that day.

Therfor thou, my sone, be coumfortid in grace that is in Crist Jhesu.
And what thingis thou hast herd of me bi many witnessis, bitake thou these to feithful men, whiche schulen `be also able to teche othere men.
Trauele thou as a good knyyt of Crist Jhesu.
No man holdinge knyythod to God, wlappith hym silf with worldli nedis, that he plese to hym, to whom he hath preuyd hym silf.
For he that fiytith in a batel, schal not be corowned, but he fiyte lawfuli.
It bihoueth an erthetiliere to resseyue first of the fruytis.
Vndurstonde thou what thingis Y seie. For the Lord schal yyue to thee vndurstonding in alle thingis.
Be thou myndeful that the Lord Jhesu Crist of the seed of Dauid hath rise ayen fro deth,
aftir my gospel, in which Y trauele `til to boondis, as worching yuele, but the word of God is not boundun.
Therfor Y suffre alle thingis for the chosun, that also thei gete the heelthe, that is in Crist Jhesu, with heuenli glorie.
A trewe word, that if we ben deed togidere, also we schulen liue togidere;
if we suffren, we schulen regne togidere; if we denyen, he schal denye vs;
if we bileuen not, he dwellith feithful, he mai not denye hym silf.
Teche thou these thingis, witnessinge bifore God. Nyle thou stryue in wordis; for to no thing it is profitable, but to the subuerting of men that heren.
Bisili kepe to yyue thi silf a preued preisable werkman to God, with oute schame, riytli tretinge the word of treuthe.
But eschewe thou vnhooli and veyn spechis, for whi tho profiten myche to vnfeithfulnesse,
and the word of hem crepith as a canker. Of whiche Filete is, and Ymeneus,
whiche felden doun fro the treuthe, seiynge that the rising ayen is now doon, and thei subuertiden the feith of summen.
But the sad foundement of God stondith, hauynge this marke, The Lord knowith whiche ben hise, and, Ech man that nameth the name of the Lord, departith fro wickidnesse.
But in a greet hous ben not oneli vessels of gold and of siluer, but also of tree and of erthe; and so summen ben in to onour, and summe in to dispit.
Therfor if ony man clensith hym silf fro these, he schal be a vessel halewid in to onour, and profitable to the Lord, redi to al good werk.
And fle thou desiris of yongthe, but sue thou riytwisnesse, feith, charite, pees, with hem that inwardli clepen the Lord of a clene herte.
And eschewe thou foltische questiouns, and without kunnyng, wytynge that tho gendren chidyngis.
But it bihoueth the seruaunt of the Lord to chide not; but to be mylde to alle men, able to teche,
paciente, with temperaunce repreuynge hem that ayenstonden the treuthe, that sum tyme God yyue to hem forthenkyng, that thei knowen the treuthe,
and that thei rise ayen fro the snares of the deuel, of whom thei ben holdun prisoneris at his wille.

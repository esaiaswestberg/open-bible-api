I witnesse bifore God and Crist Jhesu, that schal deme the quike and the deed, and bi the comyng of hym, and the kyngdom of hym,
preche the word, be thou bisi couenabli with outen rest, repreue thou, biseche thou, blame thou in al pacience and doctryn.
For tyme schal be, whanne men schulen not suffre hoolsum teching, but at her desiris thei schulen gadere `togidere to hem silf maistris yitchinge to the eeris.
And treuli thei schulen turne awei the heryng fro treuthe, but to fablis thei schulen turne.
But wake thou, in alle thingis traueile thou, do the werk of an euangelist, fulfille thi seruyce, be thou sobre.
For Y am sacrifisid now, and the tyme of my departyng is nyy.
Y haue stryuun a good strijf, Y haue endid the cours, Y haue kept the feith.
In `the tothir tyme a coroun of riytwisnesse is kept to me, which the Lord, a iust domesman, schal yelde to me in that dai; and not oneli to me, but also to these that louen his comyng.
Hyye thou to come to me soone. For Demas, louynge this world, hath forsakun me, and wente to Tessalonyk,
Crescens in to Galathi, Tite in to Dalmacie;
Luk aloone is with me. Take thou Mark, and brynge with thee; for he is profitable to me in to seruyce.
Forsothe Y sente Titicus to Effesi.
The cloth which Y lefte at Troade at Carpe, whanne thou comest, bringe with thee, and the bookis, but moost parchemyne.
Alisaundre, the tresorer, schewide to me myche yuele; `the Lord schal yelde to hym aftir his werkis.
Whom also thou eschewe; for he ayenstood ful greetli oure wordis.
In my firste defence no man helpide me, but alle forsoken me; be it not arettid to hem.
But the Lord helpide me, and coumfortide me, that the preching be fillid bi me, and that alle folkis here, that Y am delyueride fro the mouth of the lioun.
And the Lord delyueride me fro al yuel werk, and schal make me saaf in to his heuenly kingdom, to whom be glorie in to worldis of worldis.
Amen. Grete wel Prisca, and Aquila, and the hous of Oneseforus.
Erastus lefte at Corynthi, and Y lefte Trofymus sijk at Mylete.
Hiye thou to come bifore wyntir. Eubolus, and Prudent, and Lynus, and Claudia, and alle britheren, greten thee wel.
Oure Lord Jhesu Crist be with thi spirit. The grace of God be with you. Amen.

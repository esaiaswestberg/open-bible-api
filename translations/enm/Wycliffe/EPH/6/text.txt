Sones, obeische ye to youre fadir and modir, in the Lord; for this thing is riytful.
Onoure thou thi fadir and thi modir, that is the firste maundement in biheest;
that it be wel to thee, and that thou be long lyuynge on the erthe.
And, fadris, nyle ye terre youre sones to wraththe; but nurische ye hem in the teching and chastising of the Lord.
Seruauntis, obeische ye to fleischli lordis with drede and trembling, in simplenesse of youre herte, as to Crist;
not seruynge at the iye, as plesinge to men, but as seruauntis of Crist; doynge the wille of God bi discrecioun,
with good wille seruynge as to the Lord, and not as to men;
witinge that ech man, what euere good thing he schal do, he schal resseyue this of the Lord, whether seruaunt, whether fre man.
And, ye lordis, do the same thingis to hem, foryyuynge manaasis; witinge that bothe her Lord and youre is in heuenes, and the taking of persones is not anentis God.
Her aftirward, britheren, be ye coumfortid in the Lord, and in the miyt of his vertu.
Clothe you with the armere of God, that ye moun stonde ayens aspiynges of the deuel.
For whi stryuyng is not to vs ayens fleisch and blood, but ayens princis and potestatis, ayens gouernours of the world of these derknessis, ayens spiritual thingis of wickidnesse, in heuenli thingis.
Therfor take ye the armere of God, that ye moun ayenstonde in the yuel dai; and in alle thingis stonde perfit.
Therfor stonde ye, and be gird aboute youre leendis in sothefastnesse, and clothid with the haburioun of riytwisnesse,
and youre feet schood in making redi of the gospel of pees.
In alle thingis take ye the scheld of feith, in which ye moun quenche alle the firy dartis of `the worste.
And take ye the helm of helthe, and the swerd of the Goost, that is, the word of God.
Bi al preier and bisechyng preie ye al tyme in spirit, and in hym wakinge in al bisynesse, and bisechyng for alle hooli men, and for me;
that word be youun to me in openyng of my mouth, with trist to make knowun the mysterie of the gospel,
for which Y am set in message in a chayne; so that in it Y be hardi to speke, as it bihoueth me.
And ye wite, what thingis ben aboute me, what Y do, Titicus, my moost dere brother, and trewe mynystre in the Lord, schal make alle thingis knowun to you;
whom Y sente to you for this same thing, that ye knowe what thingis ben aboute vs, and that he coumforte youre hertis.
Pees to britheren, and charite, with feith of God oure fadir, and of the Lord Jhesu Crist.
Grace with alle men that louen oure Lord Jhesu Crist in vncorrupcioun. Amen, `that is, So be it.

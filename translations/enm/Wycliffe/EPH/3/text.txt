For the grace of this thing I Poul, the boundun of Crist Jhesu, for you hethene men,

For bi reuelacioun the sacrament is maad knowun to me, as Y aboue wroot in schort thing,
as ye moun rede, and vndurstonde my prudence in the mysterie of Crist.
Which was not knowun to othere generaciouns to the sones of men, as it is now schewid to his hooli apostlis and prophetis in the spirit,
that hethene men ben euen eiris, and of oo bodi, and parteneris togidere of his biheest in Crist Jhesu bi the euangelie;
whos mynystre Y am maad, bi the yifte of Goddis grace, which is youun to me bi the worchyng of his vertu.
To me, leeste of alle seyntis, this grace is youun to preche among hethene men the vnserchable richessis of Crist, and to liytne alle men,
which is the dispensacioun of sacrament hid fro worldis in God, that made alle thingis of nouyt;
that the myche fold wisdom of God be knowun to princis and potestatis in heuenli thingis bi the chirche,
bi the bifore ordinaunce of worldis, which he made in Crist Jhesu oure Lord.
In whom we han trist and nyy comyng, in tristenyng bi the feith of hym.
For which thing Y axe, that ye faile not in my tribulaciouns for you, which is youre glorie.
For grace of this thing Y bowe my knees to the fadir of oure Lord Jhesu Crist,
of whom ech fadirhod in heuenes and in erthe is named,
that he yyue to you, aftir the richessis of his glorie, vertu to be strengthid bi his spirit in the ynnere man,
that Crist dwelle bi feith in youre hertis; that ye rootid and groundid in charite,
moun comprehende with alle seyntis, which is the breede, and the lengthe, and the hiynesse, and the depnesse;
also to wite the charite of Crist more excellent than science, that ye be fillid in al the plentee of God.
And to hym that is myyti to do alle thingis more plenteuousli than we axen or vndurstondun, bi the vertu that worchith in vs,
to hym be glorie in the chirche, and in Crist Jhesu, in to alle the generaciouns of the world of worldis. Amen.

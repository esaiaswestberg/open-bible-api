Poul, clepid apostle of Jhesu Crist, bi the wille of God, and Sostenes, brothir, to the chirche of God that is at Corynthe,
to hem that ben halewid in Crist Jhesu, and clepid seyntis, with alle that inwardli clepen the name of oure Lord Jhesu Crist, in ech place of hem and of oure,
grace to you and pees of God, oure fadir, and of the Lord Jhesu Crist.
Y do thankyngis to my God eueremore for you, in the grace of God that is youun to you in Crist Jhesu.
For in alle thingis ye ben maad riche in hym, in ech word, and in ech kunnyng,
as the witnessyng of Crist is confermyd in you;
so that no thing faile to you in ony grace, that abiden the schewyng of oure Lord Jhesu Crist;
which also schal conferme you in to the ende with outen cryme, in the dai of the comyng of oure Lord Jhesu Crist.
`A trewe God, bi whom ye ben clepid in to the felouschipe of his sone Jhesu Crist oure Lord.
But, britheren, Y biseche you, bi the name of oure Lord Jhesu Crist, that ye alle seie the same thing, and that dissenciouns be not among you; but be ye perfit in the same wit, and in the same kunnyng.
For, my britheren, it is teld to me of hem that ben at Cloes, that stryues ben among you.
And Y seie that, that ech of you seith, For Y am of Poul, and Y am of Apollo, and Y am of Cefas, but Y am of Crist.
Whether Crist is departid? whether Poul was crucified for you, ether ye ben baptisid in the name of Poul?
Y do thankyngis to my God, that Y baptiside noon of you, but Crispus and Gayus;
lest ony man seie, that ye ben baptisid in my name.
And Y baptiside also the hous of Stephan, but Y woot not, that Y baptiside ony other.
For Crist sente me not to baptise, but to preche the gospel; not in wisdom of word, that the cros of Crist be not voidid awei.
For the word of the cros is foli to hem that perischen; but to hem that ben maad saaf, that is to seie, to vs, it is the vertu of God.
For it is writun, Y schal distruye the wisdom of wise men, and Y schal reproue the prudence of prudent men.
Where is the wise man? where is the wise lawiere? where is the purchasour of this world? Whether God hath not maad the wisdom of this world fonned?
For the world in wisdom of God knewe not God bi wisdom, it pleside to God, bi foli of prechyng, `to maken hem saaf that bileueden.
For Jewis seken signes, and Grekis seken wisdom;
but we prechen Crist crucified, to Jewis sclaundre, and to hethene men foli;
but to tho Jewis and Grekis that ben clepid, we prechen Crist the vertu of God and the wisdom of God.
For that that is foli thing of God, is wiser than men; and that that is the feble thing of God, is strengere than men.
But, britheren, se ye youre clepyng; for not many wise men aftir the fleisch, not many myyti, not many noble.
But God chees tho thingis that ben fonned of the world, to confounde wise men;
and God chees the feble thingis of the world, to confounde the stronge thingis; and God chees the vnnoble thingis `and dispisable thingis of the world, and tho thingis that ben not, to distruye tho thingis that ben;
that ech man haue not glorie in his siyt.
But of hym ye ben in Crist Jhesu, which is maad of God to vs wisdom, and riytwisnesse, and holynesse, and ayenbiyng; that,
as it is wrytun, He that glorieth, haue glorie in the Lord.

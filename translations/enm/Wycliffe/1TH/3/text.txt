For which thing we suffriden no lengere, and it pleside to vs to dwelle aloone at Atenys;
and we senten Tymothe, oure brother, and mynystre of God in the euangelie of Crist, to you to be confermyd, and to be tauyt for youre feith,
that no man be mouyd in these tribulaciouns. For ye silf witen, that in this this thing we ben set.
For whanne we weren at you, we biforseiden to you, that we schulden suffre tribulaciouns; as it is don, and ye witen.
Therfor Y Poul, no lenger abidinge, sente to knowe youre feith, lest perauenture he that temptith tempte you, and youre trauel be maad veyn.
But now, whanne Tymothe schal come to vs fro you, and telle to vs youre feith and charite, and that ye han good mynde of vs, euere desyringe to se vs, as we also you;
therfor, britheren, we ben coumfortid in you, in al oure nede and tribulacioun, bi youre feith.
For now we lyuen, if ye stonden in the Lord.
For what doyng of thankingis moun we yelde to God for you, in al ioye, in which we ioyen for you bifor oure Lord?
nyyt and dai more plenteuousli preiynge, that we se youre face, and fulfille tho thingis that failen to youre feith.
But God hym silf and oure fadir, and the Lord Jhesu Crist, dresse oure weye to you.
And the Lord multiplie you, and make youre charite to be plenteuouse of ech to othere, and in to alle men, as also we in you;
that youre hertis ben confermyd with outen pleynt in holynesse, bifor God and oure fadir, in the comyng of oure Lord Jhesu Crist with alle hise seyntis. Amen.

The Lord seith these thingis to my crist, Cirus, whos riythond Y took, that Y make suget folkis bifor his face, and turne the backis of kyngis; and Y schal opene yatis bifore hym, and yatis schulen not be closid.
Y schal go bifore thee, and Y schal make lowe the gloriouse men of erthe; Y schal al to-breke brasun yatis, and Y schal breke togidere irun barris.
And Y schal yyue hid tresours to thee, and the priuy thingis of priuytees, that thou wite, that Y am the Lord, that clepe thi name, God of Israel,
for my seruaunt Jacob, and Israel my chosun, and Y clepide thee bi thi name; Y licnyde thee, and thou knewist not me.
Y am the Lord, and ther is no more; with out me is no God. Y haue gird thee, and thou knewist not me.
That thei that ben at the risyng of the sunne, and thei that ben at the west, know, that with out me is no God.
Y am the Lord, and noon other God is; fourmynge liyt, and makynge derknessis, makynge pees, and fourmynge yuel; Y am the Lord, doynge alle these thingis.
Heuenes, sende ye out deew fro aboue, and cloudis, reyne a iust man; the erthe be openyde, and brynge forth the sauyour, and riytfulnesse be borun togidere; Y the Lord haue maad hym of nouyt.
Wo to hym that ayen seith his maker, a tiel stoon of erthe of Sannys. Whether clei seith to his pottere, What makist thou, and thi werk is withouten hondis?
Wo to hym that seith to the fadir, What gendrist thou? and to a womman, What childist thou?
The Lord, the hooli of Israel, the fourmere therof, seith these thingis, Axe ye me thingis to comynge on my sones, and sende ye to me on the werkis of myn hondis.
Y made erthe, and Y made a man on it; myn hondis helden abrood heuenes, and Y comaundide to al the knyythod of tho.
Y reiside hym to riytfulnesse, and Y schal dresse alle hise weies; he schal bilde my citee, and he schal delyuere my prisoneris, not in prijs, nether in yiftis, seith the Lord of oostis.
The Lord God seith these thingis, The trauel of Egipt, and the marchaundie of Ethiopie, and of Sabaym; hiy men schulen go to thee, and schulen be thine; thei schulen go aftir thee, thei schulen go boundun in manyclis, and schulen worschipe thee, and schulen biseche thee. God is oneli in thee, and with out thee is no God.
Verili thou art God hid, God, the sauyour of Israel.
Alle makeris of errours ben schent, and weren aschamed; thei yeden togidere in to confusioun.
Israel is sauyde in the Lord, bi euerlastynge helthe; ye schulen not be schent, and ye schulen not be aschamed, til in to the world of world.
For whi the Lord makynge heuenes of nouyt, seith these thingis; he is God fourmynge erthe, and makinge it, he is the makere therof; he made it of noyt, not in veyn, but he formyde it, that it be enhabitid; Y am the Lord, and noon other is.
Y spak not in hid place, not in a derk place of erthe; I seide not to the seed of Jacob, Seke ye me in veyn. Y am the Lord spekynge riytfulnesse, tellynge riytful thingis.
Be ye gaderid, and come ye, and neiye ye togidere, that ben sauyd of hethene men; thei that reisen a signe of her grauyng, knewen not, and thei preien a god that saueth not.
Telle ye, and come ye, and take ye councel togidere. Who made this herd fro the bigynnyng? fro that tyme Y bifor seide it. Whether Y am not the Lord, and no God is ferthere with out me? God riytful and sauynge is noon, outakun me.
Alle the coostis of erthe, be ye conuertid to me, and ye schulen be saaf; for Y am the Lord, and noon other is.
Y swoor in my silf, a word of riytfulnesse schal go out of my mouth, and it schal not turne ayen;
for ech kne schal be bowid to me, and ech tunge schal swere.
Therfor thei schulen sei in the Lord, Riytfulnessis and empire ben myne; alle that fiyten ayens hym schulen come to hym, and schulen be aschamed.
Al the seed of Israel schal be iustified and preysid in the Lord.

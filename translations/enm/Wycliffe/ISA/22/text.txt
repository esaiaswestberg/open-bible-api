The birthun of the valei of visioun. What also is to thee, for and al thou stiedist in to roouys,
thou ful of cry, a citee of myche puple, a citee ful out ioiynge? thi slayn men weren not slayn bi swerd, nether thi deed men weren deed in batel.
Alle thi princes fledden togidere, and weren boundun harde; alle that weren foundun, weren boundun togidere, thei fledden fer.
Therfor Y seide, Go ye awei fro me, Y schal wepe bittirli; nyle ye be bisie to coumforte me on the distriyng of the douyter of my puple.
For whi a dai of sleyng, and of defoulyng, and of wepyngis, is ordeined of the Lord God of oostis, in the valei of visioun; and he serchith the walle, and is worschipful on the hil.
And Helam took an arowe caas, and the chare of an horse man; and the scheeld made nakid the wal.
And thi chosun valeis, Jerusalem, schulen be ful of cartis; and knyytis schulen putte her seetis in the yate.
And the hilyng of Juda schal be schewid; and thou schalt se in that dai the place of armuris of the hous of the forest;
and ye schulen se the crasyngis of the citee of Dauid, for tho ben multiplied. Ye gaderiden togidere the watris of the lowere cisterne,
and ye noumbriden the housis of Jerusalem, and ye distrieden housis, to make strong the wal; and ye maden a lake bitwixe twei wallis,
and ye restoriden the watir of the elde sisterne; and ye biholden not to hym, that made `thilke Jerusalem, and ye sien not the worchere therof afer.
And the Lord God of oostis schal clepe in that dai to wepyng, and to morenyng, and to ballidnesse, and to a girdil of sak; and lo!
ioie and gladnesse is to sle caluys, and to strangle wetheris, to ete fleisch, and to drynke wyn; ete we, and drynke we, for we schulen die to morewe.
And the vois of the Lord of oostis is schewid in myn eeris, This wickidnesse schal not be foryouun to you, til ye dien, seith the Lord God of oostis.
The Lord God of oostis seith these thingis, Go thou, and entre to hym that dwellith in the tabernacle, to Sobna, the souereyn of the temple; and thou schalt seie to hym,
What thou here, ethir as who here? for thou hast hewe to thee a sepulcre here, thou hast hewe a memorial in hiy place diligentli, a tabernacle in a stoon to thee.
Lo! the Lord schal make thee to be borun out, as a kapoun is borun out, and as a cloth, so he shal reise thee.
He crowninge schal crowne thee with tribulacioun; he schal sende thee as a bal in to a large lond and wijd; there thou schalt die, and there schal be the chare of thi glorie, and the schenschipe of the hous of thi Lord.
And Y schal caste thee out of thi stondyng, and Y schal putte thee doun of thi seruyce.
And it schal be, in that dai Y schal clepe my seruaunt Eliachim, the sone of Helchie; and Y schal clothe hym in thi coote,
and Y schal coumforte hym with thi girdil, and Y shal yyue thi power in to the hondis of hym; and he schal be as a fadir to hem that dwellen in Jerusalem, and to the hous of Juda.
And Y schal yyue the keie of the hous of Dauyd on his schuldre; and he schal opene, and noon schal be that schal schitte; and he schal schitte, and noon schal be that schal opene.
And Y schal sette hym a stake in a feithful place, and he schal be in to the seete of glorie of the hous of his fadir.
And thou schalt hange on hym al the glorie of the hous of his fadir, diuerse kindis of vessels, eche litil vessel, fro the vesselis of cuppis `til to ech vessel of musikis.
In that dai, seith the Lord of oostis, the stake that was set in the feithful place, schal be takun awei, and it schal be brokun, and schal falle doun; and schal perische that hangide therynne, for the Lord spak.

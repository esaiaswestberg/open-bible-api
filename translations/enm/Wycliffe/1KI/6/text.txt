Forsothe it was doon in the fourthe hundrid and fourescore yeer of the goynge out of the sones of Israel fro the lond of Egipt, in the fourthe yeer, in the monethe Zio; thilke is the secounde monethe of the rewme of Salomon on Israel; he bigan to bilde an hows to the Lord.
Forsothe the hows which kyng Salomon bildide to the Lord, hadde sexti cubitis in lengthe, and twenti cubitis in breede, and thretti cubitis in heiythe.
And a porche was bifor the temple of twenti cubitis of lengthe, by the mesure of the breed of the temple; and the porche hadde ten cubitis of breede, bifor the face of the temple.
And Salomon made in the temple `wyndows streyte withoutforth, and large with ynne.
And he bildide on the wal of the temple bildyngis of tablis bi cumpas, in the wallis of the hows, `bi cumpas of the temple, and of Goddis answeryng place; and he made sidis in the cumpas.
The bildyng of tablis, that was vndur, hadde fyue cubitis of breede; and the myddil bildyng of tablis was of sixe cubits of breede; and the thridde bildyng of tablis was hauynge seuene cubitis of breede. Sotheli he puttide beemys in the hous bi cumpas with outforth, that tho cleuiden not to the wallis of the temple.
Forsothe whanne the hows was bildid, it was bildid of `stoonys hewid and perfit; and an hamer, and ax, and al thing maad of yrun, weren not herd in the hows, while it was in bildyng.
The dore of the myddil side was in the wal of the riythalf hows; and bi a vijs thei stieden in to the myddil soler, and fro the myddil soler in to the thridde soler.
And Salomon bildide the hows, and endide it. Also Salomon hilide the hows with couplis of cedre,
and bildide a bildyng of tablis ouer al the hows, bi fyue cubitis of heiythe, and hilide the hows with `trees of cedre.
And the word of the Lord was maad to Salomon, and seide,
This is the hows, which thou bildist; if thou gost in myn heestis, and dost my domes, and kepist alle my comaundementis, and goist bi tho, Y schal make stidefast my word to thee, `which word Y spak to Dauid, thi fadir;
and Y schal dwelle in the myddis of the sones of Israel, and Y schal not forsake my puple Israel.
Therfor Salomon bildide the hows, and endide it;
and he bildide the wallis of the hows with ynne with tablis of cedre, fro the pawment of the hows `til to the heiynesse of the wal, and `til to the couplis; and hilide with trees of cedre with ynne; and he hilide the pawment of the hows with tablis of beeche.
And he bildide a wal of tablis of cedre of twenti cubitis at the hyndrere part of the temple, fro the pawment `til to the hiyere partis; and he made the ynnere hows of Goddis answeryng place, in to the hooli of hooli thingis.

No thing was in the temple, `which thing was not hilid with gold; but also he hilid with gold al the auter of Goddis answeryng place.
And he made in `Goddis answeryng place twey cherubyns of the trees of olyues, of ten cubits of heiyte;
o wynge of cherub was of fyue cubitis, and the tother wynge of cherub was of fyue cubitis, that is, hauynge ten cubitis, fro the heiynesse of `the o wynge `til to the hiynesse of the tother wynge.
And the secunde cherub was of ten cubitis in euene mesure; and o werk was in the twey cherubyns,

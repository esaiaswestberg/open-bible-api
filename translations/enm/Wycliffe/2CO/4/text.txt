Therfor we that han this admynystracioun, aftir this that we han getun merci,
faile we not, but do we awei the preue thingis of schame, not walkinge in sutil gile, nether doynge auoutrye bi the word of God, but in schewynge of the treuthe comendynge vs silf to ech conscience of men bifor God.
For if also oure gospel is kyuerid, in these that perischen it is kyuerid;
in which God hath blent the soulis of vnfeithful men of this world, that the liytnyng of the gospel of the glorie of Crist, which is the ymage of God, schyne not.
But we prechen not vs silf, but oure Lord Jhesu Crist; and vs youre seruauntis bi Jhesu.
For God, that seide liyt to schyne of derknessis, he hath youe liyt in oure hertis, to the liytnyng of the science of the clerenesse of God, in the face of Jhesu Crist.
And we han this tresour in britil vessels, that the worthinesse be of Goddis vertu, and not of vs.
In alle thingis we suffren tribulacioun, but we ben not angwischid, or annoyed; we ben maad pore, but `we lacken nothing; we suffren persecucioun,
but we ben not forsakun; we ben maad lowe, but we ben not confoundid; we ben cast doun, but we perischen not.
And euere more we beren aboute the sleyng of Jhesu in oure bodi, that also the lijf of Jhesu be schewid in oure bodies.
For euere more we that lyuen, ben takun in to deth for Jhesu, that the lijf of Jhesu be schewid in oure deedli fleisch.
Therfor deth worchith in vs, but lijf worchith in you.
And we han the same spirit of feith, as it is writun, Y haue bileuyd, Y haue spoke; and we bileuen, wherfor also we speken;
witynge that he that reiside Jhesu, schal reise also vs with Jhesu, and schal ordeyne with you.
And alle thingis for you, that a plenteuouse grace bi many thankyngis be plenteuouse in to the glorie of God.
For which thing we failen not, for thouy oure vtter man be corruptid; netheles the ynner man is renewid fro dai to dai.
But that liyt thing of oure tribulacioun that lastith now, but as it were by a moment, worchith in vs ouer mesure an euerlastynge birthin in to the heiynesse of glorie;
while that we biholden not tho thingis that ben seyn, but tho that ben not seyn. For tho thingis that ben seyn, ben but durynge for a schort tyme; but tho thingis that ben not seyn, ben euerlastynge.

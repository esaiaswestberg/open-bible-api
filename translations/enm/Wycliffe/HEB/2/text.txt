Therfor more plenteuousli it bihoueth vs to kepe tho thingis, that we han herd, lest perauenture we fleten awei.
For if the ilke word that was seid bi aungels, was maad sad, and ech brekyng of the lawe and vnobedience took iust retribucioun of meede,
hou schulen we ascape, if we despisen so greet an heelthe? Which, whanne it hadde takun bigynnyng to be teld out by the Lord, of hem that herden is confermyd in to vs.
For God witnesside to gidere bi myraclis, and wondris, and grete merueilis, and dyuerse vertues, and departyngis of the Hooli Goost, bi his wille.
But not to aungels God sugetide the world that is to comynge, of which we speken.
But sum man witnesside in a place, and seide, What thing is man, that thou art myndeful of hym, or mannus sone, for thou visitist hym?
Thou hast maad hym a litil lesse than aungels; thou hast corowned hym with glorie and onour; and thou hast ordeyned him on the werkis of thin hondis.
Thou hast maad alle thingis suget vndur hise feet. And in that that he sugetide alle thingis to hym, he lefte no thing vnsuget to him. But now we seen not yit alle thingis suget to hym;
but we seen hym that was maad a litil lesse than aungels, Jhesu, for the passioun of deth crowned with glorie and onour, that he thorouy grace of God schulde taste deth for alle men.
For it bisemede hym, for whom alle thingis, and bi whom `alle thingis weren maad, which hadde brouyt many sones into glorie, and was auctour of the heelthe of hem, that he hadde an ende bi passioun.
For he that halewith, and thei that ben halewid, ben alle of oon; for which cause he is not schamed to clepe hem britheren,
seiynge, Y schal telle thi name to my britheren; in the myddil of the chirche Y schal herie thee.
And eftsoone, Y schal be tristnynge in to hym; and eftsoone, Lo! Y and my children, whiche God yaf to me.
Therfor for children comyneden to fleisch and blood, and he also took part of the same, that bi deth he schulde destrie hym that hadde lordschipe of deth, that is to seie, the deuel,
and that he schulde delyuere hem that bi drede of deth, `bi al lijf weren boundun to seruage.
And he took neuere aungelis, but he took the seed of Abraham.
Wherfor he ouyte to be likned to britheren bi alle thingis, that he schulde be maad merciful and a feithful bischop to God, that he schulde be merciful to the trespassis of the puple.
For in that thing in which he suffride, and was temptid, he is miyti to helpe also hem that ben temptid.

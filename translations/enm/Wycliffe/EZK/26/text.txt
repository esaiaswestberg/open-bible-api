And it was doon in the enleuenthe yeer, in the firste dai of the monethe, the word of the Lord was maad to me, and he seide,
Thou, sone of man, for that that Tire seide of Jerusalem, Wel! the yatis of puplis ben brokun, it is turned to me; Y schal be fillid, it is forsakun;
therfor the Lord God seith these thingis, Lo! Tire, Y on thee; and Y schal make many folkis to stie to thee, as the see flowynge stieth.
And thei schulen distrie the wallis of Tire, and thei schulen distrie the touris therof; and Y schal rase the dust therof fro it, and Y schal yyue it in to a `moost clere stoon.
Driyng of nettis schal be in the myddis of the see, for Y spak, seith the Lord God. And Tire schal be in to rauysching to hethene men.
And the douytris therof that ben in the feeld, schulen be slayn bi swerd; and thei schulen wite, that Y am the Lord.
For whi the Lord God seith these thingis, Lo! Y schal brynge to Tire Nabugodonosor, the king of Babiloyne, fro the north, the kyng of kyngis, with horsis, and charis, and knyytis, and with a cumpeny, and greet puple.
He schal sle bi swerd thi douytris that ben in the feeld, and he schal cumpasse thee with strengthingis, and he schal bere togidere erthe in cumpas. And he schal reise a scheeld ayens thee,
and he schal tempre engynes lijc vineres, and engines `that ben clepid wetheris ayens thi wallis; and he schal distrie thi touris bi his armure.
Bi flowynge of his horsis, the dust of tho schal hile thee; thi wallis schulen be mouyd of the soun of knyytis, and of wheelis, and of charis; whanne he schal entre bi the yatis, as bi entryngis of a citee distried,
with the clees of hise horsis he schal defoule alle thi stretis. He shal sle bi swerd thi puple, and thi noble ymagis schulen falle doun in to erthe.
Thei schulen waste thi richessis, thei schulen rauysche thi marchaundies; and thei schulen distrie thi wallis, and thei schulen distrie thin housis ful clere, and thi stoonys, and thi trees, and thei schulen putte thi dust in the myddis of watris.
And Y schal make to reste the multitude of thi syngeris, and the sown of thin harpis schal no more be herd;
and Y schal yyue thee in to a moost cleer stoon. Thou schalt be driyng of nettis, and thou schalt no more be bildid, for Y the Lord spak, seith the Lord God.
The Lord God seith these thingis of Tire, Whether ilis schulen not be moued of the sown of thi fal, and of weiling of thi slayn men, whanne thei ben slayn in the myddis of thee?
And alle the princis of the see schulen go doun of her seetis, and thei schulen do awei her mentils, ether spuylis of slayn enemyes, and thei schulen caste awei her dyuerse clothis, and shulen be clothid with wondring. Thei shulen sitte in the erthe, and thei shulen be astonyed, and thei shulen wondre of thi sodeyn fal.
And thei shulen take weilyng on thee, and schule seie to thee, Hou perischidist thou, noble citee, that dwellist in the see, that were strong in the see with thi dwelleris, whiche dwelleris alle men dredden?
Now schippis schulen wondre in the dai of thi drede, and ilis in the see schulen be disturblid, for noon goith out of thee.
For the Lord God seith these thingis, Whanne Y schal yyue thee a citee desolat, as the citees that ben not enhabitid, and Y schal bringe on thee the depthe of watris, and many watris schulen hile thee.
And Y schal drawe thee doun with hem that goon doun in to a lake, to the puple euerlastynge; and Y schal sette thee in the laste lond, as elde wildirnessis, with hem that ben led doun in to a lake, that thou be not enhabited. Certis whanne Y schal yyue glorye in the lond of lyueris,
Y schal dryue thee in to nouyt, and thou schalt not be; and thou schalt be souyt, and thou schalt no more be foundun with outen ende, seith the Lord God.

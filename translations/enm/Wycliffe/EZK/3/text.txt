And he seide to me, Sone of man, ete thou what euer thing thou fyndist, ete thou this volym; and go thou, and speke to the sones of Israel.
And Y openyde my mouth, and he fedde me with that volym.
And he seide to me, Sone of man, thi wombe schal ete, and thin entrails schulen be fillid with this volym, which Y yyue to thee. And Y eet it, and it was maad as swete hony in my mouth.
And he seide to me, Sone of man, go thou to the hous of Israel, and thou schalt speke my wordis to hem.
For thou schalt not be sent to a puple of hiy word, and of vnknowun langage; thou schalt be sent to the hous of Israel,
nether to many puplis of hiy word, and of vnknowun langage, of whiche thou maist not here the wordis. And if thou were sent to hem, thei schulden here thee.
But the hous of Israel nylen here thee, for thei nylen here me. For al the hous of Israel is of vnschamefast forheed, and of hard herte.
Lo! Y yaf thi face strongere than the faces of hem, and thi forheed hardere than the forheedis of hem.
Y yaf thi face as an adamaunt, and as a flynt; drede thou not hem, nether drede thou of the face of hem, for it is an hous terrynge to wraththe.
And he seide to me, Sone of man, take in thin herte, and here with thin eeris alle these my wordis, whiche Y speke to thee.
And go thou, and entre to the passyng ouer, to the sones of thi puple. And thou schalt speke to hem, and thou schalt seie to hem, The Lord God seith these thingis, if perauenture thei heren, and resten.
And the spirit took me, and Y herde after me the vois of a greet mouyng. The blessid glorie of the Lord was herd fro his place;
and Y herde the vois of wyngis of the beestis smytynge oon an othir, and the vois of wheelis suynge the beestis, and the vois of greet stiryng.
Also the spirit reiside me, and took me. And Y yede forth bittir in the indignacioun of my spirit; for the hond of the Lord was with me, and coumfortide me.
And Y cam to the passyng ouer, to the heep of newe fruytis, to hem that dwelliden bisidis the flood Chobar. And Y sat where thei saten, and Y dwellide there seuene daies, weilynge, in the myddis of hem.
Forsothe whanne seuene daies weren passid, the word of the Lord was maad to me, and seide, Sone of man,
Y yaf thee `a spiere to the hous of Israel. And thou schalt here of my mouth a word, and thou schalt telle to hem of me.
If whanne Y seie to the wickid man, Thou schalt die bi deth, thou tellist not to hym, and spekist not to hym, that he be turned fro his wickid weie, and lyue; thilke wickid man schal die in his wickidnesse, but Y schal seke his blood of thin hond.
Forsothe if thou tellist to the wickid man, and he is not conuertid fro his wickidnesse, and fro his wickid weie; sotheli he schal die in his wickidnesse, but thou hast delyuerid thi soule.
But also if a iust man is turned fro his riytfulnesse, and doith wickidnesse, Y schal sette an hirtyng bifor hym; he schal die, for thou teldist not to hym; he schal die in his synne, and hise riytfulnessis, whiche he dide, schulen not be in mynde, but Y schal seke his blood of thin hond.
Forsothe if thou tellist to a iust man, that a iust man do not synne, and he doith not synne, he lyuynge schal lyue, for thou teldist to hym, and thou hast delyuered thi soule.
And the hond of the Lord was maad on me, and he seide to me, Rise thou, and go out in to the feeld, and there Y schal speke with thee.
And Y roos, and yede out in to the feeld. And lo! the glorie of the Lord stood there, as the glorie which Y siy bisidis the flood Chobar; and Y felle doun on my face.
And the spirit entride in to me, and settide me on my feet. And he spak to me, and seide to me, Entre thou, and be thou closid in the myddis of thin hous.
And thou, sone of man, lo! boondis ben youun on thee, and thei schulen bynde thee with tho, and thou schalt not go out in the myddis of hem.
And Y schal make thi tunge to cleue to the roof of thi mouth, and thou schalt be doumbe, and thou schalt not be as a man rebuykinge; for it is an hous terrynge to wraththe.
But whanne Y schal speke to thee, Y schal opene thi mouth, and thou schalt seie to hem, The Lord God seith these thingis, He that herith, here, and he that restith, reste; for it is an hous terrynge to wraththe.

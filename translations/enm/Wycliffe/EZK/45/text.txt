And whanne ye schulen bigynne to departe the lond bi partis, departe ye the firste thingis to the Lord, an halewid thing of the lond, fyue and twenti thousynde of rehedis in lengthe, and ten thousynde of rehedis in breede; it schal be halewid in al the coost therof by cumpas.
And it schal be halewid on ech part in fyue hundrid rehedis bi fyue hundrid, in foure sidis bi cumpas, and in fifti cubitis in to the subarbis therof bi cumpas.
And fro this mesure thou schalt mete the lengthe of fyue and twenti thousynde of rehedis, and the breede of ten thousynde; and the temple and the hooli of hooli thingis schal be in it.
An halewid thing of the lond schal be to prestis, the mynystris of seyntuarie, that neiyen to the seruyce of the Lord; and a place schal be to hem in to housis, and in to the seyntuarie of hoolynesse.

And ye schulen yyue the possessioun of the citee, fyue thousynde rehedis of breede, and fyue and twenti thousynde of lengthe, bi the departyng of the seyntuarie, to al the hous of Israel.

The Lord God seith these thingis, O! princes of Israel, suffice it to you, leue ye wickidnesse `and raueyns, and do ye doom and riytfulnesse; departe ye youre niy coostis fro my puple, seith the Lord God.

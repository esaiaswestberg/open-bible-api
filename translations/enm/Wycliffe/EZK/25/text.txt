And Y schal yyue Rabath in to a dwellyng place of camels, and the sones of Amon in to a bed of beestis; and ye schulen wite, that Y am the Lord.

and Cariathaym, to the sones of the eest, with the sones of Amon. And Y schal yyue it in to eritage, that mynde of the sones of Amon be no more among hethene men,
and in Moab Y schal make domes; and thei schulen wite, that Y am the Lord.

And Y schal yyue my veniaunce on Idumee, bi the hond of my puple Israel; and thei schulen do in Edom bi my wraththe, and bi my strong veniaunce; and thei schulen knowe my veniaunce, seith the Lord God.

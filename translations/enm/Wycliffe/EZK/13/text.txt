And the word of the Lord was maad to me,
and he seide, Sone of man, profesie thou to the profetis of Israel that profesien; and thou schalt seie to hem that profesien of her herte,
Here ye the word of the Lord. The Lord God seith these thingis, Wo to the vnwise profetis, that suen her spirit, and seen no thing;
Israel, thi profetis weren as foxis in desert.
Ye stieden not euene ayens, nether ayensettiden a wal for the hous of Israel, that ye shulden stonde in batel in the dai of the Lord.
Thei seen veyn thingis, and deuynen a leesyng, and seien, The Lord seith, whanne the Lord sente not hem; and thei contynueden to conferme the word.
Whether ye seen not a veyn visioun, and spaken fals diuynyng, and seiden, The Lord seith, whanne Y spak not?
Therfor the Lord God seith these thingis, For ye spaken veyn thingis, and sien a leesyng, therfor lo! Y to you, seith the Lord God.
And myn hond schal be on the profetis that seen veyn thingis, and dyuynen a leesyng; thei schulen not be in the councel of my puple, and thei schulen not be writun in the scripture of the hous of Israel, nether thei schulen entre in to the lond of Israel; and ye schulen wite, that Y am the Lord God.
For thei disseyueden my puple, and seiden, Pees, pees, and no pees is; and it bildide a wal, but thei pargitiden it with fen with out chaffis.
Seie thou to hem that pargiten with out temperure, that it schal falle doun; for a strong reyn schal be flowynge, and I shal yyue ful grete stoones fallinge fro aboue, and Y schal yyue a wynd of tempest that distrieth.
For lo! the wal felle doun. Whether it schal not be seid to you, Where is the pargetyng, which ye pargetiden?
Therfor the Lord God seith these thingis, And Y schal make the spirit of tempestis to breke out in myn indignacioun, and strong reyn flowynge in my strong veniaunce schal be, and greet stoonys in wraththe in to wastyng.
And Y schal distrie the wal, which ye pargetiden with out temperure, and Y schal make it euene with the erthe; and the foundement therof schal be schewid, and it schal falle doun, and it schal be wastid in the myddis therof; and ye schulen wite, that Y am the Lord.
And Y schal fille myn indignacioun in the wal, and in hem that pargeten it with out temperure; and Y schal seie to you, The wal is not, and thei ben not,
that pargeten it, the profetis of Israel, that profesien to Jerusalem, and seen to it the visioun of pees, and pees is not, seith the Lord God.
And thou, sone of man, sette thi face ayens the douytris of thi puple, that profesien of her herte; and profesie thou on hem,
and seie thou, The Lord God seith these thingis, Wo to hem that sowen togidere cuschens vndur ech cubit of hond, and maken pilewis vndur the heed of ech age, to take soulis; and whanne thei disseyueden the soulis of my puple, thei quykenyden the soulis of hem.
And thei defouliden me to my puple, for an handful of barli, and for a gobet of breed, that thei schulden sle soulis that dien not, and quykene soulis that lyuen not; and thei lieden to my puple, bileuynge to leesyngis.
For this thing the Lord God seith these thingis, Lo! Y to youre cuschens, bi whiche ye disseyuen soulis fliynge; and Y schal al to-breke tho fro youre armes, and Y schal delyuere soulis which ye disseyuen, soulis to fle.
And Y schal al to-breke youre pilewis, and Y schal delyuere my puple fro youre hond; and thei schulen no more be in youre hondis, to be robbid; and ye schulen wite, that Y am the Lord.
For that that ye maden falsli the herte of a iust man to morene, whom Y made not sori; and ye coumfortiden the hondis of a wickid man, that he schulde not turne ayen fro his yuel weie, and lyue.
Therfor ye schulen not se veyn thingis, and ye schulen no more dyuyne false dyuynyngis; and Y schal delyuere my puple fro youre hond, and ye schulen wite, that Y am the Lord.

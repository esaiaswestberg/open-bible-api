The thre and nyntithe salm. God is Lord of veniauncis; God of veniauncis dide freli.
Be thou enhaunsid that demest the erthe; yelde thou yeldinge to proude men.
Lord, hou longe synneris; hou longe schulen synneris haue glorie?
Thei schulen telle out, and schulen speke wickidnesse; alle men schulen speke that worchen vnriytfulnesse.
Lord, thei han maad lowe thi puple; and thei han disesid thin eritage.
Thei killiden a widowe and a comelyng; and thei han slayn fadirles children and modirles.
And thei seiden, The Lord schal not se; and God of Jacob schal not vndurstonde.
Ye vnwise men in the puple, vndirstonde; and, ye foolis, lerne sum tyme.
Schal not he here, that plauntide the eere; ethere biholdith not he, that made the iye?
Schal not he repreue, that chastisith folkis; which techith man kunnyng?
The Lord knowith the thouytis of men; that tho ben veyne.
Blessid is the man, whom thou, Lord, hast lerned; and hast tauyt him of thi lawe.
That thou aswage hym fro yuele daies; til a diche be diggid to the synner.
For the Lord schal not putte awei his puple; and he schal not forsake his eritage.
Til riytfulnesse be turned in to dom; and who ben niy it, alle that ben of riytful herte.
Who schal rise with me ayens mysdoeris; ether who schal stonde with me ayens hem that worchen wickidnesse?
No but for the Lord helpide me; almest my soule hadde dwellid in helle.
If Y seide, My foot was stirid; Lord, thi merci helpide me.
Aftir the multitude of my sorewis in myn herte; thi coumfortis maden glad my soule.
Whether the seete of wickidnesse cleueth to thee; that makist trauel in comaundement?
Thei schulen take ayens the soule of a iust man; and thei schulen condempne innocent blood.
And the Lord was maad to me in to refuyt; and my God was maad in to the help of myn hope.
And he schal yelde to hem the wickidnesse of hem; and in the malice of hem he schal lese hem, oure Lord God schal lese hem.

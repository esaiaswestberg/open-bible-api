The titil of the nyne and nyntithe salm. `A salm to knouleche; `in Ebrew `thus, A salm for knouleching.
Al erthe, singe ye hertli to God; serue ye the Lord in gladnesse. Entre ye in his siyt; in ful out ioiyng.
Wite ye, that the Lord hym silf is God; he made vs, and not we maden vs. His puple, and the scheep of his lesewe,
entre ye in to hise yatis in knoulechyng; entre ye in to hise porchis, `knouleche ye to him in ympnes.
Herye ye his name, for the Lord is swete, his merci is with outen ende; and his treuthe is in generacioun and in to generacioun.

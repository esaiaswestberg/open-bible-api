The title of the sixte and fiftithe salm. `In Ebreu thus, To the victorie, lese thou not the semeli song, `ether the `swete song of Dauid, `whanne he fledde fro the face of Saul in to the denne. `In Jeroms translacioun thus, For victorie, that thou lese not Dauid, meke and simple, whanne he fledde fro the face of Saul in to the denne.
God, haue thou merci on me, haue thou merci on me; for my soule tristith in thee. And Y schal hope in the schadewe of thi wyngis; til wickidnesse passe.
I schal crye to God altherhiyeste; to God that dide wel to me.
He sente fro heuene, and delyuerede me; he yaf in to schenschip hem that defoulen me. God sente his merci and his treuthe,
and delyuerede my soule fro the myddis of whelpis of liouns; Y slepte disturblid. The sones of men, the teeth of hem ben armuris and arowis; and her tunge is a scharp swerd.
God, be thou enhaunsid aboue heuenes; and thi glorie aboue al erthe.
Thei maden redi a snare to my feet; and thei greetly boweden my lijf. Thei delueden a diche bifore my face; and thei felden doun in to it.
God, myn herte is redi, myn herte is redi; Y schal singe, and Y schal seie salm.
Mi glorie, rise thou vp; sautrie and harpe, rise thou vp; Y schal rise vp eerli.
Lord, Y schal knouleche to thee among puplis; and Y schal seie salm among hethene men.
For thi merci is magnified til to heuenes; and thi treuthe til to cloudis.
God, be thou enhaunsid aboue heuenes; and thi glorie ouer al erthe.

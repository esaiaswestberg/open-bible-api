The `title of the hundrid and eiyte and fourtithe salm. Alleluya. Ye of heuenes, herie the Lord; herie ye hym in hiye thingis.
Alle hise aungels, herie ye hym; alle hise vertues, herye ye hym.
Sunne and moone, herie ye hym; alle sterris and liyt, herie ye hym.
Heuenes of heuenes, herie ye hym; and the watris that ben aboue heuenes,
herie ye the name of the Lord.
For he seide, and thingis weren maad; he comaundide, and thingis weren maad of nouyt. He ordeynede tho thingis in to the world, and in to the world of world; he settide a comaundement, and it schal not passe.
Ye of erthe, herie ye the Lord; dragouns, and alle depthis of watris.
Fier, hail, snow, iys, spiritis of tempestis; that don his word.
Mounteyns, and alle litle hillis; trees berynge fruyt, and alle cedris.
Wielde beestis, and alle tame beestis; serpentis, and fetherid briddis.
The kingis of erthe, and alle puplis; the princis, and alle iugis of erthe.
Yonge men, and virgyns, elde men with yongere, herie ye the name of the Lord;
for the name of hym aloone is enhaunsid.
His knouleching be on heuene and erthe; and he hath enhaunsid the horn of his puple. An ympne be to alle hise seyntis; to the children of Israel, to a puple neiyynge to hym.

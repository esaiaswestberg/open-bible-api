The `title of the hundrid and nynthe salm. `The salm of Dauith. The Lord seide to my Lord; Sitte thou on my riyt side. Til Y putte thin enemyes; a stool of thi feet.
The Lord schal sende out fro Syon the yerde of thi vertu; be thou lord in the myddis of thin enemyes.
The bigynnyng is with thee in the dai of thi vertu, in the briytnessis of seyntis; Y gendride thee of the wombe before the dai sterre.
The Lord swoor, and it schal not repente him; Thou art a preest with outen ende, bi the ordre of Melchisedech.
The Lord on thi riyt side; hath broke kyngis in the dai of his veniaunce.
He schal deme among naciouns, he schal fille fallyngis; he schal schake heedis in the lond of many men.
He dranke of the stronde in the weie; therfor he enhaunside the heed.

The title of the sixte salm. To the ouercomere in salmes, the salm of Dauid, `on the eiythe.
Lord, repreue thou not me in thi stronge veniaunce; nether chastice thou me in thin ire.
Lord, haue thou merci on me, for Y am sijk; Lord, make thou me hool, for alle my boonys ben troblid.
And my soule is troblid greetli; but thou, Lord, hou long?
Lord, be thou conuertid, and delyuere my soule; make thou me saaf, for thi merci.
For noon is in deeth, which is myndful of thee; but in helle who schal knouleche to thee?
I traueilide in my weilyng, Y schal waische my bed bi ech nyyt; Y schal moiste, `ether make weet, my bedstre with my teeris.
Myn iye is disturblid of woodnesse; Y waxe eld among alle myn enemyes.
Alle ye that worchen wickidnesse, departe fro me; for the Lord hath herd the vois of my wepyng.
The Lord hath herd my bisechyng; the Lord hath resseyued my preier.
Alle my enemyes be aschamed, and be disturblid greetli; be thei turned togidere, and be thei aschamed ful swiftli.

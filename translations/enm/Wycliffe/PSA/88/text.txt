The title of the eiyte and eiytetithe salm. The lernyng of Ethan, Ezraite.
I schal synge with outen ende; the mercies of the Lord. In generacioun and in to generacioun; Y schal telle thi treuthe with my mouth.
For thou seidist, With outen ende merci schal be bildid in heuenes; thi treuthe schal be maad redi in tho.
I disposide a testament to my chosun men; Y swoor to Dauid, my seruaunt,
Til in to with outen ende I schal make redi thi seed. And Y schal bilde thi seete; in generacioun, and in to generacioun.
Lord, heuenes schulen knouleche thi merueilis; and thi treuthe in the chirche of seyntis.
For who in the cloudis schal be maad euene to the Lord; schal be lijk God among the sones of God?
God, which is glorified in the counsel of seyntis; is greet, and dreedful ouere alle that ben in his cumpas.
Lord God of vertues, who is lijk thee? Lord, thou art miyti, and thi treuthe is in thi cumpas.
Thou art Lord of the power of the see; forsothe thou aswagist the stiryng of the wawis therof.
Thou madist lowe the proude, as woundid; in the arm of thi vertu thou hast scaterid thin enemyes.
Heuenes ben thin, and erthe is thin; thou hast foundid the world, and the fulnesse therof;
thou madist of nouyt the north and the see. Thabor and Hermon schulen make ful out ioye in thi name;
thin arm with power. Thin hond be maad stidefast, and thi riythond be enhaunsid;
riytfulnesse and doom is the makyng redy of thi seete. Merci and treuthe schulen go bifore thi face;
blessid is the puple that kan hertli song. Lord, thei schulen go in the liyt of thi cheer;
and in thi name thei schulen make ful out ioye al dai; and thei schulen be enhaunsid in thi riytfulnesse.
For thou art the glorie of the vertu of hem; and in thi good plesaunce oure horn schal be enhaunsid.
For oure takyng vp is of the Lord; and of the hooli of Israel oure kyng.
Thanne thou spakist in reuelacioun to thi seyntis, and seidist, Y haue set help in the myyti; and Y haue enhaunsid the chosun man of my puple.
I foond Dauid, my seruaunt; Y anoyntide hym with myn hooli oile.
For myn hond schal helpe him; and myn arm schal conferme hym.
The enemye schal no thing profite in him; and the sone of wickidnesse schal not `ley to, for to anoye him.
And Y schal sle hise enemyes fro his face; and Y schal turne in to fliyt hem that haten hym.
And my treuthe and mercy schal be with him; and his horn schal be enhaunsid in my name.
And Y schal sette his hond in the see; and his riyt hoond in flodis.
He schal inwardli clepe me, Thou art my fadir; my God, and the vptaker of myn heelthe.
And Y schal sette him the firste gendrid sone; hiyer than the kyngis of erthe.
With outen ende Y schal kepe my merci to hym; and my testament feithful to him.
And Y schal sette his seed in to the world of world; and his trone as the daies of heuene.
Forsothe if hise sones forsaken my lawe; and goen not in my domes.
If thei maken vnhooli my riytfulnessis; and kepen not my comaundementis.
I schal visite in a yerde the wickidnessis of hem; and in betyngis the synnes of hem.
But Y schal not scatere my mercy fro hym; and in my treuthe Y schal not anoye hym.
Nethir Y schal make vnhooli my testament; and Y schal not make voide tho thingis that comen forth of my lippis.
Onys Y swoor in myn hooli;
Y schal not lie to Dauid, his seed schal dwelle with outen ende.
And his trone as sunne in my siyt, and as a perfit mone with outen ende; and a feithful witnesse in heuene.
But thou hast put awei, and hast dispisid; and hast dilaied thi crist.
Thou hast turned awei the testament of thi seruaunt; thou madist vnhooli his seyntuarie in erthe.
Thou distriedist alle the heggis therof; thou hast set the stidefastnesse therof drede.
Alle men passynge bi the weie rauyschiden him; he is maad schenschipe to hise neiyboris.
Thou hast enhaunsid the riythond of men oppressinge him; thou hast gladid alle hise enemyes.
Thou hast turned awei the help of his swerd; and thou helpidist not hym in batel.
Thou destriedist him fro clensing; and thou hast hurtlid doun his seete in erthe.
Thou hast maad lesse the daies of his time; thou hast bisched him with schenschip.
Lord, hou longe turnest thou awei in to the ende; schal thin ire brenne out as fier?
Bithenke thou what is my substaunce; for whether thou hast ordeyned veynli alle the sones of men?
Who is a man, that schal lyue, and schal not se deth; schal delyuere his soule fro the hond of helle?
Lord, where ben thin elde mercies; as thou hast swore to Dauid in thi treuthe?
Lord, be thou myndeful of the schenschipe of thi seruauntis, of many hethene men; whiche Y helde togidere in my bosum.
Whiche thin enemyes, Lord, diden schenschipfuli; for thei dispisiden the chaungyng of thi crist.
Blessid be the Lord with outen ende; be it don, be it don.

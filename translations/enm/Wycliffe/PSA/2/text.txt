Whi gnastiden with teeth hethene men; and puplis thouyten veyn thingis?
The kyngis of erthe stoden togidere; and princes camen togidere ayens the Lord, and ayens his Crist?
Breke we the bondis of hem; and cast we awei the yok of hem fro vs.
He that dwellith in heuenes schal scorne hem; and the Lord schal bimowe hem.
Thanne he schal speke to hem in his ire; and he schal disturble hem in his stronge veniaunce.
Forsothe Y am maad of hym a kyng on Syon, his hooli hil; prechynge his comaundement.
The Lord seide to me, Thou art my sone; Y haue gendrid thee to dai.
Axe thou of me, and Y schal yyue to thee hethene men thin eritage; and thi possessioun the termes of erthe.
Thou schalt gouerne hem in an yrun yerde; and thou schalt breke hem as the vessel of a pottere.
And now, ye kyngis, vndurstonde; ye that demen the erthe, be lerud.
Serue ye the Lord with drede; and make ye ful ioye to hym with tremblyng.
Take ye lore; lest the Lord be wrooth sumtyme, and lest ye perischen fro iust waie.
Whanne his `ire brenneth out in schort tyme; blessed ben alle thei, that tristen in hym.

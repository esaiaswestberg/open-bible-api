The titil of the hundrid and fourtenthe salm. Alleluia. I louede `the Lord; for the Lord schal here the vois of my preier.
For he bowide doun his eere to me; and Y schal inwardli clepe in my daies.
The sorewis of deth cumpassiden me; and the perelis of helle founden me.
I foond tribulacioun and sorewe; and Y clepide inwardli the name of the Lord. Thou, Lord, delyuere my soule;
the Lord is merciful, and iust; and oure God doith merci.
And the Lord kepith litle children; Y was mekid, and he delyuerede me.
Mi soule, turne thou in to thi reste; for the Lord hath do wel to thee.
For he hath delyuered my soule fro deth; myn iyen fro wepingis, my feet fro fallyng doun.
I schal plese the Lord; in the cuntrei of hem that lyuen.

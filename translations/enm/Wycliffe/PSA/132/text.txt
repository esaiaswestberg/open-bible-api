The `title of the hundrid and two and thrittithe salm. The song of grecis. Lo! hou good and hou myrie it is; that britheren dwelle togidere.
As oynement in the heed; that goith doun in to the beerd, in to the beerd of Aaron. That goith doun in to the coler of his cloth; as the dew of Ermon,
that goith doun in to the hil of Sion. For there the Lord sente blessing; and lijf til in to the world.

The title of the five and fourtithe salm. To the ouercomere, the song of the sones `of Chore, `for yongthis.
Oure God, thou art refuyt, and vertu; helpere in tribulacions, that han founde vs greetly.
Therfor we schulen not drede, while the erthe schal be troblid; and the hillis schulen be borun ouer in to the herte of the see.
The watris of hem sowneden, and weren troblid; hillis weren troblid togidere in the strengthe of hym.
The feersnesse of flood makith glad the citee of God; the hiyeste God hath halewid his tabernacle.
God in the myddis therof schal not be moued; God schal helpe it eerli in the grey morewtid.
Hethene men weren disturblid togidere, and rewmes weren bowid doun; God yaf his vois, the erthe was moued.
The Lord of vertues is with vs; God of Jacob is oure vptakere.
Come ye, and se the werkis of the Lord; whiche wondris he hath set on the erthe.
He doynge awei batels til to the ende of the lond; schal al to-brese bouwe, and schal breke togidere armuris, and schal brenne scheldis bi fier.
Yyue ye tent, and se ye, that Y am God; Y schal be enhaunsid among hethene men; and Y schal be enhaunsid in erthe.
The Lord of vertues is with vs; God of Jacob is oure vptakere.

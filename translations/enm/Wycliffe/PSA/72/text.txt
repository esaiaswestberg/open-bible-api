The `title of the two and seuentithe salm. `The salm of Asaph. God of Israel is ful good; to hem that ben of riytful herte.
But my feet weren moued almeest; my steppis weren sched out almeest.
For Y louede feruentli on wickid men; seynge the pees of synneris.
For biholdyng is not to the deth of hem; and stidefastnesse in the sikenesse of hem.
Thei ben not in the trauel of men; and thei schulen not be betun with men.
Therfore pride helde hem; thei weren hilid with her wickidnesse and vnfeithfulnesse.
The wickidnesse of hem cam forth as of fatnesse; thei yeden in to desire of herte.
Thei thouyten and spaken weiwardnesse; thei spaken wickidnesse an hiy.
Thei puttiden her mouth in to heuene; and her tunge passide in erthe.
Therfor my puple schal be conuertid here; and fulle daies schulen be foundun in hem.
And thei seiden, How woot God; and whether kunnyng is an heiye, `that is, in heuene?
Lo! thilke synneris and hauynge aboundance in the world; helden richessis.
And Y seide, Therfor without cause Y iustifiede myn herte; and waischide myn hoondis among innocentis.
And Y was betun al dai; and my chastisyng was in morutidis.
If Y seide, Y schal telle thus; lo! Y repreuede the nacioun of thi sones.
I gesside, that Y schulde knowe this; trauel is bifore me.
Til Y entre in to the seyntuarie of God; and vndurstonde in the last thingis of hem.
Netheles for gilis thou hast put to hem; thou castidist hem doun, while thei weren reisid.
Hou ben thei maad into desolacioun; thei failiden sodeynli, thei perischiden for her wickidnesse.
As the dreem of men that risen; Lord, thou schalt dryue her ymage to nouyt in thi citee.
For myn herte is enflaumed, and my reynes ben chaungid;
and Y am dryuun to nouyt, and Y wiste not.
As a werk beeste Y am maad at thee; and Y am euere with thee.
Thou heldist my riythond, and in thi wille thou leddist me forth; and with glorie thou tokist me vp.
For whi what is to me in heuene; and what wolde Y of thee on erthe?
Mi fleische and myn herte failide; God of myn herte, and my part is God withouten ende.
For lo! thei that drawen awei fer hem silf fro thee, `bi deedli synne, schulen perische; thou hast lost alle men that doen fornycacioun fro thee.
But it is good to me to cleue to God; and to sette myn hope in the Lord God. That Y telle alle thi prechyngis; in the yatis of the douyter of Syon.

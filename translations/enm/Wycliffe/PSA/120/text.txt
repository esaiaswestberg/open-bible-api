The `title of the hundrid and twentithe salm. The song of greces. I reiside myn iyen to the hillis; fro whannus help schal come to me.
Myn help is of the Lord; that made heuene and erthe.
The Lord yyue not thi foot in to mouyng; nether he nappe, that kepith thee.
Lo! he schal not nappe, nether slepe; that kepith Israel.
The Lord kepith thee; the Lord is thi proteccioun aboue thi riythond.
The sunne schal not brenne thee bi dai; nether the moone bi nyyt.
The Lord kepe thee fro al yuel; the Lord kepe thi soule.
The Lord kepe thi goyng in and thi goyng out; fro this tyme now and in to the world.

The `title of the hundrid and twelfthe salm. Alleluya. Children, preise ye the Lord; preise ye the name of the Lord.
The name of the Lord be blessid; fro this tyme now and til in to the world.
Fro the risyng of the sunne til to the goyng doun; the name of the Lord is worthi to be preisid.
The Lord is hiy aboue alle folkis; and his glorie is aboue heuenes.
Who is as oure Lord God, that dwellith in hiye thingis;
and biholdith meke thingis in heuene and in erthe?
Reisynge a nedi man fro the erthe; and enhaunsinge a pore man fro drit.
That he sette hym with princes; with the princes of his puple.
Which makith a bareyn womman dwelle in the hous; a glad modir of sones.

The title of the eiyt and twentithe salm. The salm, ethir song of Dauid. Ye sones of God, brynge to the Lord; brynge ye to the Lord the sones of rammes.
Brynge ye to the Lord glorie and onour; brynge ye to the Lord glorie to his name; herie ye the Lord in his hooli large place.
The vois of the Lord on watris, God of mageste thundride; the Lord on many watris.
The vois of the Lord in vertu; the vois of the Lord in greet doyng.
The vois of the Lord brekynge cedris; and the Lord schal breke the cedris of the Liban.
And he schal al to-breke hem to dust as a calf of the Liban; and the derling was as the sone of an vnycorn.
The vois of the Lord departynge the flawme of fier;
the vois of the Lord schakynge desert; and the Lord schal stire togidere the desert of Cades.
The vois of the Lord makynge redi hertis, and he schal schewe thicke thingis; and in his temple alle men schulen seie glorie.
The Lord makith to enhabite the greet flood; and the Lord schal sitte kyng with outen ende.
The Lord schal yyue vertu to his puple; the Lord schal blesse his puple in pees.

The title of the hundrid and oon and thrittithe salm. The song of greces. Lord, haue thou mynde on Dauid; and of al his myldenesse.
As he swoor to the Lord; he made a vowe to God of Jacob.
I schal not entre in to the tabernacle of myn hous; Y schal not stie in to the bed of mi restyng.
I schal not yyue sleep to myn iyen; and napping to myn iye liddis.
And rest to my templis, til Y fynde a place to the Lord; a tabernacle to God of Jacob.
Lo! we herden that arke of testament in Effrata, `that is, in Silo; we founden it in the feeldis of the wode.
We schulen entre in to the tabernacle of hym; we schulen worschipe in the place, where hise feet stoden.
Lord, rise thou in to thi reste; thou and the ark of thin halewing.
Thi prestis be clothid with riytfulnesse; and thi seyntis make ful out ioye.
For Dauid, thi seruaunt; turne thou not awei the face of thi crist.
The Lord swoor treuthe to Dauid, and he schal not make hym veyn; of the fruyt of thi wombe Y schal sette on thi seete.
If thi sones schulen kepe my testament; and my witnessingis, these whiche Y schal teche hem. And the sones of hem til in to the world; thei schulen sette on thi seete.
For the Lord chees Sion; he chees it in to dwelling to hym silf.
This is my reste in to the world of world; Y schal dwelle here, for Y chees it.
I blessynge schal blesse the widewe of it; Y schal fille with looues the pore men of it.
I schal clothe with heelthe the preestis therof; and the hooli men therof schulen make ful out ioye in ful reioisinge.
Thidir Y schal bringe forth the horn of Dauid; Y made redi a lanterne to my crist.
I schal clothe hise enemyes with schame; but myn halewing schal floure out on hym.

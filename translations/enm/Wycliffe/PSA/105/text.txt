The `title of the hundrid and fifthe salm. Alleluya. Kouleche ye to the Lord, for he is good; for his mercy is with outen ende.
Who schal speke the powers of the Lord; schal make knowun alle hise preisyngis?
Blessid ben thei that kepen dom; and doon riytfulnesse in al tyme.
Lord, haue thou mynde on vs in the good plesaunce of thi puple; visite thou vs in thin heelthe.
To se in the goodnesse of thi chosun men, to be glad in the gladnes of thi folk; that thou be heried with thin eritage.
We han synned with oure fadris; we han do vniustli, we han do wickidnesse.
Oure fadris in Egipt vndirstoden not thi merueils; thei weren not myndeful of the multitude of thi merci. And thei stiynge in to the see, in to the reed see, terreden to wraththe;
and he sauede hem for his name, that `he schulde make knowun his power.
And he departide the reed see, and it was dried; and he lede forth hem in the depthis of watris as in deseert.
And he sauede hem fro the hond of hateris; and he ayen bouyte hem fro the hond of the enemye.
And the watir hilide men troublynge hem; oon of hem abood not.
And thei bileueden to hise wordis; and thei preisiden the heriynge of hym.
Thei hadden `soone do, thei foryaten hise werkis; and thei abididen not his councel.
And thei coueitiden coueitise in deseert; and temptiden God in a place with out watir.
And he yaf to hem the axyng of hem; and he sente fulnesse in to the soulis of hem.
And thei wraththiden Moyses in the castels; Aaron, the hooli of the Lord.
The erthe was opened, and swolewid Datan; and hilide on the congregacioun of Abiron.
And fier brente an hiye in the synagoge of hem; flawme brente synneris.
And thei maden a calf in Oreb; and worschipiden a yotun ymage.
And thei chaungiden her glorie; in to the liknesse of a calf etynge hei.
Thei foryaten God, that sauede hem, that dide grete werkis in Egipt,
merueils in the lond of Cham; feerdful thingis in the reed see.
And God seide, that he wolde leese hem; if Moises, his chosun man, hadde not stonde in the brekyng of his siyt. That he schulde turne awei his ire; lest he loste hem.
And thei hadden the desirable lond for nouyt, thei bileueden not to his word, and thei grutchiden in her tabernaclis;
thei herden not the vois of the Lord.
And he reiside his hond on hem; to caste doun hem in desert.
And to caste awei her seed in naciouns; and to leese hem in cuntreis.
And thei maden sacrifice to Belfagor; and thei eeten the sacrificis of deed beestis.
And thei wraththiden God in her fyndyngis; and fallyng was multiplied in hem.
And Fynees stood, and pleeside God; and the veniaunce ceesside.
And it was arrettid to hym to riytfulnesse; in generacioun and in to generacioun, til in to with outen ende.
And thei wraththiden God at the watris of ayenseiyng; and Moises was trauelid for hem, for thei maden bittere his spirit,
and he departide in his lippis.
Thei losten not hethen men; whiche the Lord seide to hem.
And thei weren meddlid among hethene men, and lerneden the werkis of hem,
and serueden the grauen ymagis of hem; and it was maad to hem in to sclaundre.
And thei offriden her sones; and her douytris to feendis.
And thei schedden out innocent blood, the blood of her sones and of her douytris; whiche thei sacrificiden to the grauun ymagis of Chanaan.
And the erthe was slayn in bloodis, and was defoulid in the werkis of hem; and thei diden fornicacioun in her fyndyngis.
And the Lord was wrooth bi strong veniaunce ayens his puple; and hadde abhominacioun of his eritage.
And he bitook hem in to the hondis of hethene men; and thei that hatiden hem, weren lordis of hem.
And her enemyes diden tribulacioun to hem, and thei weren mekid vndir the hondis of enemyes;
ofte he delyuerede hem. But thei wraththiden hym in her counsel; and thei weren maad low in her wickidnessis.
And he siye, whanne thei weren set in tribulacioun; and he herde the preyer of hem.
And he was myndeful of his testament; and it repentide hym bi the multitude of his merci.
And he yaf hem in to mercies; in the siyt of alle men, that hadden take hem.
Oure Lord God, make thou vs saaf; and gadere togidere vs fro naciouns. That we knouleche to thin hooli name; and haue glorie in thi preisyng.
Blessid be the Lord God of Israel fro the world and til in to the world; and al the puple schal seye, Be it don, be it don.

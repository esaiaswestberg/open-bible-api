Lord God of myn helthe; Y criede in dai and nyyt bifore thee.
Mi preier entre bifore thi siyt; bowe doun thin eere to my preier.
For my soule is fillid with yuels; and my lijf neiyede to helle.
I am gessid with hem that goon doun in to the lake; Y am maad as a man with outen help,
and fre among deed men. As men woundid slepinge in sepulcris, of whiche men noon is myndeful aftir; and thei ben put awei fro thin hond.
Thei han put me in the lower lake; in derke places, and in the schadewe of deth.
Thi strong veniaunce is confermed on me; and thou hast brouyt in alle thi wawis on me.
Thou hast maad fer fro me my knowun; thei han set me abhomynacioun to hem silf. I am takun, and Y yede not out;
myn iyen weren sijk for pouert. Lord, Y criede to thee; al dai Y spredde abrood myn hondis to thee.
Whethir thou schalt do merueils to deed men; ether leechis schulen reise, and thei schulen knouleche to thee?
Whether ony man in sepulcre schal telle thi merci; and thi treuthe in perdicioun?
Whether thi merueilis schulen be knowun in derknessis; and thi riytfulnesse in the lond of foryetyng?
And, Lord, Y criede to thee; and erli my preier schal bifor come to thee.
Lord, whi puttist thou awei my preier; turnest awei thi face fro me?
I am pore, and in traueils fro my yongthe; sotheli Y am enhaunsid, and Y am maad low, and disturblid.
Thi wraththis passiden on me; and thi dredis disturbliden me.
Thei cumpassiden me as watir al dai; thei cumpassiden me togidere.
Thou madist fer fro me a frend and neiybore; and my knowun fro wretchidnesse.

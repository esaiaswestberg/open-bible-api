The titil of the hundrid and thrittenthe salm. Alleluya. In the goyng out of Israel fro Egipt; of the hous of Jacob fro the hethene puple.
Judee was maad the halewyng of hym; Israel the power of hym.
The see siy, and fledde; Jordan was turned abac.
Munteyns ful out ioyeden as rammes; and litle hillis as the lambren of scheep.
Thou see, what was to thee, for thou fleddist; and thou, Jordan, for thou were turned abak?
Munteyns, ye maden ful out ioye as rammes; and litle hillis, as the lambren of scheep.
The erthe was moued fro the face of `the Lord; fro the face of God of Jacob.
Which turnede a stoon in to pondis of watris; and an hard rooch in to wellis of watris.
Lord, not to vs, not to vs; but yyue thou glorie to thi name.
On thi merci and thi treuthe; lest ony tyme hethene men seien, Where is the God of hem?
Forsothe oure God in heuene; dide alle thingis, whiche euere he wolde.
The symulacris of hethene men ben siluer and gold; the werkis of mennus hondis.
Tho han mouth, and schulen not speke; tho han iyen, and schulen not se.
Tho han eeris, and schulen not here; tho han nose thurls, and schulen not smelle.
Tho han hondis, and schulen not grope; tho han feet, and schulen not go; tho schulen not crye in her throte.
Thei that maken tho ben maad lijk tho; and alle that triste in tho.
The hous of Israel hopide in the Lord; he is the helpere `of hem, and the defendere of hem.
The hous of Aaron hopide in the Lord; he is the helpere of hem, and the defendere of hem.
Thei that dreden the Lord, hopiden in the Lord; he is the helpere of hem, and the defendere of hem.
The Lord was myndeful of vs; and blesside vs. He blesside the hous of Israel; he blesside the hous of Aaron.
He blesside alle men that dreden the Lord; `he blesside litle `men with the grettere.
The Lord encreesse on you; on you and on youre sones.
Blessid be ye of the Lord; that made heuene and erthe.
Heuene of `heuene is to the Lord; but he yaf erthe to the sones of men.
Lord, not deed men schulen herie thee; nether alle men that goen doun in to helle.
But we that lyuen, blessen the Lord; fro this tyme now and til in to the world.

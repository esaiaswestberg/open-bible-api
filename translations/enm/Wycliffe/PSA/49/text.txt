The title of the nyne and fourtithe salm. The salm of Asaph. God, the Lord of goddis, spak; and clepide the erthe,
fro the risynge of the sunne til to the goyng doun. The schap of his fairnesse fro Syon,
God schal come opynli; oure God, and he schal not be stille. Fier schal brenne an hiye in his siyt; and a strong tempest in his cumpas.
He clepide heuene aboue; and the erthe, to deme his puple.
Gadere ye to hym hise seyntis; that ordeynen his testament aboue sacrifices.
`And heuenes schulen schewe his riytfulnesse; for God is the iuge.
Mi puple, here thou, and Y schal speke to Israel; and Y schal witnesse to thee, Y am God, thi God.
I schal not repreue thee in thi sacrifices; and thi brent sacrifices ben euere bifor me.
I schal not take calues of thin hows; nethir geet buckis of thi flockis.
For alle the wyelde beestis of wodis ben myne; werk beestis, and oxis in hillis.
I haue knowe alle the volatils of heuene; and the fairnesse of the feeld is with me.
If Y schal be hungry, Y schal not seie to thee; for the world and the fulnesse therof is myn.
Whether Y schal eete the fleischis of boolis? ethir schal Y drynke the blood of geet buckis?
Offre thou to God the sacrifice of heriyng; and yelde thin avowis to the hiyeste God.
And inwardli clepe thou me in the dai of tribulacioun; and Y schal delyuere thee, and thou schalt onoure me.
But God seide to the synnere, Whi tellist thou out my riytfulnessis; and takist my testament bi thi mouth?
Sotheli thou hatidist lore; and hast cast awey my wordis bihynde.
If thou siyest a theef, thou `hast runne with hym; and thou settidist thi part with avowtreris.
Thi mouth was plenteuouse of malice; and thi tunge medlide togidere giles.
Thou sittynge spakist ayens thi brother, and thou settidist sclaundir ayens the sone of thi modir;
thou didist these thingis, and Y was stille. Thou gessidist wickidli, that Y schal be lijk thee; Y schal repreue thee, and Y schal sette ayens thi face.
Ye that foryeten God, vndurstonde these thingis; lest sum tyme he rauysche, and noon be that schal delyuere.
The sacrifice of heriyng schal onoure me; and there is the weie, where ynne Y schal schewe to hym the helthe of God.

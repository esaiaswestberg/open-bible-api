Lord, whi ben thei multiplied that disturblen me?
many men rysen ayens me. Many men seien of my soule, Noon helthe is to hym in his God.
But thou, Lord, art myn vptakere; my glorye, and enhaunsyng myn heed.
With my vois Y criede to the Lord; and he herde me fro his hooli hil.
I slepte, and `was quenchid, and Y roos vp; for the Lord resseyuede me.
I schal not drede thousyndis of puple cumpassynge me; Lord, rise thou vp; my God, make thou me saaf.
For thou hast smyte alle men beynge aduersaries to me with out cause; thou hast al to-broke the teeth of synneris.
Helthe is of the Lord; and thi blessyng, Lord, is on thi puple.

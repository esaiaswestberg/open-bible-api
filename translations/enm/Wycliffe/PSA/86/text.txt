The title of the sixte and eiytetithe salm. `The salm of the song of the sones of Chore. The foundementis therof ben in hooli hillis;
the Lord loueth the yatis of Sion, more than alle the tabernaclis of Jacob.
Thou citee of God, with outen ende; gloriouse thingis ben seide of thee.
I schal be myndeful of Raab, and Babiloyne; knowynge me. Lo! aliens, and Tyre, and the puple of Ethiopiens; thei weren there.
Whether a man schal seie to Sion, And a man is born ther ynne; and that man altherhiyeste foundide it?
The Lord schal telle in the scripturis of puplis; and of these princis, that weren ther ynne.
As the dwellyng `of alle that ben glad; is in thee.

The two and threttithe salm hath no title. Ye iust men, haue fulli ioye in the Lord; presyng togidere bicometh riytful men.
Knouleche ye to the Lord in an harpe; synge ye to hym in a sautre of ten strengis.
Synge ye to hym a newe song; seie ye wel salm to hym in criyng.
For the word of the Lord is riytful; and alle hise werkis ben in feithfulnesse.
He loueth merci and doom; the erthe is ful of the merci of the Lord.
Heuenes ben maad stidfast bi the word of the Lord; and `al the vertu of tho bi the spirit of his mouth.
And he gaderith togidere the watris of the see as in a bowge; and settith depe watris in tresours.
Al erthe drede the Lord; sotheli alle men enhabitynge the world ben mouyd of hym.
For he seide, and thingis weren maad; he comaundide, and thingis weren maad of nouyt.
The Lord distrieth the counsels of folkis, forsothe he repreueth the thouytis of puplis; and he repreueth the counsels of prynces.
But the counsel of the Lord dwellith with outen ende; the thouytis of his herte dwellen in generacioun and into generacioun.
Blessid is the folk, whose Lord is his God; the puple which he chees into eritage to hym silf.
The Lord bihelde fro heuene; he siy alle the sones of men.
Fro his dwellyng place maad redi bifor; he bihelde on alle men, that enhabiten the erthe.
Which made syngulerli the soules of hem; which vndurstondith all the werkis of hem.
A kyng is not sauyd bi myche vertu; and a giaunt schal not be sauyd in the mychilnesse of his vertu.
An hors is false to helthe; forsothe he schal not be sauyd in the habundaunce, `ether plentee, of his vertu.
Lo! the iyen of the Lord ben on men dredynge hym; and in hem that hopen on his merci.
That he delyuere her soules fro deth; and feede hem in hungur.
Oure soule suffreth the Lord; for he is oure helpere and defendere.
For oure herte schal be glad in him; and we schulen haue hope in his hooli name.
Lord, thi merci be maad on vs; as we hopiden in thee.

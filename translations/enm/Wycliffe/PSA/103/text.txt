The hundrid and thridde salm. Mi soule, blesse thou the Lord; my Lord God, thou art magnyfied greetli. Thou hast clothid knouleching and fairnesse; and thou art clothid with liyt,
as with a cloth. And thou stretchist forth heuene as a skyn;
and thou hilist with watris the hiyer partis therof. Which settist a cloude thi stiyng; which goest on the fetheris of wyndis.
Which makist spiritis thin aungels; and thi mynystris brennynge fier.
Which hast foundid the erthe on his stablenesse; it schal not be bowid in to the world of world.
The depthe of watris as a cloth is the clothing therof; watris schulen stonde on hillis.
Tho schulen fle fro thi blamyng; men schulen be aferd of the vois of thi thundur.
Hillis stien vp, and feeldis goen doun; in to the place which thou hast foundid to tho.
Thou hast set a terme, which tho schulen not passe; nether tho schulen be turned, for to hile the erthe.
And thou sendist out wellis in grete valeis; watris schulen passe bitwix the myddil of hillis.
Alle the beestis of the feeld schulen drynke; wielde assis schulen abide in her thirst.
Briddis of the eir schulen dwelle on tho; fro the myddis of stoonys thei schulen yyue voices.
And thou moistist hillis of her hiyer thingis; the erthe schal be fillid of the fruyt of thi werkis.
And thou bringist forth hei to beestis; and eerbe to the seruyce of men. That thou bringe forth breed of the erthe;
and that wiyn make glad the herte of men. That he make glad the face with oile; and that breed make stidefast the herte of man.
The trees of the feeld schulen be fillid, and the cedris of the Liban, whiche he plauntide;
sparewis schulen make nest there. The hous of the gerfaukun is the leeder of tho;
hiye hillis ben refute to hertis; a stoon is refutt to irchouns.
He made the moone in to tymes; the sunne knewe his goyng doun.
Thou hast set derknessis, and nyyt is maad; alle beestis of the wode schulen go ther ynne.
Liouns whelpis rorynge for to rauysche; and to seke of God meete to hem silf.
The sunne is risun, and tho ben gaderid togidere; and tho schulen be set in her couchis.
A man schal go out to his werk; and to his worching, til to the euentid.
Lord, thi werkis ben magnefiede ful myche, thou hast maad alle thingis in wisdom; the erthe is fillid with thi possessioun.
This see is greet and large to hondis; there ben crepinge beestis, of which is noon noumbre. Litil beestis with grete;
schippis schulen passe there. This dragoun which thou hast formyd; for to scorne hym.
Alle thingis abiden of thee; that thou yyue to hem meete in tyme.
Whanne thou schalt yyue to hem, thei schulen gadere; whanne thou schalt opene thin hond, alle thingis schulen be fillid with goodnesse.
But whanne thou schalt turne awey the face, thei schulen be disturblid; thou schalt take awei the spirit of them, and thei schulen faile; and thei schulen turne ayen in to her dust.
Sende out thi spirit, and thei schulen be formed of the newe; and thou schalt renule the face of the erthe.
The glorie of the Lord be in to the world; the Lord schal be glad in hise werkis.
Which biholdith the erthe, and makith it to tremble; which touchith hillis, and tho smoken.
I schal singe to the Lord in my lijf; Y schal seie salm to my God, as longe as Y am.
Mi speche be myrie to him; forsothe Y schal delite in the Lord.
Synneris faile fro the erthe, and wickid men faile, so that thei be not; my soule, blesse thou the Lord.

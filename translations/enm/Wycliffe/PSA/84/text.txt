The title of the foure and eiytetithe salm. Of the sones of Chore.
Lord, thou hast blessid thi lond; thou hast turned awei the caitifte of Jacob.
Thou hast foryoue the wickidnesse of thi puple; thou hast hilid alle the synnes of hem.
Thou hast aswagid al thin ire; thou hast turned awei fro the ire of thin indignacioun.
God, oure helthe, conuerte thou vs; and turne awei thin ire fro vs.
Whether thou schalt be wrooth to vs withouten ende; ether schalt thou holde forth thin ire fro generacioun in to generacioun?
God, thou conuertid schalt quykene vs; and thi puple schal be glad in thee.
Lord, schewe thi merci to vs; and yyue thin helthe to vs.
I schal here what the Lord God schal speke in me; for he schal speke pees on his puple. And on hise hooli men; and on hem that ben turned to herte.
Netheles his helthe is niy men dredynge him; that glorie dwelle in oure lond.
Merci and treuthe metten hem silf; riytwisnesse and pees weren kissid.
Treuthe cam forth of erthe; and riytfulnesse bihelde fro heuene.
For the Lord schal yyue benignyte; and oure erthe schal yyue his fruyt.
Riytfulnesse schal go bifore him; and schal sette hise steppis in the weie.

The titil of the sixtithe salm. To the victorie on orgun, to Dauid hym silf.
God, here thou my biseching; yyue thou tent to my preyer.
Fro the endis of the lond Y criede to thee; the while myn herte was angwischid, thou enhaunsidist me in a stoon.
Thou laddest me forth, for thou art maad myn hope; a tour of strengthe fro the face of the enemye.
I schal dwelle in thi tabernacle in to worldis; Y schal be keuered in the hilyng of thi wengis.
For thou, my God, hast herd my preier; thou hast youe eritage to hem that dreden thi name.
Thou schalt adde daies on the daies of the king; hise yeeris til in to the dai of generacioun and of generacioun.
He dwellith with outen ende in the siyt of God; who schal seke the merci and treuthe of hym?
So Y schal seie salm to thi name in to the world of world; that Y yelde my vowis fro dai in to dai.

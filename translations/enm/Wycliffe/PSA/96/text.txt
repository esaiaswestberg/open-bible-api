The sixe and nyntithe salm. The Lord hath regned, the erthe make ful out ioye; many ilis be glad.
Cloude and derknesse in his cumpas; riytfulnesse and doom is amending of his seete.
Fier schal go bifore him; and schal enflawme hise enemyes in cumpas.
Hise leitis schyneden to the world; the erthe siy, and was moued.
Hillis as wax fletiden doun fro the face of the Lord; al erthe fro the face of the Lord.
Heuenes telden his riytfulnesse; and alle puplis sien his glorie.
Alle that worschipen sculptilis be schent, and thei that han glorie in her symelacris; alle ye aungels of the Lord, worschipe him.
Sion herde, and was glad, and the douytris of Juda maden ful out ioye; for `thi domes, Lord.
For thou, Lord, art the hiyeste on al erthe; thou art greetli enhaunsid ouere alle goddis.
Ye that louen the Lord, hate yuel; the Lord kepith the soulis of hise seyntis; he schal delyuer hem fro the hond of the synner.
Liyt is risun to the riytful man; and gladnesse to riytful men of herte.
Juste men, be ye glad in the Lord; and knouleche ye to the mynde of his halewyng.

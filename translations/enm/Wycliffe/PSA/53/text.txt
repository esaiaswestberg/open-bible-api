God, in thi name make thou me saaf; and in thi vertu deme thou me.
God, here thou my preier; with eeris perseyue thou the wordis of my mouth.
For aliens han rise ayens me, and stronge men souyten my lijf; and thei settiden not God bifor her siyt.
For, lo! God helpith me; and the Lord is vptaker of my soule.
Turne thou awei yuelis to myn enemyes; and leese thou hem in thi treuthe.
Wilfuli Y schal make sacrifice to thee; and, Lord, Y schal knouleche to thi name, for it is good.
For thou delyueridist me fro al tribulacioun; and myn iye dispiside on myn enemyes.

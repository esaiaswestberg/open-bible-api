And make ye chast youre soulis in obedience of charite, in loue of britherhod; of simple herte loue ye togidre more bisili.
And be ye borun ayen, not of corruptible seed, `but vncorruptible, bi the word of lyuynge God, and dwellynge in to with outen ende.
For ech fleisch is hey, and al the glorie of it is as flour of hey; the hei driede vp, and his flour felde doun;
but the word of the Lord dwellith with outen ende. And this is the word, that is prechid to you.

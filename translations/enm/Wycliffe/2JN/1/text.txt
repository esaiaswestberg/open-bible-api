The eldere man, to the chosun ladi, and to her children, whiche Y loue in treuthe; and not Y aloone, but also alle men that knowen treuthe;
for the treuthe that dwellith in you, and with you schal be with outen ende.
Grace be with you, merci, and pees of God the fadir, and of Jhesu Crist, the sone of the fadir, in treuthe and charite.
I ioiede ful myche, for Y foond of thi sones goynge in treuthe, as we resseyueden maundement of the fadir.
And now Y preye thee, ladi, not as writinge a newe maundement to thee, but that that we hadden fro the bigynnyng, that we loue ech other.
And this is charite, that we walke after his maundementis. For this is the comaundement, that as ye herden at the bigynnyng, walke ye in hym.
For many disseyueris wenten out in to the world, which knoulechen not that Jhesu Crist hath come in fleisch; this is a disseyuere and antecrist.
Se ye you silf, lest ye lesen the thingis that ye han wrouyt, that ye resseyue ful mede;
witynge that ech man that goith bifore, and dwellith not in the teching of Crist, hath not God. He that dwellith in the teching, hath bothe the sone and the fadir.
If ony man cometh to you, and bryngith not this teching, nyle ye resseyue hym in to hous, nether seie ye to hym, Heil.
For he that seith to hym, Heil, comyneth with hise yuel werkis. Lo! Y biforseide to you, that ye be not confoundid in the dai of oure Lord Jhesu Crist.
Y haue mo thingis to write to you, and Y wolde not bi parchemyn and enke; for Y hope that Y schal come to you, and speke mouth to mouth, that your ioye be ful.
The sones of thi chosun sistir greten thee wel. The grace of God be with thee. Amen.

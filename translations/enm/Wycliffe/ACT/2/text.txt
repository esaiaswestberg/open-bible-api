And whanne the daies of Pentecost weren fillid, alle the disciplis weren togidre in the same place.
And sodeynli ther was maad a sown fro heuene, as of a greet wynde comynge, and it fillide al the hous where thei saten.
And diuerse tungis as fier apperiden to hem, and it sat on ech of hem.
And alle weren fillid with the Hooli Goost, and thei bigunnen to speke diuerse langagis, as the Hooli Goost yaf to hem for to speke.
And ther weren in Jerusalem dwellinge Jewis, religiouse men, of ech nacioun that is vndur heuene.
And whanne this vois was maad, the multitude cam togidere, and thei weren astonyed in thouyt, for ech man herde hem spekinge in his langage.
And alle weren astonyed, and wondriden, and seiden togidere, Whether not alle these that speken ben men of Galyle,
and hou herden we ech man his langage in which we ben borun?
Parthi, and Medi, and Elamyte, and thei that dwellen at Mesopotami, Judee, and Capodosie, and Ponte,
and Asie, Frigie, and Pamfilie, Egipt, and the parties of Libie, that is aboue Sirenen, and `comelingis Romayns, and Jewis,
and proselitis, men of Crete, and of Arabie, we han herd hem spekynge in oure langagis the grete thingis of God.
And alle weren astonyed, and wondriden, `and seiden togidere, What wole this thing be?
And othere scorneden, and seiden, For these men ben ful of must.
But Petre stood with the enleuene, and reiside vp his vois, and spak to hem, Ye Jewis, and alle that dwellen at Jerusalem, be this knowun to you, and with eris perseyue ye my wordis.
For not as ye wenen, these ben dronkun, whanne it is the thridde our of the dai;
but this it is, that was seid bi the prophete Johel,
And it schal be in the laste daies, the Lord seith, Y schal helde out my spirit on ech fleisch; and youre sones and youre douytris schulen prophesie, and youre yonge men schulen se visiouns, and youre eldris schulen dreme sweuenes.
And on my seruauntis and myn handmaidens in tho daies Y schal schede out of my spirit, and thei schulen prophecie.
And Y schal yyue grete wondris in heuene aboue, and signes in erthe bynethe, blood, and fier, and heete of smoke.
The sunne schal be turned in to derknessis, and the moone in to blood, bifor that the greet and the opyn dai of the Lord come.
And it schal be, ech man which euere schal clepe to help the name of the Lord, schal be saaf.
Ye men of Israel, here ye these wordis. Jhesu of Nazareth, a man preued of God bifor you bi vertues, and wondris, and tokenes, which God dide bi hym in the myddil of you,
as ye witen, ye turmentiden, and killiden hym bi the hoondis of wyckid men, bi counseil determyned and bitakun bi the forknouwyng of God.
Whom God reiside, whanne sorewis of helle weren vnboundun, bi that that it was impossible that he were holdun of it.
For Dauid seith of hym, Y saiy afer the Lord bifore me euermore, for he is on my riythalf, that Y be not mouyd.
For this thing myn herte ioiede, and my tunge made ful out ioye, and more ouere my fleisch schal reste in hope.
For thou schalt not leeue my soule in helle, nethir thou schalt yiue thin hooli to se corrupcioun.
Thou hast maad knowun to me the weies of lijf, thou schalt fille me in myrthe with thi face.
Britheren, be it leueful boldli to seie to you of the patriark Dauid, for he is deed and biried, and his sepulcre is among vs in to this dai.
Therfore whanne he was a prophete, and wiste, that with a greet ooth God hadde sworn to hym, that of the fruyt of his leende schulde oon sitte on his seete,
he seynge afer spak of the resurreccioun of Crist, for nether he was left in helle, nether his fleisch saiy corrupcioun.
God reiside this Jhesu, to whom we alle ben witnessis.
Therfor he was enhaunsid bi the riythoond of God, and thorouy the biheest of the Hooli Goost that he took of the fadir, he schedde out this spirit, that ye seen and heren.
For Dauid stiede not in to heuene; but he seith, The Lord seide to my Lord,
Sitte thou on my riyt half, til Y putte thin enemyes a stool of thi feet.
Therfor moost certeynli wite al the hous of Israel, that God made hym bothe Lord and Crist, this Jhesu, whom ye crucefieden.
Whanne thei herden these thingis, thei weren compunct in herte; and thei seiden to Petre and othere apostlis, Britheren, what schulen we do?
And Petre seide to hem, Do ye penaunce, and eche of you be baptisid in the name of Jhesu Crist, in to remissioun of youre synnes; and ye schulen take the yifte of the Hooli Goost.
For the biheest is to you, and to youre sones, and to alle that ben fer, which euer oure Lord God hath clepid.
Also with othere wordis ful many he witnesside to hem, and monestide hem, and seide, Be ye sauyd fro this schrewid generacioun.
Thanne thei that resseyueden his word weren baptisid, and in that dai soulis weren encreesid, aboute thre thousinde;
and weren lastynge stabli in the teching of the apostlis, and in comynyng of the breking of breed, in preieris.
And drede was maad to ech man. And many wondris and signes weren don bi the apostlis in Jerusalem, and greet drede was in alle.
And alle that bileueden weren togidre, and hadden alle thingis comyn.
Thei selden possessiouns and catel, and departiden tho thingis to alle men, as it was nede to ech.
And ech dai thei dwelliden stabli with o wille in the temple, and braken breed aboute housis, and token mete with ful out ioye and symplenesse of herte,
and herieden togidere God, and hadden grace to al the folk. And the Lord encreside hem that weren maad saaf, ech dai in to the same thing.

And profetis and doctouris weren in the chirche that was at Antioche, in which Barnabas, and Symount, that was clepid Blac, and Lucius Cironense, and Manaen, that was the soukynge fere of Eroude tetrarke, and Saul weren.
And whanne thei mynystriden to the Lord, and fastiden, the Hooli Goost seide to hem, Departe ye to me Saul and Barnabas, in to the werk to which Y haue takun hem.
Thanne thei fastiden, and preieden, and leiden hondis on hem, and leten hem go.
But thei weren sent of the Hooli Goost, and wenten forth to Seleucia, and fro thennus thei wenten bi boot to Cipre.
And whanne thei camen to Salamyne, thei prechiden the word of God in the synagogis of Jewis; and thei hadden also Joon in mynystrie.
And whanne thei hadden walkid bi al the ile to Pafum, thei founden a man, a witche, a false profete, a Jewe, to whom the name was Bariesu,
that was with the proconsul Sergius Paule, a prudent man. This clepide Barnabas and Poul, and desiride to here the word of God.
But Elymas witche withstoode hem; for his name is expowned so; and he souyte to turne awei the proconsul fro bileue.
But Saul, which is seid also Paul, was fillid with the Hooli Goost, and bihelde in to hym, and seide, A!
thou ful of al gile, and al falsnesse, thou sone of the deuel, thou enemye of al riytwisnesse, thou leeuest not to turne vpsodoun the riytful weies of the Lord.
And now lo! the hoond of the Lord is on thee, and thou schalt be blynde, and not seynge the sunne in to a tyme. And anoon myste and derknesse felden doun on hym; and he yede aboute, and souyte hym that schulde yyue hoond to hym.
Thanne the proconsul, whanne he hadde seyn the dede, bileuede, wondringe on the techyng of the Lord.
And whanne fro Pafum Poul hadde go bi a boot, and thei that weren with hym, thei camen to Pergen of Pamfilie; but Joon departide fro hem, and turnede ayen to Jerusalem.
And thei yeden to Pergen, and camen to Antioche of Persidie; and thei entriden in to the synagoge in the dai of sabatis, and saten.
And after the redyng of the lawe and of the prophetis, the princis of the synagoge senten to hem, and seiden, Britheren, if ony word of exortacioun to the puple is in you, seie ye.
And Poul roos, and with hoond baad silence, and seide, Men of Israel, and ye that dreden God, here ye.
God of the puple of Israel chees oure fadris, and enhaunside the puple, whanne thei weren comelingis in the loond of Egipt, and in an hiy arme he ledde hem out of it;
and bi the tyme of fourti yeeris he suffride her maneres in desert.
And he destriede seuene folkis in the loond of Canaan, and bi sort departide to hem her lond,
as aftir foure hundrid and fifti yeeris. And aftir these thingis he yaf domesmen, to Samuel, the profete.
And fro that tyme thei axiden a kyng, and God yaf to hem Saul, the sone of Cis, a man of the lynage of Beniamyn, bi fourti yeeris.
And whanne he was don awei, he reiside to hem Dauid king, to whom he bar witnessing, and seide, Y haue foundun Dauid, the sone of Jesse, a man aftir myn herte, which schal do alle my willis.
Of whos seed bi the biheest God hath led out to Israel a sauyoure Jhesu,
whanne Joon prechide bifor the face of his comyng the baptym of penaunce to al the puple of Israel.
But whanne Joon fillide his cours, he seide, Y am not he, whom ye demen me to be; but lo! he cometh aftir me, and Y am not worthi to doon of the schoon of hise feet.
Britheren, and sones of the kynde of Abraham, and whiche that in you dreden God, to you the word of helthe is sent.
For thei that dwelliden at Jerusalem, and princis of it, that knewen not this Jhesu, and the voicis of prophetis, that by euery sabat ben red, demyden, and filliden;
and thei founden in hym no cause of deth, and axiden of Pilat, that thei schulden sle hym.
And whanne thei hadden endid alle thingis that weren writun of hym, thei token hym doun of the tre, and leiden hym in a graue.
And God reiside hym fro deth in the thridde dai; which was seyn bi mony daies to
hem that wenten vp togidere with hym fro Galilee in to Jerusalem, which ben til now his witnessis to the puple.
And we schewen to you the biheest that was maad to oure fadris;
for God hath fulfillid this to her sones, and ayenreisid Jhesu; as in the secounde salm it is writun, Thou art my sone, to dai Y bigat thee.
And he ayenreiside hym fro deth, that he schulde not turne ayen in to corrupcioun, seide thus, For Y schal yyue to you the hooli trewe thingis of Dauid.
And therfor and on an othere stide he seith, Thou schalt not yyue thin hooli to se corrupcioun.
But Dauid in his generacioun, whanne he hadde mynstrid to the wille of God, diede, and was leid with hise fadris, and say corrupcioun;
but he whom God reiside fro deth, say not corrupcioun.
Therfor, britheren, be it knowun to you, that bi hym remyssioun of synnes is teld to you, fro alle synnes, of whiche ye myyten not be iustified in the lawe of Moises.
In this ech man that bileueth, is iustified.
Therfor se ye, that it come not to you, that is biforeseid in the profetis,
Ye dispiseris, se ye, and wondre ye, and be ye scaterid abrood; for Y worche a werk in youre daies, a werk that ye schulen not bileue, if ony man schal telle it to you.
And whanne thei yeden out, thei preieden, that in the sabat suynge thei schulden speke to hem these wordis.
And whanne the synagoge was left, manye of Jewis and of comelingis worschypynge God supeden Poul and Barnabas; that spaken, and counseliden hem, that thei schulden dwelle in the grace of God.
And in the sabat suynge almest al the citee cam togidir, to here the word of God.
And Jewis sien the puple, and weren fillid with enuye, and ayenseiden these thingis that weren seyd of Poul, and blasfemyden.
Thanne Poul and Barnabas stidfastli seiden, To you it bihofte first to speke the word of God; but for ye putten it awei, and han demyd you vnworthi to euerlastinge lijf, lo! we turnen to hethen men.
For so the Lord comaundide vs, Y haue set thee in to liyt to hethen men, that thou be in to helthe to the vtmest of erthe.
And hethen men herden, `and ioieden, and glorifieden the word of the Lord; and bileueden, as manye as weren bifore ordeyned to euerlastinge lijf.
And the word of the Lord was sowun bi al the cuntre.
But the Jewis stiriden religiouse wymmen, and onest, and the worthiest men of the citee, and stireden persecucioun ayens Poul and Barnabas, and dryuen hem out of her cuntreis.
And thei schoken awei in to hem the duste of her feet, and camen to Yconye.
And the disciplis weren fillid with ioye and the Hooli Goost.

And he bihiyte, and he souyte oportunyte, to bitraye hym, with outen puple.
But the daies of therf looues camen, in whiche it was neede, that the sacrifice of pask were slayn.
And he sente Petre and Joon, and seide, Go ye, and make ye redi to vs the pask, that we ete.
And thei seiden, Where wolt thou, that we make redi?
And he seide to hem, Lo! whanne ye schulen entre in to the citee, a man berynge a vessel of watir schal meete you; sue ye hym in to the hous, in to which he entrith.

And whanne he hadde take the cuppe, he dide gracis, and seide, Take ye, and departe ye among you;

And thei bigunnen to seke among hem, who it was of hem, that was to do this thing.
And strijf was maad among hem, which of hem schulde be seyn to be grettest.
But he seide to hem, Kyngis of hethen men ben lordis of hem, and thei that han power on hem ben clepid good doeris, but ye not so;

For who is gretter, he that sittith at the mete, or he that mynystrith? whether not he that sittith at the mete? And Y am in the myddil of you, as he that mynystrith.
And ye ben, that han dwellid with me in my temptaciouns; and Y dispose to you,

For Y seie to you, that yit it bihoueth that thing that is writun to be fulfillid in me, And he is arettid with wickid men; for tho thingis that ben of me han ende.
And thei seiden, Lord, lo! twei swerdis here. And he seide to hem, It is ynowy.
And he yede out, and wente aftir the custom in to the hille of Olyues; and the disciplis sueden hym.
And whanne he cam to the place, he seide to hem, Preye ye, lest ye entren in to temptacioun.

And thei that weren aboute hym, and sayn that that was to come, seiden to hym, Lord, whether we smyten with swerd?
And oon of hem smoot the seruaunt of the prince of preestis, and kittide of his riyt eere.
But Jhesus answerde, and seide, Suffre ye til hidir. And whanne he hadde touchid his eere, he heelide hym.
And Jhesus seide to hem, that camen to hym, the princis of preestis, and maiestratis of the temple, and eldre men, As to a theef ye han gon out with swerdis and staues?
Whanne Y was ech dai with you in the temple, ye streiyten not out hondis in to me; but this is youre our, and the power of derknessis.
And thei token him, and ledden to the hous of the prince of prestis; and Petir suede hym afer.

And thei blynfelden hym, and smyten his face, and axiden hym, and seiden, Arede, thou Crist, to vs, who is he that smoot thee?
Also thei blasfemynge seiden ayens hym many other thingis.
And as the day was come, the eldre men of the puple, and the princis of prestis, and the scribis camen togidir, and ledden hym in to her councel,

And thei seiden, What yit desiren we witnessyng? for we vs silf han herd of his mouth.

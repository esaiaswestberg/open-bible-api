Forsothe Azarie, the sone of Obeth, whanne the spirit of the Lord was comyn in to hym,
yede out in to the metyng of Asa; and seide to hym, Asa and al Juda and Beniamyn, here ye me; the Lord is with you, for ye weren with hym; if ye seken hym, ye schulen fynde hym; sotheli if ye forsaken hym, he schal forsake you.
Forsothe many daies schulen passe in Israel with outen veri God, and without preest, and without techere, and without lawe.
And whanne thei turnen ayen in her angwisch, and crien to the Lord God of Israel, and seken hym, thei schulen fynde hym.
In that tyme schal not be pees to go out and to go in, but dredis on al side on alle the dwelleris of londis.
For a folk schal fiyte ayens folk, and a citee ayens a citee, for the Lord schal disturble hem in al anguysch;
but be ye coumfortid, and youre hondis be not slakid; for mede schal be to youre werk.
And whanne Asa hadde herd this thing, that is, the wordis and profesye of Asarie, the sone of Obed, the profete, he was coumfortid, and he dide a wei alle the idols fro al the lond of Juda and of Beniamyn, and fro the citees whiche he hadde take of the hil of Effraym. And he halewide the auter of the Lord, that was bifor the porche of the hows of the Lord.
And he gaderide togidere al Juda and Beniamyn, and with hem the comelyngis of Effraym, and of Manasses, and of Symeon; for manye of Israel, seynge that his Lord God was with hym, fledden ouer to hym.
And whanne thei hadden comun in to Jerusalem, in the thridde monethe, in the fiftenthe yeer of the rewme of Asa,
thei offriden `to the Lord in that dai, bothe of the spuylis and of the prey, which thei hadden brouyt, seuene hundrid oxis, and seuene thousynde wetheris.
And Asa entride bi custom to make strong the boond of pees, that thei schulden seke the Lord God of her fadris in al her herte, and in al her soule.
Sotheli he seide, If ony man sekith not the Lord God of Israel, die he, fro the leeste `til to the mooste, fro man `til to womman.
And alle that weren in Juda sworen with cursyng to the Lord, with greet vois, in hertli song, and in sown of trumpe, and in sown of clariouns;
for thei sworen in al her herte, and in al the wille thei souyten hym, and founden hym; and the Lord yaf to hem reste bi cumpas.
But also he puttide doun Maacha, the modir of `Asa the kyng, fro the streit empire, for sche hadde made in a wode the symylacre, `ether licnesse, of a mannus yerde; and he al to-brak al `that symylacre, and pownede it in to gobetis, and `brente it in the stronde of Cedron.
But hiy places weren left in Israel; netheles the herte of Asa was riytful in alle hise daies.
And he brouyte in to the hows of the Lord tho thingis that his fadir avowide, siluer and gold, and dyuerse purtenaunce of vessels;
sotheli batel was not `til to the threttithe yeer of the rewme of Asa.

Aftir these thingis Moises and Aaron entriden, and seiden to Farao, The Lord God of Israel seith these thingis, Delyuere thou my puple, that it make sacrifice to me in deseert.
And he answeride, Who is the Lord, that Y here his vois, and delyuere Israel? I knowe not the Lord, and Y schal not delyuere Israel.
Thei seiden, God of Ebrews clepide vs, that we go the weie of thre daies in to wildirnesse, and that we make sacrifice to oure Lord God, lest perauenture pestilence, ether swerd, bifalle to vs.
The kyng of Egipt seide to hem, Moises and Aaron, whi stiren ye the puple fro her werkis? Go ye to youre chargis.
And Farao seide, The puple of the loond is myche; ye seen that the cumpany hath encreessid; hou myche more schal it encreesse, if ye schulen yyue to hem reste fro werkis.
Therfor Farao comaundide in that dai to the maistris of werkis, and to rente gadereris of the puple,
and seide, Ye schulen no more yyue stre to the puple, to make tijl stoonys as bifore; but go thei, and gedere stobil;
and ye schulen sette on hem the mesure of tijl stoonys, which thei maden bifore, nether ye schulen abate ony thing; for thei ben idil, and therfor thei crien, and seien, Go we, and make we sacrifice to oure God;
be thei oppressid bi werkis, and fille thei tho, that thei assente not to the false wordis.
Therfor the maistris of the workis and the rente gadereris yeden out to the puple, and seiden, Thus seith Farao, Y yyue not to you stre;
go ye, and gadere, if ye moun fynde ony where; nether ony thing schal be decreessid of youre werk.
And the puple was scaterid bi al the lond of Egipt to gadre stre.
And the maystris of werkis weren bisi, and seiden, Fille ye youre werk ech dai, as ye weren wont to do, whanne the stre was youun to you.
And thei, that weren maistris of the werkis of the sones of Israel, weren betun of the rent gadereris of Farao, that seiden, Whi filliden ye not the mesure of tijl stoonus, as bifore, nether yistirdai nethir to dai?
And the souereyns of the sonys of Israel camen, and crieden to Farao, and seiden, Whi doist thou so ayens thi seruauntis?
Stre is not youun to vs, and tijl stoonus ben comaundid in lijk manere. Lo! we thi seruauntis ben betun with scourgis, and it is doon vniustli ayens thi puple.
Farao seide, Ye yyuen tent to idilnesse, and therfor ye seien, Go we, and make we sacrifice to the Lord;
therfor go ye, and worche; stre schal not be youun to you, and ye schulen yelde the customable noumbre of tijl stoonus.
And the souereyns of the children of Israel sien hem silf in yuel, for it was seid to hem, No thing schal be decreessid of tijl stoonus bi alle daies.
And thei `camen to Moises and Aaron, that stoden euene ayens, and thei `yeden out fro Farao,
and seiden to `Moises and Aaron, The Lord se, and deme, for ye han maad oure odour to stynke bifore Farao and hise seruauntis; and ye han youe to hym a swerd, that he schulde sle vs.
And Moises turnede ayen to the Lord, and seide, Lord, whi hast thou turmentid this puple? why sentist thou me?
For sithen Y entride to Farao, that Y schulde speke in thi name, thou hast turmentid thi puple, and hast not delyuered hem.

And thou schalt ouergilde the bord with purest gold, and thou schalt make to it a goldun brynke `bi cumpas;

Sixe yerdis schulen go out of the sidis, thre of o side, and thre of the tother.
Thre cuppis as in the maner of a note bi ech yerde, and litle rundelis to gidere, and a lilie, and in lijk maner thre cuppis at the licnesse of a note in the tother, and litle rundelis togidere, and a lilie; this schal be the werk of sixe yerdis, that schulen be brouyt forth of the schaft.

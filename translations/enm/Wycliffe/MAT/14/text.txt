And he willynge to sle hym, dredde the puple; for thei hadden hym as a prophete.

And hise disciplis camen, and token his bodi, and birieden it; and thei camen, and tolden to Jhesu.
And whanne Jhesus hadde herd this thing, he wente fro thennus in a boot, in to desert place bisides. And whanne the puple hadde herd, thei folewiden hym on her feet fro citees.
And Jhesus yede out, and sai a greet puple, and hadde reuthe on hem, and heelide the sike men of hem.
But whanne the euentid was com, hise disciplis camen to him, and seiden, The place is desert, and the tyme is now passid; lat the puple go in to townes, to bye hem mete.

And whanne the puple was left, he stiede aloone in to an hil for to preie. But whanne the euenyng was come, he was there aloone.

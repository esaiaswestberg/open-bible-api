Forsothe in that tyme Miyhel, the greet prince, schal rise, that stondith for the sones of thi puple. And tyme schal come, what maner tyme was not, fro that tyme fro which folkis bigunnen to be, `vn to that tyme. And in that tyme thi puple schal be saued, ech that is foundun writun in the book of life.
And many of hem that slepen in the dust of erthe, schulen awake fulli, summe in to euerlastynge lijf, and othere in to schenschipe, that thei se euere.
Forsothe thei that ben tauyt, schulen schyne as the schynyng of the firmament, and thei that techen many men to riytfulnesse, schulen schyne as sterris in to euerlastynge euerlastyngnessis.

And Y, Danyel, siy, and lo! as tweyne othere men stood; oon stood on this side, on the brenk of the flood, and another on that side, on the tother part of the flood.
And Y seide to the man, that was clothid in lynnun clothis, that stood on the watris of the flood, Hou long schal be the ende of these merueils?
And Y herde the man, that was clothid in lynnun clothis, that stood on the watris of the flood, whanne he hadde reisid his riythond and lefthond to heuene, and hadde sworun by hym that lyueth with outen ende, For in to a tyme, and tymes, and the half of tyme. And whanne the scateryng of the hoond of the hooli puple is fillid, alle these thingis schulen be fillid.
And Y herde, and vndurstood not; and Y seide, My lord, what schal be aftir these thingis?
And he seide, Go thou, Danyel, for the wordis ben closid and aseelid, til to the tyme determyned.

He is blessid, that abideth, and cometh fulli, til a thousynde daies thre hundrid and fyue and thritti.
But go thou, Danyel, to the tyme determyned; and thou schalt reste, and stonde in thi part, in the ende of daies.
